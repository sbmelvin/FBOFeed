The DSOL database developed by DeLima Associates is the only commercially available dietary supplement database approved by CDC under the SBIR program.  NLM’s Toxicology and Environmental Information Program (TEHIP) has received and evaluated the demonstration version of this database.  The DSOL database is a relational database that contains product information for about 1,000 individual brands of dietary supplements, including brand name, form, active and inactive ingredients, amount of active ingredient/unit, suggested dose, health claims, warning, percentage Daily Value, universal product code, (UPC), manufacturer/distributor information, and other label information.  Information is provided for vitamins, minerals, botanicals, amino acids, energy/weight loss and specialty supplements.  Also included in the database is manufacturer contact information and product testing results, when available.  The DSOL database has a user-friendly, front-end application for researchers that will search the database by brand name, manufacturer/distributor name, active ingredient, and keyword.  The database also contains samples of active ingredient fact sheets, data on health effects of active ingredients, a medical conditions-active ingredients lookup table, samples of access to clinical research regarding medical condition-active ingredients lookup table, samples of access to clinical research regarding medical conditions, and links to government Web sites that contain dietary supplement and nutrition information.  This database is unique in that it identifies Chemical Abstract Service (CAD) registry numbers for each ingredient thereby allowing the ability to link each ingredient to other NLM databases.  It also compares the percentage of federal government-recommended daily nutrient intake values obtained from each dietary supplement brand.

This service will be solicited using FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions).  

This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all interested parties may submit a capabilities statement which will be considered by the NLM.  The capabilities statement should demonstrate that the interested party is able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.

<DESC>Asia is the largest and fastest growing region in the world, with more than half the world’s population, the largest number of the world’s poor, and among the world’s most diverse and endangered ecosystems.  Improving water supply and sanitation for the urban poor is among the highest priorities in Asia, as is strengthening governance as a cross-cutting theme in all environmental areas.  Some significant transboundary concerns in Asia, like water and natural resources management, have become flashpoints for cross-border conflict.  To address these leading environmental challenges, the USAID Regional Development Mission/Asia (RDM/A) intends to issue a request for proposals for technical support services addressing a combination of regional environmental program activities in Asia to:  (1) improve access to clean water and sanitation in Asian cities; (2) strengthen environmental governance and promote transboundary cooperation; and (3) provide overarching support to RDM/A’s Environment Office in performance monitoring, communications, technical exchanges, and other administrative areas.  The period of performance will be four years, beginning on or about October 1, 2005 with an estimated total budget ranging from $13 million to $16 million.  A majority of resources will be applied to the first program area.  All program areas build directly on current activities of the United States-Asia Environmental Partnership (US-AEP) program, and are based in part on the results of an assessment, “US-AEP Strategy and Program Design: Strategic Assessment Report” (September 2004) and a public Town Hall meeting held in October 2004 in Washington (see www.usaep.org/resources).  In line with the overall objective of RDM/A, this procurement will seek to promote regional initiatives that catalyze key stakeholders in Asia to share experiences, technical innovations, and expertise, and to improve cooperation between Asian countries, cities, and communities to address leading environmental challenges in the region.  The programs will operate in USAID presence and non-presence countries in Southeast Asia, East Asia, and South Asia, often in coordination with USAID Bilateral Missions and other international donors.  

USAID anticipates awarding a cost-reimbursable contract for the four-year program beginning on or about October 1, 2005.  Detailed information about this solicitation is contained in the RFP documents that will be available on or about April 1, 2005 on this website.  The closing date for the submission of the proposals, to be specified in the RFP, will be about 45 days thereafter.  All questions related to this notice must be addressed in writing, fax or email, to the Regional Contracting Officer (RCO) at the address stated above.

The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Internet.  By exception, USAID can provide the solicitation on a 3.5" floppy disk (MS WordXP format), via e-mail, or in hard copy.  Requestors must confirm to the RCO their inability to access the RFP via the Internet before they request a diskette or hard copy of the document.  The notice can be viewed and downloaded using this website.  The solicitation, once issued, can also be downloaded from this website.  Requestors are encouraged to access the solicitation via the Internet as this eliminates possible delays associated with mailing in general, and from overseas Missions, in particular. 
	
Requestors must confirm in writing to the RCO receipt of the solicitation through the Internet.  As the recipient of this solicitation document, the requestor is responsible for ensuring that you have received it from the Internet in its entirety.  USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes.  Further, please be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on the same Internet site where the solicitation was posted.  Generally, the RCO will send a copy of RFP amendments to all those who have sent in the written confirmation of solicitation receipt.  However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the Internet.  Requestors are therefore advised to regularly check the FedBizOpps website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/) for amendments.  The publication of this notice does not obligate the USG to award a contract.

<DESC>REQUIREMENT:
The U.S. Government is seeking to lease 10,447 rentable square feet yielding 9,084 usable square feet of contiguous office and related space for the Federal Bureau of Investigations in Sierra Vista, Arizona.  Space must be located in a prime commercial office district with attractive, prestigious surroundings with a prevalence of modern design, tasteful rehabilitation in modern use or new construction.  Offered space in an existing building must be located above the ground floor or first floor (street level) of the building.  If new construction is offered, ground floor or first floor (street level) space would be acceptable.

LOCATION:
The U.S. government will be evaluating offers within the delineated area within Sierra Vista, Arizona as follows:

AREA OF CONSIDERATION: 
NORTH: Highway 90;
EAST: Avenida del Sol which turns into Guilio Cesare Avenue;
SOUTH: East on Avenida Cochise, South on Highway 92, then East on Greenbriar Road;
WEST: Coronado Drive. 

All prospective buildings/properties must be physically located within (not front or border) the delineated boundary.

Regularly scheduled public transportation and/or employee parking within one (1) block sufficient to cover commuting and visitor needs should be available.  

Space should be located with a variety of inexpensive, and moderately priced fast food and/or eat-in restaurants within three blocks, and other employee services such as retail shops, cleaners, banks, etc. should be available within one-half (1/2) mile.

Setback refers to the distance from the face of the building's exterior to the protected/defended perimeter (i.e., any potential point of explosion).

<DESC>Previously, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) posted two pre-solicitation notices to FedBizzOpps with regard to the anticipated Geostationary operational Satellite, series R (GOES-R) Program Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) solicitation. The first notice was posted November 29, 2004 and the second was posted February 2, 2005. The notices provided background to the NOAA GOES-R acquisition and suggested an RFP release date of March 15, 2005. Due to internal review scheduling conflicts, the GOES-R Program did not release the RFP on March 15, 2005. NOAA anticipates that the GOES-R RFP release date will be on or about March 22, 2005. 


NOAA’s GOES-R Program office provided the GOES-R PDRR Partial Draft RFP on December 30, 2004 and a full Draft RFP on January 28, 2005. These and other documents are available through the GOES-R Program web site http://osd.goes.noaa.gov/index.php. It was anticipated that the Program will release another Draft RFP March 15, 2005. While several of the documents have recently been updated, a full draft RFP will not be released at this time. We encourage interested parties to view the information posted to the GOES-R Program web site.

For the superintendent’s office, it needs to have a desk with drawer storage; NO overheads and lateral files can be separate from desk unit.  The secretary’s area needs to be very open and welcoming to customers with the secretary facing the main entrance (note drawings). This should include: a desk, lateral files, and personal desk storage drawers.  Also, include in the Secretarial area: 2 chairs and 1 small table as seen in description.   The Furniture for the Secretary and Superintendent’s office needs to be the same.  This furniture can be a different type (style line) than LCGA and LBCB.

<DESC>CDC, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, DART, located in Cincinnati intends to negotiate with Particle Instruments, LLC to procure for a Standard 10 lpm ELPl-01; ELPl Electrical Filter Stage; Vaccuum Hose (1.5m) pressure value & NWIG flange connectors; Vaccuum Pump SV25B, 115 1/60 Hz for 10, 20 & 30 lpm impactor; and Sintered Collection Plate Set.  The procurement is for a real-time size-selective personal and area sampling instrument for aerosol concentration measurements in the aerodynamic size range of  7 nanometers to 10 microns. The instrument employs a 13 stage, low—pressure cascade impactor, with real—time detection, involving an initial electrical charging stage and subsequent current measurement on each of the 13 impactor stages. A vacuum pump provides the low pressure sampling flow necessary to extend the size range into the ultrafine range. The supplied software runs on a user-provided PC, allowing for data acquisition, display in real time and basic analysis, as well as control of instrument parameters. The instrument can be used in the lab or in the field. By placing sampling media on the stages, subsequent gravimetric, chemical and morphological analyses can be performed. Also, by turning the charging unit off, aerosol charge can be measured.  In addition to the real-time sizing capabilities, the product can provide the charge vs. diameter on aerosols in real-time.  Further project requirements are to determine mass vs. size, morphology and chemistry of ultrafine particles, which the ELPl will allow for in conjunction with other apparatus.  Firms that believe they can provide the required equipment are encouraged to identify themselves and give written product information to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of this synopsis.  A determination not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Please address all inquiries to Margaret L. Mooney at CDC/PGO/AAFB/Pittsburgh, (412)386-6431 or E-mail zia3@cdc.gov.  All responsible sources may submit a response which shall be considered by the agency.

According to the language included in FAR Case 2001-026, vendors are required to use ORCA beginning 1 January 2005.  Detailed information can be found!  in the FAR Case, as well as by visiting the Help section of the website at http://orca.bpn.gov. The help section includes ORCA background information, frequently asked questions (FAQ), the ORCA Handbook, and whom to call for assistance.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement to build several additional large-scale test panels, and fabricate several system-level aeroshell prototypes under an existing NASA Research Announcement (NRA 02-OSS-01) award that LaRC received in 2002.	The additional test panels and prototypes will require additional work, part of which will be performed under existing NASA Contract NAS1-03058. This contract was initiated to identify candidate thermal protection system (TPS) materials known as ablators, and to conduct TPS ablation response analysis. The contract was initiated as part of NASA LaRC's research effort under NRA 02-OSS-01, entitled “Research Opportunities in Space Science – 2002”. This NRA solicited proposals for supporting research and technology across a broad range of space science program elements relevant to one or more of the four defined Office of Space Science (OSS) science themes, entitled Astronomical Search of Origins, Solar Systems Exploration, Structure and Evolution of the Universe, and The Sun-Earth Connection.  NASA/LaRC intends to issue a contract modification on a sole source basis to Applied Research Associates, Inc. (ARA) to support the fabrication of additional test panels and prototypes which must include application of  TPS materials to enable evaluation at the system level. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, “Only one responsible source”. Applied Research Associates, Inc. (ARA) was competitively selected as partner on the NRA/OSS project, resulting in the NASA Contract NAS1-03058, based on their unique experience and capability to support the advanced material evaluations and tests required by Langley. The TPS materials of interest (SRAM and PhenCarb) are proprietary to ARA, and are not available from any other source. ARA has unique knowledge of the handling, processing, testing, and performance characteristics of SRAM and PhenCarb materials, which is essential to the success of the project.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.	All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. See note 22.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to purchase Services to Genetically Modify Mouse Strains from Ozgene Pty Ltd., 5 Parker Place, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia.  The services included are:   1) Design and constrction of the required targeting vector.  All steps should be verified at the highest standard of proof for having been correctly performed.  The vector should carry adequate lengths of homologous sequence on either side of the alteration to give a high probability of correct integration at the targeting site in the genome.  Due attention should be paid to the mouse strain of origin of the homologous sequences to optimize the probability of achieving a specific targeted integration as opposed to non-homologous random integration in the genome.  The vector should incorporate standard elements including a neomycin-resistance marker and flanking sites (such as loxP) that allow for the later excision of the marker after successful targeting of the gene has been achieved.  The vector should incorporate a complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence for another gene of interest.  This should be sued in-frame at a suitable region of the targeted gene such that the cDNA sequence will be expressed and translated properly under the control of the promoter and regulatory regions of the targeted gene in the mouse.  2) Selection of recombinant ES cell clones carrying the correctly targeted insertion at the gene of interest.  The linearized targeting vector should be introduced into the ES cells and colonies carrying the integrated vector should be selected based on criteria including neomycin-resistance and direct demonstration of correct homologous recombination by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA.  3) Generation of mice carrying the mutation.  Correctly targeted ES cell clones with correct karyotypes should be used to generate founder mice by injection of the cells into blastocysts of a host mouse strain.  Transmission of the mutation by the founder mice should be demonstrated following backcrossing and direct demonstration by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA.  The provider should have demonstrated experience with appropriate technology to remove the neomycin marker while retaining the desired alteration at the targeted gene.  A Statement of Work describing the services and Contractor Requirements will be provided as part of the Request for Quote package.  The Institute intends to obtain this service by other than full and open competition from Ozgene Pty Ltd.  To the best of the Governments knowledge the proposed contractor is the only known source that can provide this type of service. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider all responses received before the closing date of this announcement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is anticipated that the Request for Quotation (RFQ) NIH-NIDDK-05-398 will be available fifteen (15) days after the release of the RFQ.  Receipt of quotations will be due ten (10) days after the release of the RFQ.  The anticipated award date is April 18, 2005.  Request for copies of the RFQ must be in writing to the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 6707 Democracy Blvd., Room 774C, Bethesda, MD 20817 Attention:  Patricia Haun.  FAX quotations must contain offerors name, address, telephone number and fax number.  FAX quotations will be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) seeks to increase level of effort under a current contractor with Bert Smith & Co., Contract No. PBGC01-CT-04-0693.  Under this contract, Bert Smith is performing professional accounting support with PBGC's Financial Operations Department (FOD) relating to PBGC's trust operations.  An increase of 3,135 hours to the existing performance period and 6,630 hours in the remaining option periods 2 and 3, this is necessary to offset an unforeseen increase in the number of pension plans assumed by the PBGC.  In view of this contractor's familiarity with the complexities of PBGC's trust operations, it would not be practicable to obtain this additional support through another contractor.   This is not a request for proposal.  See Note 22.

<DESC>Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) for Support Equipment for the Air Force Subscale Aerial Target (AFSAT) - The Air Armament Center, Aerial Targets SPO, Contracts Office, Eglin AFB FL, intends to issue a sole-source modification to an existing contract with Composite Engineering Inc, located at 5381 Raley Blvd., Sacramento, CA 92632.   This sole source modification will be for the purchase of specialized support equipment to be used for handling, functional pre-flight checkout, launch, and recovery during operations with the Air Force Sub-scale Aerial Target (AFSAT) procured under the referenced contract.  The base contract was competitively awarded using full and open competition procedures.  Specialized support equipment was part of the original proposals; however, the extent to which this equipment would be necessary was not anticipated.  As such, the base contract covered only a fraction on the equipment required.  This equipment is designed especially to work with the AFSAT and is required to be provided by March 06 in order to meet the Required Assets Available (RAA) schedule.  It is anticipated that only Composite Engineering Inc. has the ability to provide this equipment.  No Government-owned technical data package exists to allow any other companies to become knowledgeable about the AFSAT design.   The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition is 336411 with a size standard of 1,500 employees.   Composite Engineering Inc. is the prime contractor for the current AFSAT contract and has been since the inception of the program in 2002.  The government has determined that the only way to minimize adverse impact to critical mission activities requiring continuous availability of sub-scale aerial targets and associated support equipment is to issue a modification to the existing contract to the incumbent vendor. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested parties may submit statements of capability (SOC) demonstrating their ability to deliver AFSAT compatible specialize support equipment in time to meet the RAA date of March 06.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This Sources Sought Synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  As directed by the Foreign Disclosure Office, Eglin AFB, no foreign participation shall be allowed for this effort. The Government anticipates awarding the modification in March 2005.

<DESC>National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to negotiate an award on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 with GiziMap, 1-24 Budapest Bogar u. 6. Hungary. GiziMap will provide unlimited copyright permission to NGA.  This requirement will allow NGA to provide geospatial data to our military customers and to other government entities if necessary. This data will augment NGA’s current sources, thus providing a valuable resource to customers.
	The purpose for requesting permission to use this copyright is due to the fact that the limited copyright permission (previously for 25,000 Iraqi roadmaps), has expired. The description of the supplies or services necessary to meet NGA’s requirement are the following: the NGA Office of Central and Southwest Asia is supporting the nation’s critical geospatial intelligence requirements for their region in support of the Global War on Terror (GWOT).  This contract will provide  copyright permission to reproduce an unlimited quantity of Iraq Roadmaps produced by GiziMap and modified by the Military Corps Intelligence Activity (MCIA). The contract will allow for an exclusive, government-only license. Maps provide an invaluable tool for supporting continued military operations in Iraq. The maps will enable the military to facilitate better interoperability between the forces and provide an additional resource to aid troops in the GWOT. The fact that the maps provided by GiziMap are an existing product (COTS) will expedite the distribution to military personnel.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No formal solicitation package is available.  Vendors who believe they have this capability should respond by 21 March 2005.  The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred in responding to this notice.  Award is anticipated 15 days after publication of this notice.

<DESC>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) intends to award an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract on a sole source basis, per FAR 6.302-1, a base-plus four option year contract to Lockheed Martin Services Inc. (LMSI), Cherry Hill, New Jersey, for continued support as the systems integrator for the operation, maintenance, sustainment, and development of enhancements for the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS).  Technical support includes configuration management, centralized system administration, performance monitoring, network management of DCPDS within the DoD network infrastructure, backup and recovery, software distribution, help desk support, system security, application sustainment and maintenance of the Federal and DoD mandated customizations of the Oracle Human Resources (HR) software, and technology refresh.  Lockheed Martin is integral to the team of Government functional experts and has been the sole provider of systems integration for DCPDS since its transition from Government operations to an outsourced operation in 1999.  DCPDS is the Department of Defense (DoD) highly complex; enterprise automated civilian Human Resources (HR) information management and transaction processing system that supports the Departmentâ€™s more than 800,000 civilian employee records and 1.5 million position records.  The Military Services and Defense Agencies, as well as two non-DoD agencies (Executive Office of the President and the International Broadcasting Bureau/Broadcasting Board of Governors), comprise the DCPDS customer base.  The Civilian Personnel Management Service (CPMS) developed DCPDS as the Department-wide automated civilian HR information system and, with the technical support of Lockheed Martin, deployed it fully by September 2002, replacing numerous DoD civilian HR systems with one enterprise, multiple-interfaced system.  Lockheed Martin led the technical team that web-enabled DCPDS in 2003.  DCPDS is the largest automated HR management system in the world, encompassing appropriated and non-appropriated fund, local national, and National Guard civilian employees; over 500,000 business rules; and operating with 490 tables containing over 5,000 data elements.  DCPDS is capable of processing 1.75 million pay and benefit transaction combinations and fully interfaces with multiple payroll offices.  DCPDS provides state-of-the-art information technology that increases the speed and accuracy of personnel transaction processing and provides management information to every level of the Department, down to the supervisorâ€™s desktop computer.   It is a global system, supporting users in Asia, Pacific, Europe and North America on a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week basis (approximately 15% of users are located in Asia, Pacific, and Europe).   
 
While CPMS owns the data rights to the DCPDS customized software, there are multiple activities, processes, and tools in use to support DCPDS that are proprietary to Lockheed Martin.  Lockheed Martin has taken a proactive approach towards developing processes, tools, and documentation to support DCPDS operations and applying technology refresh initiatives.

In GFY 2005, system preparation began for the development, testing, migration, and operational support to implement the National Security Personnel System (NSPS), in accordance with Section 9902 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for GFY 2004, Public Law 108-136 (November 24, 2003).  The first phase of NSPS is currently scheduled for implementation in July 2005.

The place of performance is San Antonio, Texas, the location of the primary CPMS functional systems team.  This contract will provide for the continuation of the services for operation, maintenance, and sustainment of DCPDS, awarded initially to Lockheed Martin in 1999 under the Defense Logistics Agency DSETS contract, with a follow-on contract awarded to Lockheed on May 10, 2002, under the Information Technology Omnibus Procurement (ITOP) II Task Order.  Continued support will include critical developmental efforts required to enhance DCPDS with the implementation of NSPS.  Lockheed Martin is the incumbent and the only source with the technical capability and established resources for meeting the support requirements within the delivery timeframe.  The transition to this contract must be seamless, since it supports the continuous operation of the large, complex DoD customer base of enterprise-wide HR management; provides the interface with DoD-wide civilian payroll operations; and implements the statutory requirements of the new NSPS.  Based on market research, Lockheed Martin is the only company that has the detailed knowledge and unique qualifications and processes to provide the needed support.    

This effort is anticipated to be awarded under multiple contract types, such as Firm Fixed Price and Cost Plus Fixed Fee.  The solicitation and all related information will be made available through the Governmentwide Point of Entry (GPE) located at www.fedbizopps.gov .  The solicitation will not be available through electronic data interchange.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which shall be considered by DLA.  DLA will use such capability statements in determining whether to continue on a sole source basis or conduct an unrestricted competition for this requirement.  In any event, any responsible source may submit a proposal in response to the solicitation.  Contracting Officer, Loretta C. Buckley, at Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), ATTN:  Loretta C. Buckley (DES-A), 8725 John J. Kingman Road, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060.  Fax (703) 767-1172 or email loretta.buckley@dla.mil by 12:00 pm, EST, March 30, 2005.  No telephone inquiries/responses will be accepted.  See Government-wide numbered note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Any questions regarding this solicitation should be addressed to:  Kevin Mulvihill at Kevin.T.Mulvihill@nws02.usace.army.mil.  The Seattle District Corps of Engineers (SDCOE) has a competitive requirement for a Job Order Contract (JOC) Indefinite Del ivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for a base year and four (4) optional one-year periods with a total capacity of $125 million. This requirement will be a Best Value procurement conducted in accordance with procedures outlined in Federal Acquisitio n Regulations (FAR) Part 15.  The contract will support Public Works (PW) at Fort Lewis and its sub-installations, the 70th Reserve Support Center (RSC) that supports Army Reserve Centers in Washington and Oregon, and the 96th RSC that supports Army Reserv e Centers in Montana and Idaho and on occasion the JOC will be used by the SDCOE Small Projects Team.  The SDCOE Regional JOC will accomplish multi-disciplinary maintenance & repair and minor construction work, with most task orders ranging from $2,000 to $750,000 or in accordance with AFAR Sup 17.9000(a), with a maximum limit not to exceed $2,000,000.00 per task order. The JOC will be an alternative to formal contractual efforts for projects under $2,000,000. The JOC will be used on less complex projects, enabling the Seattle District and Fort Lewis to avoid the separate iterative design and construction solicitation efforts, and result in design cost and manpower savings for these comparatively simple design and low/moderate dollar value projects. Other ta sks to be accomplished under this contract will include emergency work excluding service orders.  The Fort Lewis Public Works will decide on a case-by-case basis which work will be assigned to in-house personnel dependent on urgency, dollar value, and curr ent in-house workload. It is anticipated that work will include some minor road repairs and projects that require open space improvements.  For the purposes of this procurement, a concern is considered a small business if its annual average gross revenue, taken for the last 3 fiscal years, does not exceed $28.5 million. Large businesses will be required to submit a Small and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan with their proposal showing acceptable levels of subcontracting with small, small dis advantaged business (SDB), woman-owned, veteran-owned small business (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), HUBZone small business and HBCU/MI concerns.

Due to the extensive subcontracti ng opportunities available under this contract, subcontracting goals are as follows: Small Business 75%; Small Disadvantaged - 10%; Women-owned - 5%; Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business-5% and HUBZone  3%.  The North American Industry Classific ation System (NAICS) Code is 236220 with size standard of $28.5 Million.

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION FOR Aerospace Organic Matrix Composite Materials.   The objective of this program is to investigate from both an analytical and experimental standpoint the potential of new and/or modifications of existing matrix materials and reinforcement forms, for us in advanced composite materials, including processing/mechanical property relationships.  Examples of relationships of interest include processing, thermal, mechanical property evaluation and environmental degradation.  An additional objective is to provide a mechanism to provide flexible access to technologies to meet current technical needs and provide a fresh technical outlook, and maintain a state-of-the-art capability for related research.  Such materials are subsequent candidates for use in advanced aircraft, missile and space structural applications.  The majority of the technical effort is performed on-site at Wright Patterson Air Force Base.  The anticipated funding for this effort is $20M.  The funding profile listed with this anticipated requirement reflect the estimated requirement funding only.  This estimate is not a promise for funding.  Funding is uncertain and is subject to change.  Changes in availability may occur as a result of the exercise of Government discretion.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to add a proposal preparation checklist.  The checklist is as follows:

A Checklist for BAA 05-09 Proposal Preparation
A.	Explain in detail how your concept scales to 100 kW within the 50 nm bandwidth and the Laser Performance Metric requirements.
B.	Given the historical difficulties of high power coherent beam combining of diode arrays containing tens to hundreds of diodes, please explain what is new in your approach that overcomes the difficulties that plagued these previous experiments.
C.	Provide the best evidence you can that the approach you propose to develop will lead to a Beam Propagation Factor that will meet the Phase 1 requirement of 0.25 and the Phase 2 requirement of 0.5;  these must be separately demonstrated at full power.  (See Program Scope in the BAA.)
D.	Please provide a comprehensive breakout for the individual elements of your projected Laser Performance Metric. 
E.	Please make your defining near-field exit aperture clear.  Please also make clear the outgoing beam fill factor at this exit aperture.  Please include a drawing that also shows the size of the projected far field beam pattern.  
F.	Where possible, please provide experimental evidence to justify important assertions that are made in your proposal.
G.	What efficiency degradation do you expect in going to 865 or 1040 nm diodes from 980 nm?  Ensure that these efficiency degradations are included in your calculations of the LPM.
H.	Please provide a detailed drawing of the 10 kW system and its components. 
I.	Provide a Gantt chart showing tasks and major milestones by month. 
J.	Please provide a task-by-task cost summary by phase and government fiscal year, assuming a start date of Oct 1, 2005.
K.	To minimize the ADHELS program cost, please review your proposal cost to be certain that everything you have proposed is absolutely necessary to accomplish your objectives.
L.	Please include documentation proving your ownership of or possession of appropriate licensing rights to all patented inventions (or inventions for which a patent application has been filed) that will be utilized under your proposal for the DARPA program.  If a patent application has been filed for an invention that your proposal utilizes, but the application has not yet been made publicly available and contains proprietary information, you may provide only the patent number, inventor name(s), assignee names (if any), filing date, filing date of any related provisional application, and a summary of the patent title, together with either:  1) a representation that you own the invention, or 2) proof of possession of appropriate licensing rights in the invention.  Please also provide a good faith representation that you either own or possess appropriate licensing rights to all other intellectual property that will be utilized under your proposal for ADHELS.

<DESC>UPDATE (3-15-05) CLARIFICATIONS TO FIFTH AMENDMENT CHANGES TO PARAGRAPH 7.8.2 – PROPOSAL  SCHEDULE REQUIREMENTS AND TIME EXTENSION FOR CHANGES TO THE OFFERORS’ PROPOSALS  RESULTING FROM FIFTH AMENDMENT CHANGES TO PROPOSAL SCHEDULE REQUIREMENTS Clarification #1: Paragraph 7.8.2 (d) states “Table 7.8.2 (d) provides an example of how the  schedule might be structured in support of this contract.”  Table 7.8.2 (d) is  meant as an example of how a schedule might be structured, and should be  treated as such.   Clarification #2: Fifth Amendment changes to Table 7.8.2 (d) were meant to capture the  Government’s desire to be able to evaluate the offeror’s ability to demonstrate  that they have the capability to produce at the rate of 5 shipsets per month.   For this reason, the Government inserted language to request this sufficient  level of detail (i.e. two, three, and four) for the 16th through the 20th  shipsets, the first five shipsets after low rate initial production.  Unless  directed otherwise by the offeror, the Government would then assume that the  level of detail provided for the production of the 16th through the 20th  shipsets applies to all subsequent shipsets.  The fifth amendment change should  not have placed this information with in Table 7.8.2 (d), rather it should have  appeared in paragraph 7.8.2 (j), as discussed in #3 below. Clarification #3:  As stated above, the fifth amendment changes stated in Table 7.8.2 (d) were  inappropriate as this table was meant as only an example of how a schedule  might be structured.  The changes should have also been included in paragraph  7.8.2 (j), which specifies an actual requirement.  However, the intent of the  changes should be clear from the changes enacted, and therefore, the Government  does not believe an additional amendment is necessary at this time.   The due date and time for all fifth amendment changes pertaining to Volume 6  Proposal Schedule ONLY is hereby extended to no later than 12:00 pm on Friday,  18 March 2005. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one or, preferably, both  of the contractual POC’s listed below.  Please remember to begin any email  subject line with "ESUP". Contractual POC: Sally Meyer, Contracting Officer, sally.meyer@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4304, or Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192 or 937-255-5816, ASC/AE, Bldg. 570, Room 113, 1175 Eleventh  Street, WPAFB, OH 45433-7211 //END OF UPDATE//  UPDATE (3-9-05) CLARIFYING STATEMENTS TO ALL ESUP OFFERORS The following statements are posted to help clarify various aspects of the RFP,  including the fifth amendment, and the evaluation notice process: 1) The fifth amendment’s change to the MPQ does not represent any change to the  Government’s requirement for the flexibility to upgrade the entire fleet of 509  aircraft.  The Government still requires pricing for the entire fleet of 509  aircraft.  The purpose of the MPQ was to provide the offerors with an  opportunity to adjust their prices, if necessary, to accommodate any changes in  the pricing assumptions or any other considerations associated with the MPQ. 2) Change/slip pages should be submitted only for the EN pages in which the  changes are enacted.  A re-submittal of an entire proposal volume is neither  necessary nor desired.  If a change cannot be made within the confines of the  current page(s), it is permissible to add a page numbered as an addendum to the  current page, i.e. page 213 would roll into 213A, 213B, etc.  The remainder of  the numbering in the volume would not be affected, nor would there be any  changes to the subsequent pages due to the addition of new material.   Electronic versions of change/slip pages resulting from an EN should be  submitted individually, i.e. as a file separate from the remainder of the  volume.  3) The page limitations were for the initial submittal of the proposals only.   As we are now in discussion, any changes resulting from evaluation notices will  not be counted against the original page limit.  Any additions to supporting  documentation that are necessary as the result of an evaluation notice are  acceptable.   4) The color of change/slip pages does not necessarily reflect the proposal  volume but the factor category.  The factor title, i.e. Mission Capability,  Contracts, Past Performance, etc., should match the color of the change/slip  pages provided in Amendment 5, regardless of the volume.  For example, Volume 5  may include both Contracting and Mission Capability colored change/slip pages. 5) Unless otherwise notified by the Government, the offeror’s response to the  EN will determine whether a narrative and/or change/slip page response is  appropriate.  In the event that the Government requires a specific type of  response, i.e., narrative rather than a change/slip page, the offeror will be  notified accordingly.   6) If a perceived error is found within an evaluation notice, the offeror may  correct the error and annotate the correction as such.  If the error impairs  the offeror’s ability to respond, the offeror should notify the PCO immediately  so that the error may be addressed. //END OF UPDATE//   UPDATE (3-1-05) FIFTH AMENDMENT TO T-38C ESUP RFP POSTED Changes to the T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program Final RFP have been posted  as Amendment 5.

No time extension is anticipated as a result of these  changes.  The following is a summary of the major changes: The following sentences were added to Section L, Paragraph 3.3.3 (a) and are  written in pink to distinguish them from previous amendments:  "The offeror may  provide a seat-cover to protect the identity of their seat.  Seats must not  include any visible markings/decals/data plates identifying its manufacturer;  these markings must be removed or covered prior to delivery." The following sentence was added to Pricing Exhibit PA: "The Government  anticipates a delivery date of 9 MARO for the Integration Testing Shipsets." Lastly, although it is not an amendment, the  ESUP_Model_Contract_Clauses_Changed.doc document has been corrected to more  accurately reflect the clauses that were changed.  Please note, this document  was provided for informational purposes only in an attempt to assist the  offerors.  In the event of a discrepancy between supporting documentation such  as this listing and the RFP, the RFP takes precedence.  The corrected document  has been reposted.   If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one or, preferably, both  of the contractual POC+s listed below.  Please remember to begin any email  subject line with "ESUP". Contractual POC: Sally Meyer, Contracting Officer, sally.meyer@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4304, or Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (1-13-05) THIRD AMENDMENT TO ESUP FINAL RFP POSTED Changes to the T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program Final RFP have been posted  as Amendment 3.  The following is a summary of the major changes: 1)  Section K, AFMC 5352.215-9007 USE OF NON-GOVERNMENT ADVISORS (AFMC) (NOV  1998), the following list of firms supplying non-government advisors was added  to the clause: Anteon International Corporation ARINC Incorporated Camber Corporation General Dynamics Corporation MTC Technologies Sumaria Systems, Inc. 2)  Several changes were made to Section L.  Passages in green type represent  third amendment changes.  Red type still represents first amendment changes,  and blue type still represents second amendment changes.  Offerors should not  rely only upon the color coding system to identify changes;  all offerors are  responsible for adhering to all instructions provided in the original RFP and  all amendments.   The major changes to Section L are as follows: 1)  References to a "C" type contract with options were replaced with  appropriate IDIQ language.   2)  Additional instructions for the cross-reference matrices are provided in  Paragraph 2.1.5.8.   3)  Additional information regarding the packing procedure is provided under  Paragraph 3.3.1 (b) (6). 4)  It became apparent that it would be impractical to draw numbers at the time  of proposal receipt. Therefore, in the paragraph 3.3.3 (e), the following  sentence, "Offerors will draw a number at delivery of the proposal to determine  the sequence of the evaluation." is replaced with "Through random selection,  the Government will determine the order in which the seats will be evaluated.   Offerors will be provided an approximate date for the beginning of their seat  evaluation via email once Volume II - Past Performance of their proposal is  received."   5)  The following passage was added to paragraph 2.1.5.4 (g), "This restriction  does not apply to PDF files submitted for the Pedigree documentation.  For the  Pedigree documentation, PDF files with textual search and copy functions shall  be submitted to the maximum extent practicable.  However, in situations where  submitting an "image" is the only option available, it is acceptable to do  so."   If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one or, preferably, both  of the contractual POC+s listed below.  Please remember to begin any email  subject line with "ESUP". Contractual POC: Sally Meyer, Contracting Officer, sally.meyer@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4304, or Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //END OF UPDATE// Update (1-11-05) CONTRACT TYPE CHANGED TO IDIQ ON-LINE CERTIFICATIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS APPLICATION (ORCA) REQUIREMENT ADDED CLARIFICATION REGARDING PAST PERFORMANCE The Government has amended the RFP to change the contract type from a "C" type  contract to an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract.   As these changes are essentially a restructuring of the pricing tables from  within the H clauses to Pricing Exhibits and a change in ordering procedures,  no RFP schedule changes are being made.  These changes are hereby posted as the  second amendment to the RFP.  In addition, the Government has enacted a few  other changes in order to comply with the new ORCA requirement that became  effective on 1 Jan 2005.   As a result, the following documents have been changed: 1)  The model contract 2)  Section K, Certifications and Representations 2)  Section L   The changes in the clauses in the model contract are listed in these two  documents, ESUP_Previous_Section_H_vs_Pricing_Exhibits.doc and  ESUP_Model_Contract_Clauses_Changed.doc.  Several exhibits, e.g. PA-PQ, have  been created to replace the majority of the H clauses, and are included in  the .pdf version of the model contract.  In addition, MS Excel versions of  the documents have been posted on PIXS in .zip file,  ESUP_IDIQ_Pricing_Exhibits.zip.  If you are unable to access the Excel files,  please contact one of the contractual POC+s listed below for assistance.     Offerors are asked to utilize the new tabular format for the pricing.  The  tables may need to be adjusted, changed to landscape mode, etc. to accommodate  your dollar values.  This is a perfectly acceptable approach.   The DD Form  1423+s, Exhibit A, include the changes from Amendment 1. Exhibit B is the list  of support equipment that originally appeared in SCR H-118.  The Statement of  Objectives, Attachment 1, has not been changed, but is serving as a placeholder  for the contractor proposed Statement of Work. A paragraph with information regarding ORCA has also been posted as  ORCA_Information.doc.  The clause added to Section K can be found within that  section and is referenced in the ESUP_Model_Contract_Clauses_Changed.doc  document. Section L has been posted in its entirety with all the Amendment 1 and  Amendment 2 changes incorporated.  Amendment 1 changes are in red; Amendment 2  changes are in blue.   Due to an ambiguity in the RFP regarding the Past Performance Questionnaires,  the Government would like to highlight a couple key passages from the original  RFP, and two key changes to the RFP document.   In paragraph 4.1.1 (b) (6),  Section L of the RFP states "All Past Performance Questionnaire Tracking  Records shall be submitted with the offeror+s proposal as an addendum to Volume  II.  This exchange/contact between the offeror and its POCs shall cease upon  submission of the offeror’s proposal to the Government in response to this  RFP."  In Attachment 4 to Section L, it states, "We are seeking at least two  POC’s, per relevant contract, to submit a completed Present/Past Performance  Questionnaire directly to the Government no later than [OFFEROR FILL-IN RFP  CLOSING DATE (30th calendar day after RFP release)]."  Because these statements  do not provide a clear and unequivocal cutoff date for receipt of the Past  Performance questionnaires, the Government has amended these passages to remove  the ambiguities/discrepancies.  The due date for Past Performance  questionnaires is the RFP closing date of 31 Jan 2005 at 12:00 pm EST.  In  addition, the phone and fax numbers associated with submittal of these  documents has been changed to reflect the current location of the Government  POC.  Offerors may need to contact their potential  respondents to ensure that  the respondents have the correct phone and fax numbers.  Also, as was  previously mentioned, a list identifying respondents to Past Performance  Questionnaires will be provided to each respective offeror in the near future  to aid in your tracking of these responses.         If you have any questions or concerns regarding this amendment or any aspect of  the ESUP program, please contact one or both of the contractual POC+s listed  below.  Please remember to begin any email subject line with "ESUP".

This will enable the Government to provide  timely feedback regarding any questions about receipt of these questionnaires  and will help us to provide a tally of the received questionnaires.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions, provide clarification on some points, and to amend the evaluation so that multiple awards may be made. The following questions were received regarding the solicitation.  Answers are provided following each question: 1. We understand that there will be both a court reporter present and audiotaping of the proceedings. Is a transcript required to be produced of every proceeding, or only those that are appealed?  A transcript is produced for all proceedings that require a court reporter present.  Some transcripts are verbatim and some are summarized, but they are always required when the accused is found guilty.  If the case results in an acquittal, no transcript is required.   2. If a transcript is produced, is it produced by the court reporter or by some other means with the audiotapes?   Typically, we use in house court reporters and send the audiotapes out for transcription.     3. If a transcript is produced, what is the turnaround time for delivery to you? Are there occasions when transcripts will need to be expedited?   The turn around time should typically be 2 weeks, but we will give the contractor 4 weeks for larger records.  On a rare occasion we might ask for an expedited transcript.   Reference statement of work. 4. Can I make a proposal for transcription work only since I am located outside of California?   Yes.  We can and do send transcripts out of the state to be transcribed, but there might be a few occasions where we will need a contractor to act as court reporter in the courtroom in San Diego. The following are additional clarifications: 1.  All travel costs are to be paid by the contractor. 2.  Pricing for transcription:  Offerors can submit one price for transcription services with a normal turn around time and another price for transcription services with a fast turn around time.  Section B is amended to reflect this pricing.  Reference statement of work for turn around times. FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation is amended to change the last sentence in the paragraph and add the following: Award will be made to those responsible offerors who meet the above minimum requirements, demonstrate acceptable past performance and offer the lowest price.      Multiple awards:  The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offerors whose offers conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Award will be made by Contract Line Items Numbers (CLINS).  Award will be made to that offeror providing the best value on CLINS 1 and 2 (for transcription services).  Award will be made to that offeror providing the best value on CLIN 3 (court reporting services).  The Government reserves the right to make a single award for CLINS 1, 2, and 3 if the awardee offers the best value for each of the services.

<DESC>This amendment is hereby issued to correct the Response Due Date in the description block to read March 17, 2005 instead of March 15, 2005.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged. 

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to procure services of a contractor to provide accurate, comprehensive, real-time "commercial" real estate market data, hereafter, “market data” for approximately eight (8) concurrent users located nationally, with the potential to add up to 13 additional users throughout the term of the contract. IRS seeks access via a web-based service database to market data for all major U.S. metropolitan markets and their submarkets.  Additionally, the IRS manages a proprietary location modeling tool that determines the optimal location of IRS facilities by zip code designation.  The location modeling tool utilizes Geographic Information System technology and the market data output from the procured web-based service shall be easily transferred to the location model.  The web-based service shall allow the IRS to search for available commercial building inventory by zip code.  Further, property searches must be conducted in the web-based service database by overlaying a set of boundaries onto a map or aerial image in the web-based service database which will then provide available commercial building inventory within that delineated area.  Additionally, the web-based service shall allow IRS employees to analyze current and historical market conditions; verify building specific lease terms and conditions, i.e., asking rent rates, building vacancy rates, available square footage by floor, building class, up-to-date subject building transactions; building specific images (floor plans, and exterior and interior building photos); and new construction information.  The information presented shall be timely.  Real-time data is essential.  Also, there shall be a minimum of one (1) day of on-site training to ensure IRS users' understand the web-based product's capability.  On-going customer support for the term of the contract is also required to answer questions/troubleshoot, and to notify IRS of all system upgrades and new market data.  This shall be achieved via on-line demonstrations or contractor staffed call sites.  This customer service shall be available to the IRS Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. EST.  The Period of Performance is one year from date of award. Responsible parties that can provide the above requirement shall submit a written quotation of interest and capability by 12:00 noon EST on the date specified (March 15, 2005). Evaluation/award will be based on the contractor representing the best value to the Government, and cost.  Best value will be demonstrated first and foremost by technically meeting the aforementioned requirements and then cost.  All quotes shall include point of contact (name and telephone number), GSA Contract Number, if applicable, business size, and payment terms.  All questions shall be submitted in writing.  Responses will be accepted by facsimile at (202) 283-1533.  Facsimile responses must contain signatures, arrive at the place and by the time specified in the synopsis and may not exceed 10 pages.  The Government will not be responsible for any failure attributable to the transmission or receipt of any facsimile information.  No solicitation will be issued; therefore, such request for solicitation will be considered non-responsive.

<DESC>The Government is seeking to procure a new JTT-IBS 4-channel receive/1- or 2-channel transmit (4/1 or 4/2) variant that can support the current Integrated Broadcast Service  Interactive (IBS-I), and Integrated Broadcast Service  Simplex (IBS-S) int elligence networks to fill a critical need for more IBS capable-terminals in the near-term until Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) is available to replace all legacy IBS terminals in the field. In addition, the new JTT-IBS must support integration of the Common Integrated Broadcast (CIB) waveform, Common Message Format (CMF) parser, Software Communications Architecture (SCA) core framework architecture, and a fully programmable COMSEC device to satisfy objective IBS transformation requirements. The Governm ent is planning to procure the JTT-IBS under an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) production contract with delivery of terminals in 9 months for independent government testing, host platforms integration and fielding. Mo netary incentive will be given for accelerated delivery of the initial ten (10) baseline configuration terminals. This production contract is for the minimum procurement of sixty (60) terminals and additional purchase of up to 500 terminals for the total c ontract. The contract will be structured so that a baseline configuration JTT-IBS shall meet the baseline configuration requirements as specified in the Technical Requirements Document (TRD). Upgrade kits will be developed in parallel with the development of the final configuration which will subsequently bring all baseline configuration systems to a uniform final configuration system to support objective IBS requirements as specified in the TRD. The contract will also have a Time and Material (T&M) portion  for additional support specified in the Statement of Work (SOW). Technical questions and responses should be addressed to: Mr. Hung Le, PM CGS/Datalinks SFAE-IEWS-DCGS-A, Bldg. 550, Saltzman Avenue, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5304.

<DESC>The Government is seeking to procure a new JTT-IBS 4-channel receive/1- or 2-channel transmit (4/1 or 4/2) variant that can support the current Integrated Broadcast Service  Interactive (IBS-I), and Integrated Broadcast Service  Simplex (IBS-S) int elligence networks to fill a critical need for more IBS capable-terminals in the near-term until Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) is available to replace all legacy IBS terminals in the field. In addition, the new JTT-IBS must support integration of the Common Integrated Broadcast (CIB) waveform, Common Message Format (CMF) parser, Software Communications Architecture (SCA) core framework architecture, and a fully programmable COMSEC device to satisfy objective IBS transformation requirements. The Governm ent is planning to procure the JTT-IBS under an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) production contract with delivery of terminals in 9 months for independent government testing, host platforms integration and fielding. Mo netary incentive will be given for accelerated delivery of the initial ten (10) baseline configuration terminals. This production contract is for the minimum procurement of sixty (60) terminals and additional purchase of up to 500 terminals for the total c ontract. The contract will be structured so that a baseline configuration JTT-IBS shall meet the baseline configuration requirements as specified in the Technical Requirements Document (TRD). Upgrade kits will be developed in parallel with the development of the final configuration which will subsequently bring all baseline configuration systems to a uniform final configuration system to support objective IBS requirements as specified in the TRD. The contract will also have a Time and Material (T&M) portion  for additional support specified in the Statement of Work (SOW). Technical questions and responses should be addressed to: Mr. Hung Le, PM CGS/Datalinks SFAE-IEWS-DCGS-A, Bldg. 550, Saltzman Avenue, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5304.

<DESC>Solicitation Number: W912PL-05-R-0004 Title:  Main Base Runway Replacement Location:  Edwards AFB, CA Price Range:  $25,000,000 - $100,000,000 Media:  Web The project is located on an airfieldaccess is controlled and airfield requirement will be in effect.  This project is a Best Value, two-phase design-build solicitation. The detailed project performance requirements for this project will be included in th e Requests for Proposals (RFP) package (phase-two).  The solicitation criteria relies upon industry standards, where allowable, to afford the offeror a degree on design flexibility while meeting certain specific project requirements.  The successful Contra ctor must design and construct complete and useable facilities, as described in the RFP documents.    One solicitation will be issued covering both phases. Phase I is the pre-selection phase (this phase does not include the submission of a price proposal).   Proposals will be evaluated in Phase One to determine which offerors will submit proposals for Phase Two and an amendment will be issued to those selected offerors (minimum of three, maximum of five).  Selection of offerors for involvement in Phase two w ill be based on technical approach and performance capability.  Detailed project design requirements will then be added by amendment to the solicitation at the start of Phase Two of the Request for Proposals.  A maximum of five offerors will be invited to participate in the second phase.  Phase 2 proposal ratings will be used to determine the most advantageous proposal to the Government.  Award of the Design-Build contract will be made to one of the five firms, which, in the judgment of the Contracting Offi cer, provides the best combination of design features and cost/price reasonableness.  In making this determination, all evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are of equal importance.  The Government reserves the right to make award to o ther than the lowest price offeror, price and other factors considered. PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  This project is to construct a temporary 220 ft x 12000 ft asphalt runway with associated taxiway connectors 2,500 feet from the existing main runway; to demolish the existing main runway at Edwards Air Force Base, California and to c onstruct a new 300 ft x 15,000 ft concrete runway.  Both runways must be capable of supporting large aircraft, including the B-2, B-52 and 747.  New temporary runway: 260,00 SM = 2,800,000 SF; Replace existing runway: 390,335 SM = 4,200,000 SF. REQUIREMENT:  Edwards Air Force Base requires a runway that can safely support a wide range of aircraft test operations, including launch and recovery of prototype aircraft, heavy aircraft operations to include the B-1, B-2, B-52, KC-135, 747, and various forms of failure testing as well as recovery and transport of the NASA Space Shuttle.  Construction of a temporary runway is needed to allow transfer of all flight operations from the existing runway during construction. Missions that require a 15,000 ft r unway include refused take-off testing of heavy aircraft, wet brake testing of heavy aircraft, hot weather operations of specific aircraft such as the T-38, and recovery of the NASA Space Shuttle. CURRENT SITUATION:  The main base runway which supports almost every flight operation at Edwards Air Force Base is nearly 50 years old an is rapidly degrading as a result of alkali-silica reaction (ASR), a reaction between the cement and the aggregate that  creates cracking, scaling and spalling of the concrete.  Increased sweeper operations and Foreign Object Debris (FOD) walks are necessary to eliminate concrete chunks several inches across that are routinely discovered.  Emergency FOD repairs have forced runway closures affecting 10 to 15 flights for each closure.  Pavement Conditions Index (PCI) numbers are dropping rapidly, which is indicative of pavements nearing the end of their useful life.   The runway will soon fail functionally a nd will no longer be safe for aircraft operations.  In early FY03 the runway was evaluated by a tri-service team of experts who rated the pavement conditions along with the centerline as MARGINAL, with potions predicted to be UNSATISFACTORY within the next  year.  Functional failure of the runway is expected in 2008.  No other runways at Edwards AFB can safely support the current and projected test operations without significant test mission delays.  Temporary relocation of these missions is not feasible.  H owever, many of the current and planned test missions can be supported by a new temporary runway. The estimated cost of this project is from $75,000,000  $125,000,000.  Phase I evaluations may be based on the contractors past performance, to include the design firm; contractors organization; contractors specialized experience on similar type work; contractors capability, to include key personnel qualifications and experience; past performance on utilization of Small Business Concerns; preliminary quality control plans and safety program; a narrative addressing the technical approach; and a narrativ e addressing the process approach.  Phase II evaluations are anticipated to be based on, but may not be limited to, such items as pavement design; narrative/technical solutions, to include disciplines such as civil, pavement engineering, structural, electr ical; to include innovation and efficiency; proposed management plan; proposed quality control plan for design and construction; a preliminary schedule; and phasing approach.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237310, Highway, Street and Bridge Construction, $28,500,000 average annual gross revenue for the last three (3) fiscal years.    The Government intends to issue this solicitation through the use of the Internet.  Amendments to this solicitation will be issued as Internet only.  No additional media (Compact Disks, Floppy Disks, Facsimile or Paper) will be provided unless the Governme nt determines that it is necessary.  It is therefore the contractors responsibility to check the following address daily for any posted changes to this solicitation.  Contractors may view and/or download this solicitation and all amendments from the Inter net after solicitation issuance are the following Internet address; http://ebs.spl.usace.army.mil.  All bidders are required to check the Los Angeles District Contracting Division website daily to be notified on any changes to this solicitation.  All contr actors are encouraged to visit the Armys Single Face to Industry website at http://acquisition.army.mil to view other business opportunities across the Army.  Bidders must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), in order to receive a  Government contract award.  To register, the CCR Internet address is: www.ccr.gov.   Any prospective bidder interested in bidding on this solicitation must be registered to be placed on the Plan Holders List.  If you are not registered, the United States  Government is not responsible for providing you with notification of any changes to this solicitation.  Bidders shall register themselves on the Internet.  Each bidder, after registering for this solicitation should verify that his or her name appears on the Plan Holders List for the project.  Please note that there are special instructions pertaining to hand delivered bids.  These special instructions will be available in Section 00100 of the advertised solicitation. Sub-contracting plans are required for all construction contracts awarded to a large business when the award amount exceeds $1,000,000.00.  If the bidder is a large business, they will be required to submit a sub-contracting plan as part of their proposal package.  The Los Angeles District subcontracting goals are specific percentages of the contractors total planned subcontract amount.  The goals are as follows: 62% with small business, 10% with small disadvantaged business, 10 % with woman owned small business, 3% with veteran owned small business, 3% with severe disabled veteran owned small business and 3% with hub zone small business.  All interested contractors are reminded that the successful contractor will be expected to p lace subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and disadvantaged firms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507.

A maximum of five offerors will be invited to participate in the second phase.  Phase 2 proposal ratings will be used to determine the most advantageous proposal to the Government.  Award of the Design-Build contract will be made to one of the five firms, which, in the judgment of the Contracting Offi cer, provides the best combination of design features and cost/price reasonableness.  In making this determination, all evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are of equal importance.  The Government reserves the right to make award to o ther than the lowest price offeror, price and other factors considered. PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  This project is to construct a temporary 220 ft x 12000 ft asphalt runway with associated taxiway connectors 2,500 feet from the existing main runway; to demolish the existing main runway at Edwards Air Force Base, California and to c onstruct a new 300 ft x 15,000 ft concrete runway.  Both runways must be capable of supporting large aircraft, including the B-2, B-52 and 747.  New temporary runway: 260,00 SM = 2,800,000 SF; Replace existing runway: 390,335 SM = 4,200,000 SF. REQUIREMENT:  Edwards Air Force Base requires a runway that can safely support a wide range of aircraft test operations, including launch and recovery of prototype aircraft, heavy aircraft operations to include the B-1, B-2, B-52, KC-135, 747, and various forms of failure testing as well as recovery and transport of the NASA Space Shuttle.  Construction of a temporary runway is needed to allow transfer of all flight operations from the existing runway during construction. Missions that require a 15,000 ft r unway include refused take-off testing of heavy aircraft, wet brake testing of heavy aircraft, hot weather operations of specific aircraft such as the T-38, and recovery of the NASA Space Shuttle. CURRENT SITUATION:  The main base runway which supports almost every flight operation at Edwards Air Force Base is nearly 50 years old an is rapidly degrading as a result of alkali-silica reaction (ASR), a reaction between the cement and the aggregate that  creates cracking, scaling and spalling of the concrete.  Increased sweeper operations and Foreign Object Debris (FOD) walks are necessary to eliminate concrete chunks several inches across that are routinely discovered.  Emergency FOD repairs have forced runway closures affecting 10 to 15 flights for each closure.  Pavement Conditions Index (PCI) numbers are dropping rapidly, which is indicative of pavements nearing the end of their useful life.   The runway will soon fail functionally a nd will no longer be safe for aircraft operations.  In early FY03 the runway was evaluated by a tri-service team of experts who rated the pavement conditions along with the centerline as MARGINAL, with potions predicted to be UNSATISFACTORY within the next  year.  Functional failure of the runway is expected in 2008.  No other runways at Edwards AFB can safely support the current and projected test operations without significant test mission delays.  Temporary relocation of these missions is not feasible.  H owever, many of the current and planned test missions can be supported by a new temporary runway. The estimated cost of this project is from $75,000,000  $125,000,000.  Phase I evaluations may be based on the contractors past performance, to include the design firm; contractors organization; contractors specialized experience on similar type work; contractors capability, to include key personnel qualifications and experience; past performance on utilization of Small Business Concerns; preliminary quality control plans and safety program; a narrative addressing the technical approach; and a narrativ e addressing the process approach.  Phase II evaluations are anticipated to be based on, but may not be limited to, such items as pavement design; narrative/technical solutions, to include disciplines such as civil, pavement engineering, structural, electr ical; to include innovation and efficiency; proposed management plan; proposed quality control plan for design and construction; a preliminary schedule; and phasing approach.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237310, Highway, Street and Bridge Construction, $28,500,000 average annual gross revenue for the last three (3) fiscal years.    The Government intends to issue this solicitation through the use of the Internet.  Amendments to this solicitation will be issued as Internet only.  No additional media (Compact Disks, Floppy Disks, Facsimile or Paper) will be provided unless the Governme nt determines that it is necessary.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (Large Business, HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, and Small Disadvantage Business) relative to the NAICS Codes. 

This project will survey a national sample of academic institutions to produce a preliminary picture of how the impact of culture, race, ethnicity, and geography on mental health, mental illnesses, and emotional disturbances is being addressed in behavioral health care education and training programs. Programs surveyed will be selected to represent a balance of professional disciplines, geographic locations, ranking, size and type of institution. The contractor will identify key dimensions related to eliminating disparities and cultural competence for training programs from the core behavioral health disciplines (i.e., psychiatry, psychology, psychiatric nursing, and social work) and, to a lesser extent, related behavioral health disciplines (e.g., substance abuse counselors or marriage and family therapists).  Using these dimensions, the contractor will design and conduct a national evaluation of cultural competence in behavioral healthcare education and training programs. 
 As demonstrated above SAMHSA is committed to assuring that mental health and substance abuse services effectively meet the critical needs of the Nation’s diverse population. For example, SAMHSA’s Minority Fellowship Program has two purposes:  to facilitate the entry of ethnic minority students into mental health careers and to increase the number of psychologists, psychiatric nurses, psychiatrists, and social workers trained to teach, administer, and provide direct mental health and substance abuse services to ethnic minority groups.    
In response to the recommendations of the President’s Commission and the Annapolis Coalition, SAMHSA has committed to initiating a project to survey a national sample of academic institutions and produce a preliminary picture of how the impact of culture, race, ethnicity, and geography on mental health, mental illnesses, and emotional disturbances is being addressed in behavioral health care education and training programs. The anticipated data collection efforts will be provided by surveys and/ or interviews of a diverse group of representatives from academic programs in a variety of institutions. The knowledge obtained from this study will contribute to CMHS’s goal of transforming the mental health system by eliminating disparities in mental health services.  

Your responses to the questions provided below will assist the Government in selecting the appropriate acquisition method. Page limit: Maximum 11 pages (font size 10 or larger).     In addition, a copy of the company capability statement will be accepted. Responses are due 15 days from the issue date of this announcement. The anticipated period of performance is 24 months. After review of the responses received, a solicitation may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities on or about April 15, 2005.     
Response to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS), and must respond to the following questions: 
1.       Is your business a small business under the NAICS code? 
2.       Does your firm qualify as a small disadvantaged business? 
3.       If disadvantaged, specify if your firm is certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? 
4.       Are you considered a certified HUBZone firm? 
5.       Are you considered woman-owned or operated business? 
6.       Are you a certified Service-Disabled Veteran Owned or Veteran Owned? 
7.       Is your business a large business? 
8.       Describe your proven capability, national experience and organizational capacity to understand the need for and purpose of the project, including the mission, goals and objectives of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) and its programs, and the President’s New Freedom Initiative Report, and, in particular, the relationship of cultural competence and eliminating disparities to the transformation of the nation’s mental health system.  
9.       Describe your proven capability and current in-house capacity to reflect an understanding of the complex issues of addressing the behavioral work force issue from the perspective of increasing the numbers of culturally sensitive providers as well as developing knowledge, skills and abilities of cultural competence.
10.     Describe your organization’s experience in logistical and administrative support services, to make cost effective travel and lodging arrangements, organize staff meetings, and manage the process of reimbursing expenses expeditiously.
11.       Describe your proven capability and organizational capacity to coordinate and track concurrent activities, as well as show flexibility to adjust plans as necessary. 
12.       Describe your proven capability and current in-house capacity to provide personnel qualified to perform duties such as those needed to accomplish tasks and achieve goals of the project, and possessing the range of skills, including national recognition as leaders and/or experts in the areas (such as cultural competency, mental health disparities, behavioral healthcare education and training) that are required for this project. 
13.	Describe your organization’s capacity to provide consultants, consumers and family members who have experience related to issues of culture, race, ethnicity and workforce development issues.
14.

<DESC>The Program Executive Office for Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS) seeks information from industry, academia and laboratories (all referred to herein as the “Vendor”) capable of providing advanced air and missile defense (AMD) concepts in support of the United States Navy (USN).  New AMD threats are projected to proliferate in the 2030-2040 timeframe.  A particular AMD threat of interest is long-range shore-based anti-ship munitions in the form of “brilliant” munitions.  A “brilliant” munition operates autonomously to search, detect, classify identify, select, and engage targets.  “Brilliant” munitions have an additional capability to identify and engage specific classes of targets.  The means of delivery may be howitzer, artillery rocket or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).  A “brilliant” munitions maximum range of 300 kilometers is anticipated.  In addition, approximately 16 “brilliant” munitions may arrive near simultaneously.  It is desired to negate the “brilliant! ” munitions at least 2 kilometers from the ship through a “hard-kill” concept.  To this end, vendors are encouraged to submit any or all of the following information: (1) A whitepaper describing “brilliant” munitions concepts that are judged likely to be mature enough to be developed and deployed in quantity by the 2030-2040 timeframe; (2) A whitepaper describing “brilliant” munitions hard-kill concepts that are judged likely to be mature enough to be developed and deployed in quantity by the 2030-2040 timeframe; (3) A whitepaper describing a notional engagement systems development program including: the time required for concept refinement, technology development, system development and demonstration, and production and deployment in sufficient quantity to constitute a meaningful combat capability; or (4) A whitepaper describing affordability including rough order of magnitude (ROM) development and procurement costs.  The PEO IWS will accept either unclassified or classifie! d responses (up to the SECRET level) to this RFI.  Vendors responding to the RFI shall submit one (1) hard copy and five (5) CD-ROMs.  Responses shall be submitted in Microsoft WORD format only.  There is a total page limitation of 50 pages (including charts and graphs).  Any response to the RFI that is classified (hard copy and CD-ROMs) shall be marked and transmitted in accordance with the DoD 5220.22M NISPOM.  Responses to the RFI are to be submitted to PEO IWS via mail by 30 April 2005 as follows: OUTER ENVELOPE: COMMANDER, NAVAL SEA SYSTEMS COMMAND, PROGRAM EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR INTEGRATED WARFARE SYSTEMS, STANDARD MISSILE OFFICE, ATTN: DESHAUNNE PEGUES (SECURITY OFFICER), 2450 CRYSTAL DRIVE, SUITE 700, ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA 22202-3843.

THIS IS A REQUEST!  FOR INFORMATION ONLY AND NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. The information sought herein is for planning purposes only.  There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of any information submitted in response to this Request for Information (RFI). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise to pay for any information submitted by respondents to this RFI.  If the vendor provides information to the Government that it does not want disclosed to the public, it shall mark the title page with the following legend: “This document includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed – in whole or in part – for any purpose other than to provide information to the Government.  This restriction does not limit the Government’s right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction.

The U.S. Department of Labor’s, Employee Benefits and Security Administration (EBSA) seeks information from existing firms capable of receiving, logging and archiving approximately 1.4 million information Form 5500 Series reports annually.  The information reports, which are the subject of this inquiry, are Annual Form 5500 Series Reports (including Form 5500, Form 5500-EZ, and all schedules and attachments to these forms) required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).  Form 5500 Series reports may contain Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) data and are therefore subject to commensurate security and handling protections.  The average report is approximately 25 pages in length, but a complex return could be tens of thousands of pages and weigh hundreds of pounds.  The total number of pages to be processed is estimated to be approximately 25 million pages per processing year.  The processing year period of performance for this effort is estimated to be July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006, with options for additional processing periods, as needed. EBSA seeks information on firms that are capable of the following functionality: (1) Establishing a Government Post Office Box and retrieving the reports from the Post Office Box at least once daily; (2) Opening filings retrieved and stamping with the date; (3) Recording approximately seven (7) critical "fact-of-filing" tracking fields and an archive box number for each filing in a database log and delivering the database monthly to EBSA; (4) Forwarding remittances erroneously included with reports to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) and maintaining Chain of Custody records, including secure handling, logging, storage, and transmission for the remittances. (5) Maintaining administrative, technical, and physical security for the filings, processing facility, and staff, including supporting Government conduct of a Minimum Background Investigation (MBI) for each assigned staff member; (6) Retrieving and providing copies of filings, as needed, to EBSA within 24 hours of request; (7) Archiving all filings to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), per prevailing NARA labeling, boxing, storage, and shipping procedures at the conclusion of the contract; (8) Safeguarding the filings from environmental damage, loss, commingling, theft, and other hazards at all stages of processing; (9) Supporting Government conduct of periodic processing compliance reviews and security compliance reviews.  EBSA is interested in obtaining information on existing firms with experience in projects that approximate the functionality of the above described ERISA Annual Report processing requirements.  Interested companies are requested to submit a capability statement in Adobe PDF format by E-mail to Thompson.sheila@dol.gov, by March 29, 2005, 2:00 p.m., eastern standard time.  The capability statement shall address the firm’s core competencies and corporate capabilities with regard to the functionality described above, and shall include at least one project description for a similar effort for which the company has direct and relevant experience and which includes contact information for obtaining a reference.  The cover letter must state the number of this market survey RFI DOL and must state whether the respondent is a large, small, 8(a), Veteran-owned or HubZone business concern.  Respondents that are small business must also state if they are woman-owned business.  If a vendor has a GSA schedule contract that can cover these services, please state the GSA Schedule number in your cover letter.  The Government reserves the right to compete any acquisition resulting from this survey among small businesses or to make an award to an 8(a) firm, based on the responses received.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to pay for the information requested, issue a solicitation, or award a contract.  No technical or solicitation documents exist at this time.  All firms/organizations that submit response will be included in the distribution of any subsequent solicitation.

<DESC>The government is contemplating a FIXED PRICE Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite- Quantity (IDIQ) type of contract to fulfill roofing repair requirements at Langley AFB, VA. Historically, this requirement has been unrestricted based on local market conditions and estimated performance requirements. 

This type of contract will be used since exact time and quantity of repairs are not known at the time of award.  The contract will provide a minimum guarantee ($5,000) and roof repairs will be ordered on an as-needed basis up to maximum ceiling over the duration of the contract period.  Ordering of roof repairs after the requirements materialize allows flexibility in both quantities and delivery scheduling.

We are conducting market research to determine capability for competition under the following programs: 8(a) , Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business , and/or Hub Zone participation.  Interested 8 (a) firms must have an office located in the SBA-Mid-Atlantic Region .  All others must have an office within 100 miles of Langley AFB to meet the emergency response requirement.

This roofing requirement is considered a specialized trade requiring firms to be capable of performing at least 25% of the actual roofing work; however, performance capabilities beyond 25% will render greater consideration based on past performance criteria in the upcoming solicitation. 

Interested firms eligible by programs identified above and capable of fulfilling performance and response requirements on an as-needed basis, shall respond to this modified synopsis for consideration. Previous responses will not be considered.  The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 238160.  Respond to the POC below with capabilities statements that include a list of current and previous roofing contracts (within the last three (3) years), their location, magnitude, and points of contact, not later than 22 March 2005. 

All documents associated with this requirement will be posted on the FedBizOpps website www.eps.gov. 

To further assist in maintaining a list of interested offerors for this requirement, please provide your company name, a point of contact, address, phone number, along with your CAGE code, DUNS number, and business size under the above NAICS code to Ms. Betty Sharp, 1 CONS/LGCC, 757-764-7032, betty.sharp@langley.af.mil

<DESC>The Government is seeking to procure a new JTT-IBS 4-channel receive/1- or 2-channel transmit (4/1 or 4/2) variant that can support the current Integrated Broadcast Service  Interactive (IBS-I), and Integrated Broadcast Service  Simplex (IBS-S) int elligence networks to fill a critical need for more IBS capable-terminals in the near-term until Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) is available to replace all legacy IBS terminals in the field.  In addition, the new JTT-IBS must support integration of the  Common Integrated Broadcast (CIB) waveform, Common Message Format (CMF) parser, Software Communications Architecture (SCA) core framework architecture, and a fully programmable COMSEC device to satisfy objective IBS transformation requirements. The Government is planning to procure the JTT-IBS under an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) production contract with delivery of terminals in 9 months for independent government testing, host platforms integration and f ielding.  Monetary incentive will be given for accelerated delivery of the initial ten (10) baseline configuration terminals.  This production contract is for the minimum procurement of sixty (60) terminals and additional purchase of up to 500 terminals fo r the total contract.   The contract will be structured so that a baseline configuration JTT-IBS shall meet the baseline configuration requirements as specified in the Technical Requirements Document (TRD).  Upgrade kits will be developed in parallel with the development of the f inal configuration which will subsequently bring all baseline configuration systems to a uniform final configuration system to support objective IBS requirements as specified in the TRD.  The contract will also have a Time and Material (T&M) portion for ad ditional support specified in the Statement of Work (SOW).   Technical questions and responses should be addressed to: Mr. Hung Le, PM CGS/Datalinks SFAE-IEWS-DCGS-A, Bldg. 550, Saltzman Avenue, Fort Monmouth, NJ  07703-5304.

<DESC>This is not a request for proposal.  This is a request to identify potential sources interested in providing tactical and non-tactical vehicle and machinery maintenance.  The Iraqi Ministry of Defense operates an extensive fleet of tactical and non-tactical vehicles and machinery to support military operations by various segments of the Iraqi Armed Forces (IAF).  The vehicles are normally operated from fixed bases however, as training, exercises or operations dictate, the vehicles maybe operated in austere and remote locations.  The successful contractor will be required to assist the IAF to develop a degree of organizational to intermediate maintenance self sufficiency that is appropriate to both the force requirements and projected in-service period.  The contractor will provide organizational and intermediate maintenance repairs and repair parts support for equipment normally found in Iraqi units including replacement of major assemblies, subassemblies, suspension components, body work, and glass replacement (no frame repairs or cab replacements).   These items will be referred to as military and civilian style trucks as well as specified ground equipment.  Minimum working facilities for the requirement are in place.  The Government is responsible for building/modifying the existing building to accommodate the contractor’s requirements.  The intent is to stand up operations in increments, based on facility improvements by the government.  The initial priority is to provide support to the Iraqi fleet currently located at Al Kasik, KMTB, Tadji, and An Numaniyah.  Expansion is anticipated to eight other locations to support maintenance requirements. Interested sources should e-mail 1Lt William Sahli at William.sahli@pco-iraq.net no later than 4 April 2005.  At this time, Lt Sahli can provide a breakdown of vehicles that are currently in need of repair.  This sources sought notice may be amended at a later date to include additional information.

<SUBJECT>10 -- DRAFT RFP for Scout Sniper Day Scope SSDS
<DESC>This notice is a DRAFT combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items (as defined in Far part 2.1), reference number M67854-05-S-1043, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement is not a solicitation; proposals are NOT being requested at this time.   On behalf of the Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Infantry Weapons Systems (IWS), Optics and Non-Lethal Systems (ONS) this notice requests comments from interested vendors regarding the procurement of the Scout Sniper Day Scope (SSDS) for the M40A3 and M82A3 rifles. The SSDS is being procured utilizing full and open, best value competition.  A separate RFP for a scope mounting system will be issued immediately following award of the SSDS. The Government intends to award two separate contracts: one for the M40A3 SSDS, and another for the M82A3 SSDS; however, in the event a single offeror proposes one scope that meets the requirements of both the M40A3 and the M82A3, a single Offeror may be awarded both contracts (reference Section 3.7.2 of the Purchase Description).  The Government anticipates issuing a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract (DPAS rated DO-A5) to the successful offeror(s) representing the best value to the Government. The provisions at FAR Part 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items apply to this acquisition.  All future information relative to this procurement, including all documentation such as the Purchase Description, Statement of Work (SOW), SSDS Performance Metric Matrix, Past Performance Matrix, and FAR Part 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Template  will be available to industry through the MARCORSYSCOM website: www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil.  Offerors shall submit separate technical and business proposals along with (5) product (bid) samples with their proposal for the M40A3 and (5) product (bid) samples with their proposal for the M82A3 as an element of their offer.  Offerors shall state the price of the bid samples on page 1 of the business volume.  The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with FAR Part 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items as detailed below. Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR Part 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, with their offers. The clause at FAR Part 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.  CLIN STRUCTURE:

The Government intends to utilize the following Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) structure, but actual CLIN structure may vary as a result of the individual selected offeror(s)’ proposal(s). In the event separate contracts are awarded for the M40A3 SSDS and the M82A3 SSDS the below CLIN structure will be altered.  Offerors bidding on only one SSDS should mark “NA” for CLIN 0001 or CLIN 0002, as appropriate for the purpose of this proposal. 
0001 – SSDS, M40A3, includes packaging;
0002 – SSDS, M82A3, includes packaging;
0003 – Miscellaneous Handling and Shipping (Price TBD – may include overseas locations, i.e., Okinawa, Japan);
0004 – Replacement parts;
0004AA, etc. – List applicable replacement parts;
0005 – Training package;
0006 – Contractor level repair;
0006AA – List applicable levels of repair.

The minimum purchase for CLIN 0001 is 600 units.  The maximum purchase for CLIN 0001 is 10,000 units.  The minimum purchase for CLIN 0002 is 100 units.  The maximum purchase for CLIN 0002 is 7,500 units.  The Program Office intends to procure at least the minimum units of CLIN 0001 and 0002; however, additional units may be purchased  as other Government sources show interest.  Minimum and Maximum purchase information for CLINs 0003-0006 will be negotiated with the selected offeror(s).  This contract shall be in effect for five years from the date of award. EVALUATION: The Government intends to complete an initial evaluation based on a review of written proposals and an examination of bid samples.  If the Offeror intends to modify their bid sample (in the event of contract award) to meet the requirements of this solicitation, the offeror must clearly state the intended modifications in the technical volume of their proposal and demonstrate how the stated modifications will meet the Government requirements.  Following the initial evaluation, the Government intends to establish a competitive range, at which time the Government will conduct optical performance tests, environmental tests, and a Limited User Evaluation (LUE) and may hold discussions in accordance with FAR 15.306. The Government will reimburse Offerors, whose proposals are included in the competitive range, for their bid samples.  Bid samples, for Offerors whose proposals are not included in the competitive range, will be returned to the respective Offerors at Government expense in a manner similar to that in which the bid samples were shipped to the Government. In making its “best value” determination, the Government will consider the following non-cost/price factors, in order of importance:  (1) Technical Capability, (2) Integrated Logistics Support, and (3) Past Performance.  The Government will assign an acceptability rating for and assess the risk associated with each factor for every proposal.  In accordance with Section 3.7 of the SSDS Purchase Description, evaluation credit will be given for technical solutions exceeding mandatory minimums.  These factors when combined are significantly more important than price; however, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination increases with the degree of equality in the overall technical merit of the proposals.  As such, price will be evaluated, but not rated.  Technical Volume Content:  
Offerors shall be required to address each requirement listed in the RFP.  Offerors shall show that their product(s) meet all KPPs and provide any data available to substantiate their claims. Offerors shall further submit a Certificate of Compliance with the bid samples, certifying that all requirements have been met (reference Section 4.3.3 of the Purchase Description). Offerors may use product literature in their technical proposals; however, any ambiguities noted in the technical capability of the products may have an adverse impact on proposal evaluation.  The technical volume portion of the proposal shall be specific, detailed, and comprehensive enough to enable technical personnel to make a thorough evaluation of its contents.  All ILS items shall be addressed in the Technical Volume.  Additionally offerors should address any Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) items such as non-warranty repair, training, etc.  

Business Volume Content:
The Business volume shall include a one-page Executive Summary briefly describing the overall technical approach. Offerors shall include: Contractor Name, Address, DUNS, Cage Code, and Tax Identification Number (TIN). Offerors shall be required to provide price information for each of the quantity increments listed below along with a proposed delivery schedule for the first 600 units of CLIN 0001 and the first 100 units of CLIN 0002.  The first 600 items of CLIN 0001 shall be delivered not later than 150 days after receipt of first delivery order.  Delivery Order Increments:1-50, 51-100, 101-200, 201-400, 401-700, 701-1,000.  The unit price of each delivery order will be determined by the number of units ordered on a given delivery order.  Individual orders will be issued using the single price for the increment that corresponds to the total quantity being purchased on that order. Additionally, offerors shall provide price information for replacement parts (lens covers, turrets caps, scope covers, etc) associated with their proposed scope(s).  Offerors shall separately price any proposed Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) items being offered.  The Government reserves the right to purchase all, part, or none of the selected Offeror’s proposed CLS items. All cost and price information shall be rounded to the nearest dollar. Offerors shall include the past performance information detailed below in their Business Volume.  

Past Performance:  
The Government will collect and evaluate past performance information using OSD AT&L, A Guide to Collection and Use of Past Performance Information, Version 3 as a guide. 
Offerors shall provide at least three specific examples of favorable, recent past performance that illustrates evidence of their ability to produce, deliver, and warrant their product.  Offerors shall ensure the past performance information includes names of technical and contracting officials, telephone numbers, addresses, e-mail, name of the product purchased, quantities, dates of the resulting contract, contract value, contract number, and a description of the items procured.  Offerors without at least three specific examples of recent past performance (i.e., a new entrant into the market) will receive a neutral rating in Past Performance.  Offerors shall include past performance in their Business Volume.

<SUBJECT>--SOLICITATION OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS TO EXHIBIT DURING 2005 ANNUAL ITAM WORKSHOP (CONFERENCE), 1-4 AUGUST 2005, IN INDIANAPOLIS, IN.  Seeking commercial firms to exhibit their products and/or services during the four-day 2005 ITAM Workshop.
<DESC>PLEASE CONTACT DR. BERT R. BILES, NILMT ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, AT 785-532-2104 FOR ALL INFORMATION ON THIS EXHIBIT.  DR. BILES' EMAIL ADDRESS IS BRBILES@KSU.EDU. Solicitation of Commercial firms to exhibit during 2005 annual ITAM Workshop (Conference), 1-4 August 2005, in Indianapolis, IN. Sponsors of the 2005 Annual Integrated Training Area Management (ITAM) Workshop are seeking commercial firms to exhibit their products and/or services during the four-day 2005 ITAM Workshop.  This year, the ITAM Workshop will be held at the Indianapolis Co nvention Center, 100 South Capitol Avenue, Indianapolis, IN  46225. The annual ITAM Workshop is the leading national forum for the scientific exchange of technologies, ideas, experiences, and lessons learned that relate to the application of Integrated Training Area Management (ITAM) technologies to the Armys military tra ining lands.  The ITAM Programs at all U.S. Army installations must play a critical role in assuring that military training can be sustained at the highest level for the foreseeable future.  Training activities have increased, and training budgets continue  to expand. Businesses, organizations, companies, and individuals with products and services that relate to land management; land repair and reclamation; wind and soil erosion management; air and water quality issues; forestry and crop land management; GIS program dev elopment and support; road and trail creation and maintenance; environmental and climatological monitoring; unexploded ordnance; and other similar topics will find a ready audience among the ITAM Workshop participants. There will be approximately 500 decision-makers representing government and industry attending the 2005 ITAM Workshop.  It provides a unique opportunity to present and explain commercial products and services that can contribute to sustaining military trai ning and training land rehabilitation and maintenance to the ITAM Coordinators and their staffs.  This is the only all-Army event that brings together the ITAM teams from U.S. Army installations worldwide. Compared to the costs of visiting individual military installations, the ITAM Workshop offers a most cost-effective sales strategy for companies and firms to hold significant face-to-face conversations with ITAM Coordinators and their staffs. The 2005 ITAM Workshop will focus on operations and environmental programs for sustaining military training lands and maintaining Army readiness.  In addition to the main program of technical presentations at the Workshop, there will be several specialized  sessions, including a Geographic Information System (GIS) Workshop, a Range Training Lands Program (RTLP) session, a Range and Training Land Analysis (RTLA) Workshop, and individual Major Army Command (MACOM) meetings.    The 2005 ITAM Workshop is being hosted by Camp Atterbury, Edinburgh, IN; the ITAM Installation Steering Committee; and the Army Training and Support Center.   The commercial exhibits will be located in Exhibit Hall E of the Indiana Convention Center (ICC) Monday through Wednesday of the Workshop, 1-3 August, 2005.  In addition, commercial exhibitors may elect to display and demonstrate equipment at Camp Atterbur y on Thursday, 4 August.  Commercial exhibitors may elect to display their products and services just in ICC Exhibit Hall E Monday through Wednesday, just at Camp Atterbury on Thursday, or at both venues.   During the ITAM Workshop, the Morning Breaks, the AM Breaks, and the PM Breaks all will be held in the Food Court adjacent to the commercial exhibit area in ICC Exhibit Hall E.  No program activities or breakout sessions will be scheduled for 30 minutes af ter each AM or PM Break begins on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Tuesday evening, a free, two-hour No-host Social for all participants will be held adjacent to the commercial exhibits in ICC Exhibit Hall E.   Commercial exhibitors are cordially invited to participate in all open sessions, tou rs, and social events associated with the 2005 ITAM Workshop. For those commercial exhibitors who are interested, plans are being made to provide extensive support of commercial equipment demonstrations and displays at Camp Atterbury on Thursday, 4 August 2005.  Due to current security concerns, these commercial exhi bits will be approved on a first-come/first-served, case-by-case basis.   All commercial exhibit arrangements will be made through the National Institute for Land Management and Training (NILMT) at Kansas State University, the conference support contractor.  To obtain an application to exhibit during the 2005 ITAM Workshop or to  secure further information, commercial exhibitors may contact Dr. Bert R. Biles, NILMT Associate Director, at 785.532.2104.  Dr. Biles e-mail address is:  brbiles@ksu.edu.   Individuals interested in further information concerning the ITAM program, or in attending the 2005 ITAM Workshop, may find program descriptions and/or register online at:  http://srp.army.mil/public/home.aspx  or register by calling the Kansas State Unive rsity Division of Continuing Learning Registration Desk at 785.532.5569.

Project Description: Mission Ridge Road provides recreational access to the Wenatchee National Forest and residential access to a local subdivision.  The road during the ski season has as many as 1500 vehicles per day.  The existing roadway width ranges from 22' to 32' in width.  The road would be widened, drainage structures added, replaced or repaired, guardrail would be added, slow-moving vehicle lanes evaluated and cut and fill slopes would be stabilized.  
The design speed for the proposed road would be 35 miles per hour, but the majority of the curves would remain as originally constructed. The preferred alternative for this project basically follows the existing alignment.  Approximately 50% of the curves have a design speed of less than 35 mph, but additional safety measures would be included to improve the design over the existing conditions.
The purpose of the project is to improve the safety of the roadway, provide snow storage for winter plowing operations and improve the roadway for future maintenance operations.  Approximately eight crashes per year are reported, and recently there have been fatalities on the road.
The road currently climbs a series of switchback curves and is narrow with steep side slopes in many locations.  Many of these steep side slopes are not currently protected by guardrail.
Under the preferred alternative, the road would be reconstructed to a width of 28 feet and partially realigned to achieve more of the AASHTO minimum safety standards for rural collectors in mountainous terrain.  The desired design speed can be achieved on approximately 50 % of the roadway; however, appropriate design speed cannot be achieved on the remaining curves due to the steep existing grades (7 % average), cost, and physical and environmental constraints (stream crossings, switchback type curves, wetlands, and wildlife habitat).  Some of the substandard curves cannot feasibly be straightened because the resulting roadway segment would have grades that exceed the AASHTO-recommended maximum of 12 %.  Some would not be corrected because of the exorbitant cost of moving massive quantities of earth and rock and/or disturbing habitat, such as streams and also due to potential impacts to local landowners.
All minor culverts would be replaced for this alternative.  The culvert at Squilchuck Creek would be retrofit to better accommodate potential fish passage and the culverts at Miners Run Creek would also be retrofit if fish passage is necessary.  As part of the culvert improvements, some of the slopes at the stream crossing would be flattened and drainage flowing into the streams would be controlled to minimize erosion and the amount of sediment flowing into the stream.
For the purpose of discussion, the project corridor is divided into the two segments.  One segment is restricted by homes adjacent to the roadway and the other segment is restricted by private landowners, in addition to environmental concerns.  The segments are as follows:
·	Lower segment – from the beginning of the project to Miners Run Creek (MP 0.0 to MP 1.3)
·	Upper segment – from Miners Run Creek to the Mission Ridge Ski Area entrance (MP 1.3 to MP 4.15).
The other difference between the two segments is that in the summer, the majority of the traffic will exit the road at or prior to Beehive Reservoir Road (MP 1.2) and the upper segment is generally used only by local traffic traveling to the ski area.
Lower Segment – Beginning to Miners Run Creek (Mileposts 0.0 to 1.3)
For the lower segment, the preferred alignment basically stays on the existing roadway with some minor curve realignment but generally within the framework of the existing road.  The new roadway is slightly shifted one direction or another to try to improve the geometry.  Near milepost 0.5, there is an existing large cut slope on the south side of the roadway.  In the preferred alternative, the roadway at this location would be shifted to the north to allow additional room for rock fall.  The roadway in this segment would require retaining wall on the north side to accommodate the shift, and to minimize the disturbance.
The lower segment of the preferred alternative travels mostly among land with homes located immediately adjacent to the roadway.  The impacts to these properties and homes were considered in the design for the roadway in this segment.
Upper Segment – Miners Run Creek to End of Project (Mileposts 1.3 to 4.15)
This segment of the roadway continues to travel through private property but also travels through some USFS property toward the end of the project.  The private property in this segment does not contain any homes but the landowners remain a consideration in the design.
For the upper segment, the alternative departs from the existing alignment in one location (MP 2.6).  This curve has been modified to shift the roadway further away from Squilchuck Creek.  The proposed curve realignment does not achieve the desired minimum AASHTO design speed; however, it would result in a substantial improvement over existing conditions.  A design exception would be required, and the remaining curves would need improvements in super elevation rates and the installation of proper warning signs, upgraded pavement markings, and safety devices.  The shift would minimize sediment plowed into the stream due to the increase in proximity of the roadway to the stream.
In the upper segment there are several switchback-type curves with minimal distance between the roadways in the switchback areas.  In the preferred alternative many of these locations would require retaining walls to provide sufficient room for a widened pavement surface and safety improvements.  Additionally in this segment, there are slopes that have slump areas and steep rock cuts that have stabilized since the original construction.  In these areas, the alignment would shift away from the existing cut slopes to minimize disturbance and the risk of future slides.  The shift would result in retaining walls on the fill slope side of the roadway to avoid long fill slopes and considerable disturbance.
Additional Widening: A slow moving vehicle pullout is planned near milepost 1.5 on the west side of the roadway.  The pullout will be approximately 300' long and would serve as both a pullout and snow storage area.  
Items of concern: The currently designed alignment is 28' in width with a considerable amount of mechanically stabilized earth retaining wall.  The width and the amount of retaining walls have a direct correlation to the overall cost of the project.  These items should be carefully considered.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR RECHARGEABLE BATTERY AND INTEGRATED CHARGER FOR THE WIRELESS INSTRUMENTATION SYSTEM ON INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer the question: "Para. 2.3 of the SOW defines a schedule of 16 weeks from contract award to delivery of flight units.  The flight units are required to meet all the specifications for present onboard systems.  This time interval appears very restrictive unless a present design already exists.  Does NASA feel that this is a correct time span for delivery of the flight units given the space qualified parts may take up to one year to be available?" The answer is as follows: The use of commercial parts is strongly suggested to accellerate the delivery schedule for this criticality 3 (nice to have, no impact to mission if it does not work) application.  We strongly encourage selecting a commercial cell design tolerant to electrical abuse such that no safety critical EEE parts are necessary to control catatrophic hazards. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 3/4/2005. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

The evaluation factors are addended as follows: 

Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose quotation conforming to this synopsis/solicitation offers the best value to the Government, technical, past performance, and price factors considered.

The Government will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a relatively superior technical rating without concern for past performance and price. 

Offerors shall submit the following past performance information: Three (3) past performance references to whom the same or similar products or services have been sold. The list of references shall include, at a minimum: the name of the reference contact person and the company or organization, the telephone number and email address of the reference contact person, the contract number, amount of the contract and address and telephone number of the Contracting Officer, if applicable, and the date of delivery.
