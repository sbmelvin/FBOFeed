<DESC>The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center intends to purchase an offshore pursuit vessel.  The specifications are:Vessel Specifications for (1) law enforcement offshore fast pursuit training vessel.
 
Recommended Vessel: Thirty Two -Foot Contender outboard or equal.
 
Vessel Specifications:
 
Maximum Length Overall (LOA): thirty-five-- (35) foot
 
Minimum Beam: ten- (10) foot
 
Maximum Draft: 24 (inches)
 
Hull Design: Deep “V” with minimum 24.5-Degree deadrise
 
Minimum Fuel Capacity: 300 Gallons
 
Maximum Horsepower Rating: 500 hp
 
Power: Pre-rigged for twin 250 HP mercury counter rotating outboard engines
 
Hull design/construction requirements:
 
This vessel will need to be manufactured primarily from fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP) commonly known as fiberglass.  The hull must be manufactured using the Baltic-coring system process.  The method uses Baltic material laminated with hand laid constructed 3610 biaxial and triaxial multi-directional fiberglass.  The process should incorporate the use of Vinyiester resin in the entire hull and upper deck.  The process should provide a superior strength to weight ratio.  The vessel must not employ wood construction in the upper deck.  The longitudinal stringers should be made of Divinycell or Klegecell foam coring, with fiberglass laminates bonding it to the hull itself.  Hull manufacturing method using wooden stringers, which is foam, encapsulated is acceptable.  The stringers are required to be manufactured in a manner to be reinforced with ¾ marine grade plywood and bonded to the hull.  The stringers must be fully bonded to the hull not merely “tacked” with cloth in places.  The stringers should be tied into the stern of the vessel and bonded to the hull.  The justification for this type of construction is the fact that this vessel will be utilized in a training environment requiring extensive offshore operations under adverse weather conditions.
 
  The hull will have to have a deep “V” design that incorporates a reverse radius chine to provide the safest and most comfortable ride in rough sea conditions.
 
This vessel must have a full transom with transom door and incorporate a dive platform as an integral part of the vessel.  This feature should not be an “add on” type bracket or platform.  The cockpit and decks must be self-bailing to allow water that enters the decks to gravity drain overboard.  All thru-hull fittings and drains must be chrome on bronze or stainless steel.  In addition, bronze or stainless steel fasteners must be used throughout the construction process.  The rub rail covering the hull/deck joint must be of heavy-duty design to ensure durability.
 
 
 
In addition to the above listed requirements, the vessel must have the following equipment:
 
•         Non-skid deck and cockpit
•         Anchor and bow line storage locker
•         Below deck dry storage lockers with cover gaskets

•         Aluminum blue light pad on top
•         Aluminum pads for GPS and antennas mounting on top
•         Armstrong floating stainless boarding ladder
•         2nd hydraulic steering cylinder for twin engine installation
•         High speed compass
•         Thru hull transducer
•         Fixed Back Leaning Post with folding foot rest
•         Fuel management system

<RESPDATE>103003
<ARCHDATE>12292003
<CONTACT>Patricia Duggan, 256-842-8875
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command proposes to award a contract on behalf of the Program Executive Office for Air, Space, and Missile Defense to Northrop Grumman Space Technology, Redondo Beach, California, for a Mobile Tactical High Energy La ser (MTHEL) weapon system prototype based upon Deuterium Fluoride (DF) chemical laser technology.  The system includes a mobile laser firing unit; fire control sensor; Battle Management, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) ; and associated software.  The MTHEL weapon system prototype is a subset of the MTHEL weapon system consisting of a mobile laser firing unit; an interface to an existing Fire Control Sensor through a tailored BMC4I system, i.e., the Government will provid e the Fire Control Sensor; and a laser control system that interfaces with an existing or emerging BMC4I system and is capable of managing up to six laser firing units.  The laser control system and BMC4I must be exportable to Israel.  Over the course of s ome 6 years, the current High Energy Laser (HEL) team has successfully conducted directly applicable tactical HEL research and development.  This requirement is under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), the services a re available from only one responsible source.  The proposed contract award will be the next increment along the path to developing a tactical HEL (THEL).  To date, both the laser technology and a cueing protocol have been successfully demonstrated against  specific targets in a test bed environment.  The MTHEL prototype program will necessarily leverage all the work to date on the Army HEL programs, as well as the proposed contractorÃ¢Â€Â™s institutional knowledge and investment.  Since a significant portio n of the prototype program will require the reduction in size of the existing designs, the understanding of the current design must be sufficient to model each system and subsystem so the reduction in size can be completed efficiently without loss of demon strated performance.  In addition to the prior successful technology development, the proposed contractor has, during the last 2 years (2000-2003), conducted trade studies and analyses to formulate the most effective configuration for a mobile HEL prototyp e.  Also, after considering responses received on 18 July 2003 to a Request for Information publicized in the Federal Business Opportunities and further considering the prior efforts of the proposed contractor, the Government has determined that award to a ny other source would result in substantial duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  See Note 22.   Please direct any response to this notice to the U.S. Army Space and Missile Command, ATTN: SMDC-CM-AK (Patricia Dugg an), P.O. Box 1500, Huntsville, AL 35807-3801.

<DESC>SOLICITATION GS-03P-03-AOC-0002

   MODERNIZATION OF THEUNITED STATES SUPREME COURT BUILDING

                    PHASE II - BUILDING

The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) with the assistance from the General Services Administration (GSA) announces this opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings and the intent to issue a solicitation for construction services for the United States Supreme Court Building, identified herein as Phase II – Building. 
The Phase II - Building project is based on work in an occupied historic building, parts of which are open to the public, with multi-phasing of work areas.  All abatement, demolition, chopping, drilling etc. will be performed after normal working hours.  All construction activities are to be coordinated with AoC building operations and the Supreme Court Police.  There is no external shell or facade work, security systems, site security or landscaping.  The project is viewed as a phased modernization rather than a restoration project.  Work includes the following elements:  (1) abatement program;  (2) upgrade of the high voltage system;  (3) replacement of the mechanical systems (With the exception of a partial retrofit in the 1950’s, the existing HVAC systems have remained as installed in 1935.  The nature of the system necessitates complete award of all basic components, introduction of new equipment, new zoning, smoke evacuation systems, as well as contemporary controls and building management systems);  (4) replacement of the electrical system (Key components of the electrical system include replacement of high voltage, secondary feeders, and smith-boards; lighting changes; distribution replacement; and the installation of generators);  (5) fire alarm system (Installation of fire alarm and smoke detection systems in the 340,000 s.f. facility are necessary);  (6) fire sprinkler system (A full sprinkler system is to be installed.);  (7) plumbing (Refurbish a limited number of bathrooms, public and staff, for code requirements and ADA compliance);   (8) windows (Refurbishing/re-anchoring existing historic bronze windows.);  (9)  structural and selective demolition (Scope includes off-hour selective demolition to provide access for MEP trades, limited structural steel reinforcement, reinforced concrete encasement and slab-on-grade replacements;  (10)  stone work (Limited removal, salvage and replacement of interior domestic white marble.);  (11)  new construction (Limited to interior fit-out of a 42,000 square foot space.  Core and shell of this space are expected to be completed in early summer of 2004.);  (12)  limited vertical transportation (One new hydraulic elevator between two floors and one new book lift connecting two floors, no modifications to existing elevators.);  (13) limited interior fit-out of existing building.

The solicitation will be issued in two (2) parts.  Part 1 will be for technical proposals and will include a set of preliminary specifications and drawings.  Under this part, the Government will evaluate past performance, technical and management capabilities, general understanding of the project and security qualifications.  Part 2 will be for pricing proposals and will include final specifications and drawings.  Prior to issuance of Part 2, offerors will be advised of their technical standing.   Firms not meeting the minimum standards for technical capability and security will be so informed and will be excluded from further participation.  The remaining offerors will be informed of their technical standing so that they can make an informed decision as to whether or not to expend the resources necessary to submit a pricing proposal under Part 2. .  After evaluation of pricing and technical proposals, the Government will award a single contract for the Phase II – Building work to the responsive and responsible firm determined by the Government to be offering the “best value” in accordance with the evaluation criteria stated in the solicitation.
The estimated construction cost for the Phase II – Building contract is $50 million to $100 million. The Contractor must provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment (except as otherwise noted), and must plan, schedule, coordinate and assure effective performance of all construction to meet United States Supreme Court Building schedule, budget and operational requirements. The Contractor must perform the work in accordance with the design specifications, drawings and provisions of the contract. 

To be considered for award, firms must submit proposals for both Part 1 and Part 2 on the due dates established in the solicitation. A pre-proposal conference/subcontractor outreach forum will be held approximately 10 days after issuance of Part 1 of the solicitation. The exact time, date and location of this meeting will be advertised in an amended synopsis and listed in the solicitation.  Interested parties may pre-register for the forum by submitting a fax to Rudy Philiposian on 202.226.1981.  Potential offerors must indicate on the fax whether they are requesting to be placed on the bidders mailing list as a prime contractor or subcontractor for this project.

The solicitation for Part 1 will be issued by the Contract Specialist at GSA, Mid Atlantic Region in Philadelphia, PA, and posted electronically on the www.fedbizopps.gov website.  It is anticipated that the solicitation for Part 1 (technical ) will be issued on or about October 8, 2003.  The final technical specifications and drawings associated with Part 2 (pricing) will be available for review in a designated Government bid room.  Any questions regarding this synopsis may be directed to Dan Correnti, GSA Contract Specialist, at (215) 446-4607.

<CONTACT>Joyce Fields, Senior Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 415-6564, Fax (301) 415-8157, Email jaf1@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to enter into a sole source contract with Conger and Elsea, Inc., entitled, "Revision of NUREG 1303, Revision 3 - Incident Investigation Manual."  The Incident Investigation Program (IIP) is described in Draft NUREG - 1303 Revision 3, "Incident Investigation Manual."  The objective of the Incident Investigation Program (IIP) is to ensure that operational significant events are investigated in a systematic and technically sound manner to gather information pertaining to the probable causes of the events, including any NRC contributions or lapses, and to provide appropriate feedback regarding the lessons of experience to the NRC, industry, and public. By focusing on probable causes of operating events and identification of associated corrective actions, the results of the IIP process improve nuclear safety by ensuring a complete technical and regulatory understanding of significant events.  Incident Investigation Teams (IIT) ensure that significant operational events are investigated in a manner that is timely, objective, systematic and technically sound; that factual information pertaining to the event is documented; that probable cause(s) are ascertained; and that a complete technical and regulatory understanding of such an event is achieved.  The purpose of this manual is to provide IIT guidance to ensure that NRC investigations of significant events are timely, structured, coordinated, and formally administered.  These guidelines address IIT activation, conduct of the investigation, conducting interviews, treatment of quarantined equipment and areas, preparation of the team report and follow-up of staff actions. These guidelines will foster uniformity, consistency, and thoroughness in IIP investigations, while permitting teams the flexibility to accommodate the diverse nature and scope of future.  In early 1986, a draft of the guidelines were provided to all the owner's groups, the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO), and the Nuclear Safety Analysis Center (NSAC) for comment.  Between January 29, 1987 and March 11, 1987, the NRC held five regional workshops to acquaint licensees with the IIP.  The IIP guidelines were last revised as NUREG - 1303, in August, 1991, to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the team leader, provide guidance on the follow-up and closeout of NRC staff actions, address lessons learned from incident investigations, and incorporate more current illustrative exhibits.  Currently, another Draft version of the guidelines exists as Draft NUREG-1303, Revision 3 (1999).  In 2001, NRC Management Directive 8.3, "NRC Incident Investigation Program" was revised.  The proposed effort will require the contractor to provide the necessary qualified personnel to revise the Incident Investigation Manual to present current investigative technologies and include recent changes in NRC organizational structure and operating environment.  Improvements to the manual are necessary in order assure efficient incident investigation processes and to realign the manual with changed NRC structure and operating environment.  Under the proposed effort, the contractor shall be required to provide a section by section update of the manual and assist NRC in developing procedures to ensure that effective incident investigation continues at NRC. Technical assistance will also be required to maintain the incident investigation capabilities of the NRC.  Updates of the manual, and revisions in procedures, require effort from the Contractor to ensure reliable performance and effective use of resources.  In addition, the contractor shall be required to provide training on the revised manual to NRC staff, on an as needed basis.  During the proposed contract performance period, it is anticipated that NUREG 1303 will be updated. The NRC's incident investigation process is a one-of-a-kind process.  The tasks required to be performed are unique and the procedures specific to the NRC's Federally mandated responsibilities for ensuring public health and safety with respect to the NRC's licensed materials have been developed by Conger and Elsea, Inc. Conger and Elsea, Inc. is particularly well qualified for this work because of previous experience in teaching incident investigation and root cause analysis for the commercial nuclear industry since 1983 and the NRC since 1986.  Training conducted  at each NRC Region office and NRC Headquarters under contract no. NRC-26-89-293 since 1989 and under contract no. NRC-26-94-263 since 1994 has provided Conger & Elsea, Inc.  Conger and Elsea, Inc. annually trains over 75 NRC staff in incident investigations, root cause analysis, and human performance investigation.  The period of performance for this procurement is four months from the date of award.  The NAICS code is 541990.  The size standard for this requirement is $5 million.  This notice is not a request for proposal nor a solicitation for offers.  Responses received to this announcement will be reviewed and evaluated by the NRC.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on the responses received to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evident that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested parties must submit technical capabilities statements and  other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRC's needs.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to Joyce A. Fields, Contracting Officer, at the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Division of Contracts, Mail Stop T-7-I-2, Washington, D.C.  220555, via USPS, not later than September 30, 2003.  This synopsis is not to be considered as request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests for information will be no be honored.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is initiating an aggressive two-phase Systems Development and Demonstration (SD&D) program for antimissile devices for commercial aircraft.  DHS will investigate directed infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) and other technologies to provide protection against man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS).  This program is not intended to develop new technologies, but rather migrate existing technologies from the military environment to the commercial airline industry.  This PRESOLICITATION NOTICE introduces the DHS Counter-MANPADS Development Strategy and announces a Briefing to Industry.  A solicitation will be released approximately two weeks prior to the Briefing to Industry.  Potential offerors should prepare questions and comments for discussion at the Briefing to Industry.  The Briefing to Industry, tentatively set for the week of 6 October 2003, will be held in the Washington, D.C. metro area.  Further details will be published through FedBizOps.  A one-day briefing to industry will consist of two parts: Program Briefing (morning) and questions/ discussion (afternoon).  The Program Briefing will include the Counter-MANPADS SPO organization, introduction of key personnel, goals and objectives, schedule, funding posture, and contracting approach (Other Transactions for Prototyping) used for the DHS Counter-MANPADS solicitation.

STRATEGY: The RDT&E strategy is to issue a two-phase solicitation for a Systems Development and Demonstration (SD&D) program, with potential awards to multiple contractors.  This program is not intended to develop new technologies, but rather migrate existing technologies from the military environment to the commercial airline industry.  Phase I of the Counter-MANPAD program will explore through an intensive six-month effort quantified solutions to the potential threat of MANPADS to commercial aircraft, followed, in Phase II, by an 18-month prototype development program using existing technology, which will be subjected to demonstration tests and evaluation.  Phase I of the program will investigate: system cost, including component, integration, and certification; airframe and avionics integration and FAA certification issues; performance against the current and emerging threat; reliability and failure rate; maintenance, including built-in testing, handling, and special ground support equipment needs; operating and support costs; concept of operations, including air crew involvement, go/no-go doctrine, and airport operational procedures.  System designs will be developed during this phase meet government-defined parameters associated with acquisition and life cycle cost, performance, reliability, maintainability, integration with commercial aviation practices and procedures; analyses that supports the ability of the designs to meet these parameters will be provided to the Government, and the Government will be provided full and complete access to the analytic and other means by which these claims are supported. Systems designs will have been expected to have passed through a critical design review during this phase. Following definition of these performance objectives, a thorough assessment will be made of the operation and supportability costs, unit system costs, and aircraft integration costs and issues to support a  Key Decision Point (KDP) 1 milestone, and later KDPs and other milestones (as defined in Department of Homeland Security Investment Review Process documentation),.  Phase II execution is contingent upon a favorable KDP-I decision.

SOLICITATION: A full and open competition will solicit proposals that shall describe existing technology and the approach offerors will employ to perform the prototype development effort in two phases.  Proposals shall describe the offeror’s technology and how it will be migrated from military applications to commercial airline applications in a cost effective manner.  Proposals shall be conceptual in nature, with the actual detailed statement of objectives and technical approach to be developed during Phase I following contract award(s).  The proposals shall address notional concept of operations; high-level system costs (acquisition and life cycle); overall aircraft integration issues; and a technical approach to modeling and simulation for assessing performance against current and emerging MANPAD threats.  The solicitation will describe top level requirements (e.g., performance, operations and supportability, and costs), program parameters (funding, schedule, and deliverables), the contracting method (Other Transactions for Prototypes), and the evaluation methodology.

PHASE I EXECUTION:  Actual performance under Phase I will address in detail: system cost, including component, integration, and certification; airframe & avionics integration and FAA certification issues; performance against the current and emerging threat; reliability and failure rate; maintenance, including built-in testing, handling, and special ground support equipment needs; operating and support costs; and concept of operations, including air crew involvement, go/no-go doctrine, and airport operational procedures.  Deliverables will document these findings.  The Government (including supporting contractors) will be provided full and complete access to the analytic and other tools used to support these findings. A Phase I mid-term review will be held to discuss progress-to-date and plans for completing the Phase I objectives, including the identification of long-lead items that may be procured during Phase I.  Awardees shall prepare technical and cost proposals for the Phase II effort (prototype development through test, evaluation, and certification).  The potential for multiple awards under Phase I exists, with a period of performance of six months.

PHASE II EXECUTION: Prototype development of two units will be initiated if a  favorable KDP-I decision is issued following Phase I.  Major activities in Phase II will include building the systems, aircraft integration, test and evaluation, and FAA certification.  Test and evaluation activities may include wind tunnel, reliability, tracking accuracy, hardware-in-the-loop and live fire testing, and operational suitability evaluations.  Operational suitability evaluations will include environmental testing, maintainability, built-in testing, handling, and special ground support equipment.   The potential for multiple awards exists, with a period of performance of 18 months.  A production decision will be based on the outcome of the Phase II effort, and will be contracted for separately.

DHS anticipates award for Phases I and II will be through Other Transactions for Prototypes, authorized under Section 831(a)(2) of P.L. 107-296.  Aggregate value of awards under Phases I and II will be approximately $100,000,000.  The Counter-MANPADS Special Program Office (SPO) within the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate will manage this effort and coordinate communications and liaison with external stakeholders such as the airlines, aircraft manufacturers, the military, civil aviation authorities (including the FAA and NTSB), airport authorities and operators, aircraft developers, aviation suppliers and pilots, and aviation maintenance organizations.

Business Gateway / E-Forms Initiative
SELECTION OF INDUSTRY SUB-SECTORS 
FOR DATA HARMONIZATION EFFORTS


THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION HAS AN OPEN REQUIREMENT FOR SERVICES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STATEMENT OF WORK.  QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS REGARDING THIS REQUIREMENT WILL ACCEPTED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 22, 2003. THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION.

Please deliver 3 copies by September 24, 2003 @ 12:00pm.  NO FAX Copies or E-mails will be accepted.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.2 Identification

1.2 Background

Reducing the regulatory burden on citizens and business owners and automating internal government processes to increase value and reduce costs are key elements of both the President’s Management Agenda (PMA) and the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA). In its report to the Congress (June 2003), the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act Task Force recommends that e-forms and harmonizing data collection and dissemination be given high priority to achieve this burden reduction. Reducing the paperwork burden is an important objective of the Business Gateway (BG) initiative (Formerly the Business Compliance One Stop.)

Because forms are the primary means of data collection and input mechanism into federal databases, they also generate massive duplication and overlap in multiple databases.  BG will “unify” the situation by addressing this redundancy both at the data and the forms levels by working with industry sectors to determine the data collected and attempt to unify the information collection to collect once and use numerous times (COUNT). 

The initial phase of the initiative will focus on the five most regulated industries: Trucking, Mining, Food, Health Care, and Chemicals.  Work has already begun on the first two industries. The purpose of this project is to select a sub-sector in each of the Food, Health Care and Chemicals industries to be the target of data harmonization during FY 2004.

1.3 Required Methodology 

The Food, Health Care, and Chemical industries include a number of sub-sectors as defined by the economic census (see appendix A). The trucking project has been limited to covering General and Specialized freight trucking. The same kind of scoping and definition process needs to be carried out for Food, Health Care, and Chemicals based on a number of factors (see a preliminary list in Section 3.0). The SBA project has identified possible industry sub-sectors and their paperwork burden (see attachment: The Regulatory Burden in Five Industries). 

The contractor shall determine a reasonable number of factors that will significantly impact the probability of success in each of the sub-sectors, determine who to interview among regulators, industry representatives, associations, vendors of industry software, states; conduct interviews and document values for each sub-sectors by the identified factors influencing project success in a report. The report shall recommend between 1 and 3 sub-sectors to target, listed in priority order, with reasons for recommendations and prioritization for each industry. Finally the contractor shall convene and facilitate a focus session/round table with those interviewed or others to elicit comments on the report and determine validity of the reports recommendations.

2.0 OBJECTIVE
The objective is to select a sub-sector and/or related forms cluster for data harmonization and forms simplification and consolidation in each of three industries. Forms cluster means a group of related forms where the industry sees them as related to each other and ripe for the efforts of the project even if they do not perfectly align with a single industry sub-sector. The challenge is to find a sub-sector or forms cluster where the probabilities of successful data harmonization and forms simplification and consolidation are high. SBA believes there is a higher probability of success if:
•	The industry is already engaged in efforts to build XML schemas and other data standards,
•	There are willing public and private champions, 
•	There are already efforts to do what our project proposes, 
•	There are vendors providing software that use data mining and other methods to assist firms in filing Federal forms, 
•	There are efforts at the state level in overhauling data requirements, 
•	The industry sector or forms cluster to be addressed is reasonably scoped, 
•	There is a lot of redundancy in data requirements in industry sector or forms cluster, 
•	There is a strong need to act to address a problem or relieve a large paperwork burden that inhibits economic growth, and 
•	Flexible and innovative software/solutions vendors who can adapt their products to incorporate the harmonized data and forms created by the project in the routine processes and features of that product


3.0 SCOPE
The contractor will have to quickly compile sufficient facts to permit the selection of industry sub-sectors in a manner that will ensure project success. A preliminary list of factors includes:
•	Size of the sub-sector 
•	The volume and complexity of Federal forms within the sector
•	How much redundancy exists between forms
•	The value harmonization of those forms will provide
•	The availability of a regulatory agency champion for changing the forms
•	The availability of an industry champion for changing the forms
•	Associations that can serve as champions or cooperate with the project
•	Intermediates and customer agents that can cooperate with project
•	Pre-existing and ongoing efforts to establish industry data models, schema, dictionaries, standards, and common practices
•	Whether pre-existing industry data efforts have addressed government required data contained within the forms
•	Pre-existing public and private efforts to accomplish the simplification, harmonization, and/or consolidation goals of the project and the level of success of those efforts (for example, trucking has a long history of efforts, many successful, to standardize and streamline a number of forms and regulatory processes)
•	The availability of vendors who produce industry and government software solutions to champion the project and work to incorporate the data and form  process into the solutions they sell to the selected industry and to government
•	Current roadblocks regarding data collection and forms that need to be fixed before harmonization should be considered

4.0 TASK AND DELIVERABLE DESCRIPTION 

There are a number of tasks to be completed. The Business Gateway project has already developed a list of the relevant NAICS codes for potential candidates, and a report of the regulatory burden in the five selected industries.

The contractor shall:
1.	Improve and further define the indicators essential to the probability of success and create a matrix/table format for analysis and recommendations of each factor by sub-sector and/or forms cluster
2.	Through research, document review, and contacts with regulators, industry representatives, industry associations, third party vendors of software, state agencies, and other persons or entities determined by the contractor in consultation with SBA, collect facts for each indicator
3.	Talk to representatives from concerned industries to get their views on the need for harmonization and the possibilities of success and then validate the contractor’s sub-sector, forms cluster, and prioritization recommendations and analysis 
4.	A report containing a summary of input received, analysis of choices, recommendations as to the 1 to 3 sub-sectors and/or forms clusters in each industry to be selected, and the feedback received from the validation process

Deliverables:

1.0 A list of tasks and the final list of factors (see 3.0 and 4.1.1 above) for SBA approval
2.0 A report that includes the following:
2.1 A list of persons, organizations contacted, and their views
2.2 A single appendix containing electronic copies of documents or links to the Internet location of such documents used in preparation of the report
2.3 A completed matrix of indicators by sub-sector and/or forms cluster
2.4 Recommendations in summary narrative form and within the matrix
2.5 Feedback received in validation activities
3.0 Presentation of this report to Business Gateway Program Management Office and representatives from industry verticals 

  
5.0 EXPERTISE
Essential Skills Needed: 

•	Excellent communication skills needed to converse with diverse individuals  
•	Ability to clearly document project scope using business terminology 
•	Ability to clearly articulate the problem at hand and 
•	Excellent problem solving ability
•	Knowledge of industry business and data systems  

   
The vendor must be sure that the project scope is clear and complete before he or she can begin gathering information. Defining and documenting the project scope requires the vendor to understand why the project has been initiated (project statement of purpose) and the goals of the project (project objectives). An important contribution of the vendor to the project is the discipline to analyze the business problem without "jumping" to a solution. 

In addition, a complete project scope will name and define all of the organizations that will be involved with the project; this may include people, systems, internal departments, and outside organizations (project external interactions).

Other important components of the project scope documentation include the project viewpoint, project assumptions, and business risks. These components give the vendor the information necessary to prioritize and focus their information gathering. 


6.0 DELIVERY SCHEDULE

The work must be completed according to the following schedule. Optional deliverables will be coordinated for delivery date if needed:

Deliverable	Due Date
Project plan and factor list	3 working days after award


9.0	ADMINISTRATIVE CONSIDERATIONS

10.0	 TRAVEL 

10.1 Travel

There will be no reimbursement for travel expenses incurred within the Washington, DC metropolitan area.

11.0 PERSONAL SERVICE

13.0 TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS AND EVALUATION METHODOLOGY

Technical proposal will be evaluated against the following criteria:

Technical Factor One (10 points): Technical Understanding of Requirements and Viability of Methods Proposed to Produce Deliverables and Comply With the Delivery Schedule

Basis of Evaluation: Offers will be evaluated to determine the offeror’s demonstrated understanding of the technical requirements and suitability of the proposed approach, deliverables, and schedule to the project needs and requirements. 

Technical Factor Two (10 points): Past Performance/Corporate Experience

Basis of Evaluation: The proposal will be evaluated to assess the corporate experience of the offeror with respect to projects similar in scope and size to the work described herein.

Technical Factor Three (50 points): Professional Staff

Basis of Evaluation: The resumes submitted by the offeror will be evaluated to assess the availability and qualifications of the proposed staff, their experience in similar projects, and their capability to fully and professionally accomplish the objectives stated herein.

14.0 PRICE EVALUATION FACTORS AND EVALUATION METHODOLOGY

The Government will make award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered.  For this solicitation, technical quality is more important than cost or price, as follows:

        WEIGHT 

        Technical		70 pts

        Cost	         	30 pts 

        (b)  Cost points will be calculated as follows: 

                (1)  The lowest priced technically acceptable proposal receives 30 points. 

                (2)  The other proposals in the acceptable range receive points according the following 
                       ratio: 

Cost Formula Points for Proposal (N) = Price of Lowest Price Offeror x30  Price of Proposal (N) 

Example:  ABC Company, Inc (Lowest price proposal) 30 pts $42,030 
          XYZ Company, Inc proposal price = $44,160 
          XYZ Company, Inc. = $42,030 
Cost Formula Points = $44,160 = .952 x 30 = 28.56 pts. 

15.0	ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST & NON DISCLOSURES

1.	The contractor will not be eligible to compete for the prime implementation contracts

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the Office of the Air Force plans to offer the privatization of the existing Electric, Natural Gas, Water and Wastewater utility systems located at Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station (ARS) and Pittsburgh Air National Guard Base (ANGB), PA.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, firm(s) will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firms(s) will be required to purchase the existing system from the Government and may be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the Government.  The resulting contract(s), if awarded, will require the Contractor(s) to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate, the utility system(s).  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor(s) shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The Contractor(s) proposals and plans may become a part of the contract upon the decision to award.  Past Performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP.  No Offeror will be denied the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.

Utility Systems being privatized are described as follows:
Installation:  Pittsburgh ARS
Location: Pittsburgh, PA
Installation Description:  The 911th Air Wing (AW) is located in the western portion of Allegheny County, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, within the Pittsburgh International Airport (IAP).  The Base is approximately 16 miles northwest of downtown Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania.  The 911th AW encompasses approximately 115 acres (12 owned and 103 acres leased) in the eastern portion of the Pittsburgh IAP.  The 911th AW has a total of 56 buildings.
Utility systems to be privatized: 
a.	Electric:
      Exelon Energy and Duquesne Light supply the electrical power to the Pittsburgh ARS, Pittsburgh IAP, through two primary distribution lines owned and maintained by Duquesne Light Company.  Exelon Energy supplies 68 percent of the electricity while Duquesne Light supplies 32 percent of the required electrical power.  The primary source originates at Duquesne’s Mountour substation approximately four miles ease of the Base and delivers 17,055 kilovolt-amperes (kVA) via 22.9 kilovolt (KV) overhead transmission lines.  The primary is stepped down at the Base substation to 4.16 kV to feed the Base primary.  An alternate source begins at the Russell Burdsall and Ward substation located three miles north of the Base, and delivers 10,313 kVA through 22.9kV overhead transmission lines.  Duquesne Light’s lines terminate at the base substation (Facility 212).  Automatic sectionalizing switches control the two circuits, providing automatic switching capability in the event of a power outage.  A three-phase 1500kV transformer owned by the power company steps down the voltage to 4160Volt (V) primary distribution for the Base.  Government ownership starts at the substation demand-side (secondary) with two 1200 Amp vacuum switches protecting two 4160V feeders.  From the substation, a combination overhead/underground system serves the majority of the base facilities.  The Base has a total of 55 buildings.  Base drawings show approximately 8,888 LF overhead cables and 15,555 LF of underground cables.  All of the PCB-contaminated electrical equipment has been replaced.  The system also includes the following:  (1)  59 transformers ranging from 10 kVA to 750 kVA; (2) 91 utility poles of various heights; (3) 14 switches (2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-way); and (4) 20 buildings have electric meters installed.  There is no Supervisory Council and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for remote operation or monitoring of the electrical system.  However, the Base has programmed a Demand Side Energy Reduction initiative that will provide load shedding of building air conditioning systems when a preset demand level is reached. The substation was constructed in the mid-1950’s.  The underground circuits are newer, with construction dates ranging from the mid-1960’s to present.  Equipment such as transformers average in age from 25 years for pole-mounted and 5 years for those on pads.  The underground cables are relatively new being installed in the 1990’s; a portion of the overhead (400 area) is part of the original 1940’s installation.  The existing Duquesne-owned substation is operating at its maximum capacity, and the base-owned switchgear is weak, requiring the base to restore power incrementally after outages.  The distribution system is generally in fair condition, and the positioning of switches throughout the system provides a degree of backup from one circuit to another.  A number of utility poles require replacement, as do some of the strain reliefs.  The Base has total of 58 facilities of which 16 are metered.

b.	Natural Gas:
      Peoples Natural Gas Company supplies natural gas to the 911th AW.  Gas is brought to the Base through a 6-inch coated and wrapped steel feeder pipe operating at 40 psi.  The 6-inch supply line enters the Base southeast of the main gate and runs parallel along Defense Avenue to the metering station located at Building 119.  At the metering station, pressure is reduced to 10 psi, and then distributed to Base facilities through piping ranging from 0.5 to 4-inches.  Thirty-six buildings have gas meters installed.  The existing 18,150 LF of pipe is polyethylene, which has been inserted in the original steel lines.  The polyethylene pipe has a tracer wire to facilitate locating this pipe.  The metering station is the only entry point for natural gas, and other than the building regulators, this is the only point where pressure is reduced.  Peoples Natural Gas owns all natural gas lines and the meter and regulator system to the point of pressure reduction; 911th AW assumes ownership of the gas lines on the “low-side” of the reducing station.  Plastic isolation valves located at each building and throughout the system enable portions to be isolated for maintenance.  The system was extensively replaced in FY 1991.  No code violations were observed during the site visit, and the system is in very good condition.

c.	Water Distribution System:
     Potable water is supplied to the 911th AW from the Moon Township Municipal Authority (MTMA) via a 12-inch main.  The water is metered and then delivered into the distribution system through the base’s 8-insh main.  The average pressure supplied to the Base is 90 psi.  The 911th AW provides no additional treatment, and the Base has no active potable water wells.  Water storage is provided by a 1.5-million gallon elevated water storage tank, which is located on-base but owned and operated by the MTMA.  The elevated storage tank is supplied through a 16-inch main, which is also owned by MTMA.  The elevated storage tank serves both the local community and the installation, and the MTMA reserves 300,000 gallons of water exclusively for the base’s fire protection requirements.  An additional ground-level tank stores 165,000 gallons of water used only for fire protection of two flightline facilities.  The Base water distribution system is government-owned and consists of approximately 26,000 linear feet of water mains and service laterals.  The majority of the mains were upgraded in 1991 with polyvinyl chloride (PVC); the remaining original system is ductile iron.  Most of the base’s original system was abandoned in place during the upgrade.  Most of the 911th AW water lines distribution water through a looped system; however, the system has some dead-end lines.  The water distribution system is generally in excellent condition.  Flow volume is good, and system pressures are well balanced.  Pressures at the fire hydrants are consistently in the 90-100 psi range with good flow.  Vales, which are generally older than the distribution lines, are all accessible and in good operating condition.  There are no known code violations.  There are 58 facilities on the Base of which only 6 are metered.  

d.	Wastewater Collection System:
     Wastewater generated by 911th AW is carried off base through a 15-inch sewer main in the southeast corner of the base, and disposed of through Moon Township Municipal Authority (MTMA) sanitary sewer lines and sewage treatment facility.  Sewage is not metered prior to entering the MTMA sanitary sewer system; instead the Base is billed for sewage treatment fees based upon 100 per cent of its potable water consumption.  Industrial wastes are treated through oil/water separators, which subsequently discharge directly to the sanitary sewer system.  The Base system meets all known regulatory requirements, and the discharge is compatible with MTMA’s requirements.  The 911th AW wastewater collection system consists of 19,640 feet of gravity-flow vitrified clay pipe.  The collection system includes laterals, oil/water separators, underground holding tanks, and collector mains.  The Base has no lift stations and the oil/water separators are not part of this contract.  Service laterals are typically 4- to 6-inches in diameter; mains range from 6- to 8-inches.  The wastewater collection system is generally in fair condition.  Most of the system is original and has not been lined, but the base’s terrain and slopes provide for adequate flow, and base personnel report no problems with blockages or backups.

Installation:  Pittsburgh Air National Guard Base
Location:  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Installation Description:  The 171st Air Refueling Wing (ARW) installation is located at the Pittsburgh International Airport (IAP) approximately 16 miles northwest of downtown Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania.  The 171st ARW occupies 179 acres and contains approximately 51 buildings and structures.  This land is leased from the Allegheny County Department of Aviation.

Utility systems to be privatized:

a.	Electrical:
     CMS Marketing Service and Trading provides the electrical commodity to the 171st ARW through two lines owned and maintained by Duquesne Light Company.  Duquesne’s lines terminate at the base substation (Facility 101).  A three-phase, 1500 kilovolt-ampere (kVA) transformer owned by the power company steps down the voltage to 4160 Volts (V) primary distribution for the base.  Electrical power for the entire base is metered at the substation.  Government ownership starts at the substation demand-side (secondary) with the switchgear.  From the substation, the system feeds the base with two separate circuits, one supplying the area west of the airfield, and the other supplying areas south and east of the airfield.  Base drawings show approximately 13,130 LF of underground secondary conductors, 4,530 LF of primary underground conductors, approximately 3,840 LF of overhead secondary conductors, and 5,740 LF of primary overhead cables.  The system also includes the following:  (1) 55 transformers ranging from 10kVA to 500 kVA; (2) 67 utility poles of various heights; (3) 22 airfield light stanchions; and (4) 3 double throw vacuum switches.  There is no Supervisory Council and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for remote operation or monitoring of the electrical system.  However, Duquesne has the capability to remotely read the electric meter at the substation through a modem.  In addition, there are on 3 facilities of 44 that have meters.  The existing system is primarily underground, with above ground lines in a few areas.  The system varies in age from 7 to 50 years.  The underground cable was installed in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) conduit with concrete casings in 1992.  Most of the overhead cable is original, installed in the early 1950’s.  Transformers and associated equipment range in age from approximately 25 years for pole mounted and approximately 5 years for those on pads.  All of the underground cables and ducts, and most of the overhead cables are in good condition.  Transformers are generally in good condition, and all of the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminated electrical equipment has been replaced.  Manholes and power poles are in good condition, although the manholes are considered confined spaces for maintenance entry and two poles have minor problems with structural loads.  The base has systematic problems with 3-phase equipment motors (such as for air conditioning compressors) burning up due to single phasing characteristics when power is intermittently lost or when restoring base power after outages.  The base is studying the installation of a 3-phase loss relay system to rectify the problem.  There are no known code violations or discrepancies.  Lli Technologies and Sergeant Electric maintain the 171st ARW electrical utilities through service contracts.  
 
b.	Natural Gas Distribution System:
CMS Marketing Services and Trading supplies natural gas to the 171st ARW through a 6-inch coated and wrapped steel feeder pipe owned by the Peoples Natural Gas Company.  Pressure is reduced from 40 psi to 10 psi at the metering station on Cliff Mine Road and then distributed to base facilities through piping ranging from 0.5 to 4 inches.  Pipe material is a combination of black iron and polyethylene.  The Cliff Mine Road metering station is the only entry point for natural gas, and other than the building regulators, this is the only regulators with shut-off valves.  Peoples owns all natural gas lines, meters, and regulators to the point of pressure reduction; the 171st ARW assumes ownership of the gas lines o the “low-side” of the reducing station.  Base drawings show approximately 9,400 LF of gas mains on-base.  Approximately 1,610 LF of steel piping was replaced in 1990 and the remaining 7,800 LF was installed in 1955.  There are no valves on the distribution system, other than those at the buildings.  The portions of the system with black iron pipe are approximately 45 years old; the polyethylene pipe is less than 10 years old.  The 171st ARW has no personnel or equipment on-base to repair breaks or leaks in the polyethylene pipe, and therefore maintains the natural gas system by service contract on an as required basis.

c.	Water Distribution System:
     Water is supplied to the 171st ARW from the Moon Township Municipal Authority (MTMA) via a 10-inch ductile iron main that runs beneath the runway 32-14 and the approaches to runways 28L and 28C.  The base does not own or maintain this 10-inch water line.  The base owns the supply line an distribution mains.  A single meter located near the base of the elevated water storage tank located at the 911th AW meters the main feed from MTMA.  MTMA owns and reads this meter.  Findlay Township provides a backup water source, which enters the base at the main gate and is metered in a pit near the main gate just inside the installation property.  Findlay owns and reads this meter.  After metering, the water enters the base distribution system, which is a combination of several loops, and a number of long dead-end branches.  There are no water meters installed at the facilities.  The average pressure supplies to the base is 90 psi.  The base has a 150,000 gallon storage tank which is used for fire protection only.  The 171st ARW provides not additional water treatment and the base has no active potable wells.  Including the supply lines to the base, water mains are comprised of approximately 19,419 LF of pipe, most of which is 8-inch asbestos cement that is nearly 50 years old.  The system’s dead ends do not appear to create any maintenance problems; the system balance is good, the dead ends all provide a mean for flushing, and the base reports no sediment or brown water problems.  The system’s age, however, presents several serious problems.  System repairs are difficult because of the high percentage of mains located under the airfield-parking ramp and other pavements, and the proximity of the mains to buildings and other obstacles.  The supply line running under the ramp breaks, on average, once a winter.  The system’s 55 valves are properly located for isolation purposes, but maintenance personnel estimate that only 15 of them work properly.  There are 28 fire hydrants and associated 4.5-inch valves located on base.  Hydrant-testing results reveal insufficient flow for adequate fire protection.  Since the main pipes appear to be adequately sized to meet the base’s requirements, this is likely due to the constricting effects of mineral deposits on interior pipe walls.  This assessment is based on the number of water line breaks to the system and the condition of the piping replaced or repaired.  There are no known code violations.  The foregoing problems could be corrected by replacing the base’s 6- and 8-inch mains with new 8-inch mains and changing the supply source to eliminate the main running under the ramp area.  The base has already identified two alternative recommendations to the current supply sources.  These alternatives recommend switching to Findley as the primary source (assuming they have adequate capacity) and extending a main east of the base to connect to MTMA’s distribution system near Beaver Grade Road.  This assessment was made during 1999, therefore, some of these problems may have been rectified.  The base has facility backflow preventer units installed, however, these backflow units are not part of this contract.  There are no large backflow preventers on the distribution system.  The 171st ARW maintains the water distribution system by service contract with local plumbing contractor(s).

d.	Wastewater Collection System:  
     Wastewater generated by the 171st ARW flows off-base through a 8-inch sewer main in the southeast corner of the base, discharged into Moon Township Municipal Authority’s (MTMA) 18-inch sanitary sewer line and treated at MTMA’s sewage treatment facility.  Base ownership ends at MTMA’s 18-inch line.  Sewage is not metered prior to entering the MTMA sanitary sewer system; instead the base is billed for sewage treatment fees based on 100 percent of its potable water consumption.  Industrial wastes are treated through oil/water separators, which subsequently discharge directly to the sanitary sewer system.  The oil/water separators are not part of this contract.  The base system meets all known regulatory requirements and the discharge is compatible with MTMA’s requirements.  The 171st ARW wastewater collection system consists of primarily 7,626 feet of gravity-flow pipe.  The collection system include laterals, oil/water separators, underground holding tanks, and collector mains.  The base has one lift station with an ejector pump, which serves only Building 316.  It is new as a result of that new construction.  The lift station is only operated when there is a UTA weekend and occasionally thereafter during the year.  Service laterals are typically 3- to 6-inches in diameter, and mains range from 6- to 8-inches.  Most of the system consists of original vitrified clay pipe installed in the 1950’s.  The 171st ARW has 31 manholes.  Many of these manholes require maintenance as result of age.  The major problems are wall repairs, ring repairs, and re-grouting.  Three manholes require rising, 1 requires lowering to facilitate waste flow, and the other 27 require maintenance and repair as specified above.  The 171st ARW maintains the wastewater collection system by service contract with local plumbing contractor(s).

The utility systems being privatized are described as follows: The Hickam AFB, HI Electric Distribution System is power supplied from two Hawaiian Electric Company (HECO) sources at 46 kV.  The HECO sources are overhead to near the Base’s “Front Station” where HECO-owned transformers step the voltage down to 12.47/7.2 kV for distribution throughout the Base.  Base power distribution lines are both overhead and underground and serve a combination of Base housing units, office-type facilities, and mission support facilities.  In addition to the Front Station switchgear, there is the “Back Station” which includes switchgear for distribution to the southern portion of the Base.  Two underground express feeders connect the Front Station to the Back Station.  Additional feeders provide a loop between the two stations.  There are approximately 20 miles of overhead primary distribution, 26 miles of underground distribution, and approximately 500 building service step-down transformers.  The 1998 consumption for the entire facility was 77.2 million kWh with a peak demand of 23,7000 kW.

The Hickam AFB, HI Water Distribution System is supplied to Hickam AFB by the U.S. Navy.  There are six metered connections to the Navy potable water system that supply water to the Hickam AFB potable water distribution system.  Three of the meters are an 18-inch turbine meter with a telescopic register and totalizer, installed in below-grade concrete vaults.  The other three meters are 12-inch Hershey compound meters that have low-, medium-, and high-flow registers also installed in below-grade concrete vaults.  The U.S. Navy is currently servicing these compound meters.  A 12-inch connection to the Board of Water Supply water system that is located near the Honolulu International Airport side of the installation has been valved off from the system and is not currently used.  The distribution system at Hickam AFB includes piping, valves, backflow preventers, meters, and associated appurtenances.  Distribution network main pipelines range in size from 4 to 18 inches in diameter and are constructed of case iron, asbestos cement, ductile iron, and PVC pipe.  Service laterals are typically 1- to 3-inch copper pipe.  There are approximately 463,700 linear feet of piping.  Water usage by the Base averages approximately 6.5 mgd.  Hickam AFB is currently regulated by the State of Hawaii Safe Drinking Water Branch and is classified as a consecutive distribution system coupled to the Navy’s potable water system.

The Hickam AFB Wastewater Collection System is treated at the Fort Kamehameha Sewage Treatment Plant (STP), which is under U.S. Navy jurisdiction and ownership and is located in the western portion of the Base.  Wastewater is collected at Hickam AFB in several wastewater collection systems consisting of approximately 406,455 linear feet of vitrified clay, reinforced concrete, PVC, ACP, VP, and cast-iron piping ranging in size from 4 to 24 inches in diameter.  Wastewater collection piping at Hickam AFB includes both gravity and pressure piping systems.  The wastewater collection system includes 33 sewage pump and lift stations, ranging in size from approximately 100 to 1,000 gpm.  Wastewater flows are estimated to average 2.2 mgd.  Effluent from the Fort Kamehameha STP discharges into Pearl Harbor from an 18-inch outfall under the Navy’s NPDES permit for the STP.

The Bellows Air Force Station, Waimanalo, HI Electric Distribution System is supplied from two separate HECO sources at 4.16/2.7 kV.  The northern portion of the system is approximately 2 miles of overhead primary with 30 customer service transformers representing about 940 kVA of capacity.  The southern portion of the system is approximately 1.2 miles of overhead primary and 0.6 miles of underground primary with 14 customer service transformers representing 320 kVA of capacity.  The 1998 consumption for the entire facility was 2.4 million kWh with a peak demand of 527 kW.

The Bellows Air Force Station, Waimanalo, HI Water Distribution System is supplied to Bellows AFS by the Board of Water Supply distribution system.  The Base potable water distribution system includes two metered connections to Board of Water Supply mains, fire hydrants, valves, and approximately diameter.  The Base water system is currently not regulated by the State of Hawaii Safe Drinking Water Branch and is classified as a single-connection to the Board of Water Supply.

Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR Fuel Storage and Distribution System.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following questions and to extend the delivery date. 1.  In regards to the fuel storage tank RFQ, would you want unloading the tank to be included in the proposal. ANSWER:  We do not want unloading to be included in the proposal.  We do require engineered lifting attachments and the weight of the system. 2.  Line item eleven under the dispensing system head reads: "JP-7 HC-1633150 Filter / Separator / Coalescer.	Rated at 240 GPM."  It appears that the system should use an API 1582 Type II Class B filter vessel or two-stage filter vessel.  Can you please confirm this.  Also, not familiar with HC-16333150.  Is this a part number for a specific brand of filter vessel?  If so what is the manufacturer. 3.  This question is in regards to the system's carrier rate.  Line item eight under the dispensing system head states that the system shall have a 30 GPM flow control valve for loading into test vessels.  Line item 13 states that the system shall be capable of bottom loading through a 2 1/2" x 12' hose and Thiem Nozzle.  Will the hose and nozzle mentioned in line 13 be used to load the test vessels?  If not what type of nozzle, hose is required to fill the test vessel?  If so should the system's bottom loading rate be 30 GPM or should it be 200 GPM (the rate of the pump)? ANSWER:  The filter specification was listed incorrectly in the solicitation.  The proper identifier is HV-1633150 Filter/Separator/Coalescer and the unit is manufactured by Velcon. This unit does meet API 1582 Type II Class B. ANSWER:  The bottom loading connection is required to pump JP-7 out of a delivery tanker into the storage tank.  The Air Force has a 6000 gallon tanker truck, but the truck does not have an off-loading pump.  The unit will pump the fuel off the truck into the storage tank at a flow rate of 200 gpm.	This will be used for off-loading the truck only.  Another means of providing the fuel to the test vessels must be provided that gives a flow rate of 30 gpm to the test vessel.  No hose is required for this as field piping must be installed to deliver the fuel approximately 100 yards from the bulk storage tank.  The offerer must supply a connection point to the bulk system that can deliver 30 gpm to the piping being installed by NASA.  This piping work is the responsibility of NASA. The due date for receipt of offers is extended to September 19, 2003.

All responsible sources to submit a proposal will be considered by this agency.  Following is the Statement Of Work. SCOPE OF WORK DEPLOYMENT OF THE  FLOODPLAIN INVENTORY APPLICATION TOOL BACKGROUND The Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources Implementation Studies and Corps of Engineer planning regulations require Corps district offices to estimate wit h and without-project expected annual damages to determine the benefits of flood damage reduction projects.  A portion of these benefits accrues from reduction in damages to commercial structures and their contents.  Corps district offices typically apply depth-damage functions to determine the amount of damage as a percentage of the structure or content value in one-foot increments.  Corps regulations further require district offices to make assessments of percent damage functions based on either area-spec ific surveys or survey of comparable floodplains that reflect similar hydrologic and building characteristics.  However, district offices are rarely equipped with the necessary financial resources or personnel for doing the expensive and time-consuming sur veys required for producing these damage functions.  Developing default content and structure depth-damage functions for use by the Districts has been identified as a way of reducing the costs and time of studies.  The Flood Damage Data Collection Program is an ongoing activity focused on using actual flood damage information to estimate flood losses and to develop automated approaches to apply that information.  The Corps of Engineers Floodplain Inventory Tool (CEFIT) is a computer application contains 960  depth-damage functions for residential structures.  Damages are estimated for 16 inundation levels, based on foundation type, structure style, number of stories, and exterior wall construction.  Additionally, the program has developed a floodplain invento ry tool that allows the user to enter specific building characteristics.  The tool then calculates depreciated structure and content values and depth-damage calculations.  Assumptions regarding depth-damage functions have been premised on component-based e stimates of repair costs.  An expert panel of experienced flood damage inspectors has reviewed the major assumptions in the original model related to quantity and value of items in a household inventory, the structural elements that are likely to be damage d and their repair costs, and the content items that are like to be damaged or destroyed and the costs for repair or replacement.  Work of the expert panel has been incorporated in the model, enabling the Institute for Water Resources to test the results a nd the validity of the CEFIT model.  To operate successfully the model must be populated with the most recent costs and repair data.  Any proprietary data must be licensed to all Corps offices that would be using the data. OBJECTIVE This work effort will provide populating and licensing of data for a working floodplain inventory tool that provides residential structure and content valuations and associated -damage calculations with uncertainty for import to the Hydrologic Engineering CenterÃ¢Â€Â™s Flood Damage Analysis program.  The contract is also to provide commercial structure and content value for use in Corps of Engineers flood damage reduction studies. APPROACH AND SCOPE The Contractor will populate current the Corps of Engineers Floodplain Inventory Tool with residential structure value estimation data for estimating depreciated replacement costs, content value estimation data, and repair databases for estimating for remo val, cleaning, repair, and replacement.  It is intended that these data be updated every two years and licensed annually.  The Contractor will perform all necessary testing to insure that the software reliably receives and exports data and remains function al on personal computers with Windows 95 or higher operating systems. TASKS AND OUTPUT Task One Participate in a Half-Day Meeting:  The Contractor will participate in a one-day meeting to review the requirements for the deliverables. Task Two Populate the Content Value, Structure Damage, and Content Damage Data Tables in the CEFIT Model and Supply User Documentation: The Contractor will incorporate all necessary and the most recent versions of data to enable CEFIT to calculat e residential structure values. The database updates will be consistent with the price levels currently in use for construction costs, household content values, and structural repair costs.  Costs will be itemized by building component for removal, cleanin g, repair, and replacement.  The Contractor will also provide a brief userÃ¢Â€Â™s documentation that will illustrate the step-by-step process for data entry, importing data, calculation, and exporting results from CEFIT to the HEC-Flood Damage Analysis pro gram.   Task Three Submit Revised and Updated Software and Site Licenses for 45 Users and Provide Technical Support The Contractor will provide the revised and updated software package ready for installation on a Windows 95 operating system as a runtime application or as Access 2000 database application.  Forty-five copies of the application will be submitted on read-on ly CD ROMs.  The CD ROMs will include and be licensed for residential structure repair and replacement data, a residential value estimator software package for estimating depreciated replacement values for all states and U.S. territories, a commercial soft ware package for estimating depreciated replacement values for all states and U.S. territories, and a software package for estimating commercial content values. The Contractor will supply technical support via telephone for the duration of the license peri od. TASKS	MILESTONES Task One: Participate in a Half-Day Meeting	Within 10 Days of Notice to Proceed Task Two: Populate the Content Value, Structure Damage, and Content Damage Data Tables in the CEFIT Model and Supply User Documentation	Within 30 Days of Notice to Proceed Task Three: Submit Revised and Updated Software and Site Licenses for 45 Users and Provide Technical Support	Within 45 Days of Notice to Proceed

<DESC>The following information is changed:  The floor nozzle measures 32" wide not 36" wide as specified.  The wall nozzle measures 20" wide not 24" wide as specified.  The vacuum hose is light weight 2" x 15' not 1.5" x 15' as specified.  All other information remains unchanged.  Additional information is hereby provided:  The application of the HEPA vacuum for our mission is two fold.  (1) Lead abatement issues concerning the removal of lead dust build-up on our indoor range facility and (2) the second requirement is for range cleaning of the ranges on a daily basis. The vacuum will be required to trap and self contain lead dust particles for disposal through our hazardous waste disposal process.  This is a mandatory requirement. It will also need to vacuum the range floors/walls/ceilings to remove dirt and dust. The vacuum will be utilized in a shooting range environment where unburnt gun powder will exist. This gun powder is highly flammable and is subject to a flash over ignition. The machine will be required to be certified explosion proof for gun powder. The power restrictions on the indoor range facility is 125 volt 20 amps available. The machine will be required to work 24/7 to accommodate our training schedule. We will be requiring a dry vac only. The range debris will consist of not only unburnt gun powder but small bullet fragments, shotgun filler particles as well as everyday dirt and debris from shoes and a high volume student training environment.

<DESC>ALERT System - Request for Information 

Description:  The following Request for Information (RFI) is issued for purposes of conducting market research and allowing commercial IT companies to propose technologies and/or methodologies that could be utilized to identify and monitor potential fraud in the Food Stamp Program.  All responses are due not later than 11:00am (local time) Wednesday, October 22, 2003.  Comments, suggestions and questions about the proposed new technology may supplement or be incorporated into the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service’s (FNS) decision support system called the Anti-fraud Locator using EBT Retailer Transactions (ALERT).  FNS is in the process of formulating the acquisition and project strategy for the next base contract and as a result wants to identify commercially available technologies that could be either incorporated into the ALERT system or separately implemented.  FNS has obtained the support of Information Systems Support, Inc. (ISS) and MAXIMUS, Inc, as independent technical consultants assisting in the review of the RFI responses.  ISS/MAXIMUS is prohibited from submitting a proposal to any procurement request that may result from this RFI.  

All information submitted in response to this RFI will be used for planning purposes only.  FAR Clause 52.215-3 Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (OCT 1997) applies.  All information will be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure.  Please ensure any sensitive or protected information is clearly marked as such.  FNS will consider all information received for future incorporation into ALERT as it evaluates the responses received from the vendor community.  This is not a formal solicitation under FAR Part 15 or a FAR Part 13 simplified acquisition, but a request for interested parties to provide information.  No solicitation document exists and requests for a solicitation will be unanswered.

An overview of data elements and other technical information regarding the current system may be accessed at the USDA website:  http://www.fns.usda.gov/.

COTS: Vendors with various technology products are encouraged to respond to this request with a high level concept paper that explains the approach and offers new technologies and/or methodologies that would improve the current tools of FNS in its analysis of ALERT data.  It is requested that responses include an estimate (Rough Order of Magnitude of the time and costs (hardware, software, and personnel) needed to design and implement.  We do not expect full cycle system developments to be offered, but are specifically interested in proven products, technologies and/or tools that enhance or provide additional capabilities to identify and monitor potential fraud using the existing and future data elements available from Food Stamp Program Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) transactions.  FNS will use the information received from the responses to this RFI to help determine the requirements for the next RFP for ALERT support.  FNS anticipates releasing the RFP for ALERT support in the 1st quarter of 2004.  

Current Architecture: The current ALERT application is a n-tiered server architecture that operates on Proliant 8500 servers using the Windows 2000 operating system and Sybase database system software.  The application software is programmed using Delphi.  There are four main software components 
¨	The ALERT analysis software includes specific scans that target certain suspect patterns of fraudulent activity.  ALERT utilizes data from two sources; transaction data that is received from the states operation EBT systems, and retailer data that is extracted from present mainframe systems that house the FNS national retailer database for authorizing and monitoring participating Food Stamp retailers.
¨	A web site provides user information on existing releases, tutorials and a data mart known as AMART.  
¨	ESSRA is a component which provides retailer management data that has been extracted weekly from the FNS national retailer tracking database.  ESSRA is used in the field and regional offices to manage daily retailer authorization activities and allows users to download data into standard Excel spreadsheets or Access tables for further manipulation 
¨	Watchlist is a management reporting tool designed to systemically track identified suspect retailers and the status of activities by FNS staff regarding each identified retailer.  
	
	FNS’ overall enterprise architecture is transitioning from mainframe to server and web-based technologies.  Current software standards require Section 508 compliance for all agency systems.  FNS is migrating to SQL Server 2000, which will become the database system for ALERT in the future.  Users are provided Windows 2000 and Office Suite products on their workstations or laptops installed with the ALERT application software.  Depending on access to the Department Wide Area Network, users connect via the WAN or utilize dial-in capabilities.  Future solutions may entail use of Virtual Private Networks (VPN) for secured connections via the Internet.  The solution we may deploy would need to be supportable on our present and future system architecture; however, we will not preclude any technological tools should they present an innovative tool that merits consideration in this initiative.  
	
	Background: ALERT is a decision support management system built around the retailer management and compliance requirements of the Food Stamp Program.  The primary purpose is to load and analyze food stamp transactional data, e.g., food stamp purchases in any of 150,000 authorized food stamp retailer locations.  Data is submitted to FNS by State EBT processors each month.   Only a few States remain to be implemented, the largest being California.  At present, there are nearly 70 million transactions processed monthly and a rolling 6 months of data is maintained on-line.  When all states have implemented EBT, monthly transaction data is estimated to be about 85 million transactions.  Key elements of each electronic transaction are extracted by the EBT processors and provided to the ALERT system.  This data includes information such as dollar amount, location, terminal ID, date and time of the transaction, type of entry (card swiped through a reader or manually key –entered), and whether a paper voucher was issued.
	
	Business Requirements: FNS is looking for technology and analytic tools that can enhance the current system functionality.  The FNS preference is that the system architecture is web and server based.  The system must be accessible to a user base of over 600 local and remote users that are accessing data for inquiry, query, and download.  Users currently access the system via a wide area network or through dial-up access.  Any proposed solution should be able to offer the following:  
¨	Ability to identify evolving trends in suspect retailer behavior as they change.
¨	Allow for ad hoc query capabilities
¨	Identify possible relationships that either enhance existing scans and pattern analysis or support the overall retailer management and integrity goals of FNS.
¨	Support set pattern analysis within the FNS systems environment.

There is considerable latitude for the range of proposed solutions.  These could include COTS solutions, improvement of existing methodologies, or some new technology.  The proposed solution is desired to be compatible with existing and planned systems architecture within FNS.  However, should a solution not be compatible with said architecture, yet otherwise possess merit and benefit to accomplishing the objectives of FNS, it will be considered.

Future Considerations:  The existing data analysis being performed within ALERT has undergone limited revision since its inception.  The current requirements for data being received from the EBT processors have not been altered since the system was initiated in 1996/1997.  There is additional information within the transaction data being collected by the EBT processors that may be of use to FNS, such as telephone nodes or card replacements.  Consequently, new data elements may be added in the future to the transaction records being received from the EBT processors.  Potential solutions being recommended by the vendor community should take this into consideration.

Responses:  Vendors interested in responding to this RFI need to submit a capability statement that clearly and convincingly identifies their capabilities.  In addition, potential vendors must substantiate their capability with the following supplemental information: methodology, technical data, design, brochures, product names, etc.  If these items are available under a GSA schedule, please provide the contract schedule and information.  All responses must be received no later than 11:00am (local time) Monday, September 22, 2003.  Responses must be submitted to the following address:  USDA/FNS/ASD/CMB, Tina M Nevitt Contracting Officer, 3101 Park Center Drive Room 228, Alexandria, VA   22302-1500.  Your response shall not exceed 15 single sided pages, plus supplemental information.  You are required to include an electronic copy in Microsoft Word or a compatible format (Adobe PDF).

<DESC>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS FOR NATIVE AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURS.  Two FINAL questions and answers are set forth below.

Q26.  Can the dollars from a project be used for matching fundings for other grants or programs?  If so, should that be provided for in the proposal?

A26.  Although this procurement is not a grant, we know of no restrictions on what you propose.  Funding arrangements are one of the requirements of the RFP and should therefore be described.

Q27.  A tribe has been awarded funds from another Federal agency for a project.  If an offer were submitted under this solicitation and it was accepted, could SBA conceivably offer the tribe some or all of the cash match necessary to complete the project?

A27.  This type of arrangement would be considered (also see A26 above).  The amount needed for the match would be the amount proposed for your project in this solicitation.

THE PROPOSAL DUE DATE REMAINS UNCHANGED AT SEPTEMBER 16, 2003 AT 4:00PM.

We will assume that the Sony Walkman GVD1000 or equivalent is to be installed in the aforementioned Pelican waterproof case; thus, not requiring a separate waterproof case. Would you please describe what you mean by "installed"? As an example, do you mean rigidly mounted with machined mounts that are riveted to the case or do you simply mean placed in a custom foam insert? Furthermore, do you desire the other items mentioned in this system to be placed in individual zippered weatherproof bags with a custom foam insert in the case or do you have another idea?  ANSWER 2.  A custom foam insert will meet the requirement.  See also NOTE in amendment 001.  -- QUESTION 3. What Sony model video digital camcorder do you wish to use as a baseline comparison? We understand your optical requirements; however, each of these camcorders have a variety of other characteristics that may be of interest. Furthermore, if you are mainly looking for all of the features of the camcorder camera portion, we currently offer that in a small 300x zoom model with 680,000 pixels that is approximately 2" x 2.25" x 3.6" (color to black and white with removable IR cut filter, auto focus and all of the other capabilities that you would find in a Sony video digital camcorder. This small module could then interface with any digital or analog recorder. This model could be remotely controlled by wired or wireless means.  ANSWER 3.  See amendment 001. -- QUESTION 4. Do you desire the 2.5" display to be attached or separate from the camcorder?  ANSWER 4.  Separate. -- QUESTION 5. Is the color pinhole 3.6mm camera a board camera configuration or do you wish to have a micro-camera with removable lenses? Regarding the same camera, you reference cables; please define your requirement of cables.  ANSWER 5.  The minimum requirement is for a board.

<DESC>NA The United States Air Force, Human Resources Directorate, Wright-Patterson AFB,  Ohio, is seeking potential sources to develop additional capabilities for its  Human Resources Integrated Database (HR IDB) or to provide existing software  tools that would provide these capabilities.  Capabilities required include  comprehensive organization charts and "management level" tools and reports that  become an integral part of and use the data stored in the HR IDB, a web-based  application currently using ORACLE and Microsoft .NET. 	a.  The organization charts must encompass a variety of options to  include, but not necessarily limited to:  basic wiring diagrams, comprehensive  listings showing people and positions in each organization and its  subordinates, and summary counts of faces and spaces by officer, enlisted, and  civilians at the various organizational levels for both current and planned  organizational structures.  See attached examples. 	b.  Management level tools involve development of standard, easy to  understand, reports and analysis tools that allow managers at various levels to  see organizational demographics in summary form (e.g., pie/bar charts, tables,  etc.) at the touch of a button, as well as the capability to drill down to more  detailed data in the various categories. The Air Force anticipates eventually conducting a competitive acquisition for  this award.  Any development effort is required to be completed by September  2004. All interested firms shall submit a written explanation of their existing  software tool or similar past development work that demonstrates the capability  to produce said organization charts and/or management level tools within the  necessary timeframe.  These descriptions must be received NLT 30 Sep 2003 and  should include a rough cost estimate or not-to-exceed cost.  The Air Force  anticipates $100,000 to $400,000 possibly being made available for this effort  in FY04.  Where possible, the Air Force will request a demo of the contractor’s  product.  Entries shall be submitted to Jennifer Spoores, 2Lt, Bldg 11A, 1970  WPAFB OH  45433-7208.  Her e-mail address is Jennifer.Spoores@wpafb.af.mil.   She may also be reached at 937-255-4408. Firms responding should indicate whether they are, or are not, a small  business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, or a woman-owned  business.  All interested firms shall submit information demonstrating their  capabilities to perform the work herein described.  The general definition of a  small business is one that is independently owned and operated, is not dominant  in the field of operation in which it is proposing on Air Force contracts and  with its affiliates, and does not have annual receipts exceeding $18.0M.  The  Air Force reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon  responses hereto.  Small business respondents should provide a statement of  capabilities to assist the Air Force in making a set-aside decision.   Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a foreign- owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national  employees on this effort. Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is  voluntary.  The Air Force does not intend to award a contract on the basis of  this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.   Respondents should not construe this synopsis as a commitment by the Air Force  for any purpose.

All responsible sources to submit a proposal will be considered by this agency.  Following is the Statement Of Work. SCOPE OF WORK DEPLOYMENT OF THE FLOODPLAIN INVENTORY APPLICATION TOOL BACKGROUND The Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources Implementation Studies and Corps of Engineer planning regulations require Corps district offices to estimate with and without-project expected annual damages to determine the benefits of flood damage reduction projects.  A portion of these benefits accrues from reduction in damages to commercial structures and their contents.  Corps district offices typically apply de pth-damage functions to determine the amount of damage as a percentage of the structure or content value in one-foot increments.  Corps regulations further require district offices to make assessments of percent damage functions based on either area-specif ic surveys or survey of comparable floodplains that reflect similar hydrologic and building characteristics.  However, district offices are rarely equipped with the necessary financial resources or personnel for doing the expensive and time-consuming surve ys required for producing these damage functions.  Developing default content and structure depth-damage functions for use by the Districts has been identified as a way of reducing the costs and time of studies.  The Flood Damage Data Collection Program is  an ongoing activity focused on using actual flood damage information to estimate flood losses and to develop automated approaches to apply that information.  The Corps of Engineers Floodplain Inventory Tool (CEFIT) is a computer application contains 960 d epth-damage functions for residential structures.  Damages are estimated for 16 inundation levels, based on foundation type, structure style, number of stories, and exterior wall construction.  Additionally, the program has developed a floodplain inventory  tool that allows the user to enter specific building characteristics.  The tool then calculates depreciated structure and content values and depth-damage calculations.  Assumptions regarding depth-damage functions have been premised on component-based est imates of repair costs.  An expert panel of experienced flood damage inspectors has reviewed the major assumptions in the original model related to quantity and value of items in a household inventory, the structural elements that are likely to be damaged and their repair costs, and the content items that are like to be damaged or destroyed and the costs for repair or replacement.  Work of the expert panel has been incorporated in the model, enabling the Institute for Water Resources to test the results and  the validity of the CEFIT model.  To operate successfully the model must be populated with the most recent costs and repair data.  Any proprietary data must be licensed to all Corps offices that would be using the data. OBJECTIVE This work effort will provide populating and licensing of data for a working floodplain inventory tool that provides residential structure and content valuations and associated -damage calculations with uncertainty for import to the Hydrologic Engineering CenterÃ¢Â€Â™s Flood Damage Analysis program.  The contract is also to provide commercial structure and content value for use in Corps of Engineers flood damage reduction studies. APPROACH AND SCOPE The Contractor will populate current the Corps of Engineers Floodplain Inventory Tool with residential structure value estimation data for estimating depreciated replacement costs, content value estimation data, and repair databases for estimating for remo val, cleaning, repair, and replacement.  It is intended that these data be updated every two years and licensed annually.  The Contractor will perform all necessary testing to insure that the software reliably receives and exports data and remains function al on personal computers with Windows 95 or higher operating systems. TASKS AND OUTPUT Task One Participate in a Half-Day Meeting:  The Contractor will participate in a one-day meeting to review the requirements for the deliverables. Task Two Populate the Content Value, Structure Damage, and Content Damage Data Tables in the CEFIT Model and Supply User Documentation: The Contractor will incorporate all necessary and the most recent versions of data to enable CEFIT to calculate residential structure values. The database updates will be consistent with the price levels currently in use for construction costs, household content values, and structural repair costs.  Costs will be itemized by building component for removal, cleaning,  repair, and replacement.  The Contractor will also provide a brief userÃ¢Â€Â™s documentation that will illustrate the step-by-step process for data entry, importing data, calculation, and exporting results from CEFIT to the HEC-Flood Damage Analysis progr am.   Task Three Submit Revised and Updated Software and Site Licenses for 45 Users and Provide Technical Support The Contractor will provide the revised and updated software package ready for installation on a Windows 95 operating system as a runtime application or as Access 2000 database application.  Forty-five copies of the application will be submitted on read-on ly CD ROMs.  The CD ROMs will include and be licensed for residential structure repair and replacement data, a residential value estimator software package for estimating depreciated replacement values for all states and U.S. territories, a commercial soft ware package for estimating depreciated replacement values for all states and U.S. territories, and a software package for estimating commercial content values. The Contractor will supply technical support via telephone for the duration of the license peri od. TASKS	MILESTONES Task One: Participate in a Half-Day Meeting	Within 10 Days of Notice to Proceed Task Two: Populate the Content Value, Structure Damage, and Content Damage Data Tables in the CEFIT Model and Supply User Documentation	Within 30 Days of Notice to Proceed Task Three: Submit Revised and Updated Software and Site Licenses for 45 Users and Provide Technical Support	Within 45 Days of Notice to Proceed
