<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number means the number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the SAM database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor's CAGE code is in the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process.</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It includes-</p>
<p>(1)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Data collected from prospective federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Prospective contractor submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The list of all parties suspended, proposed for debarment, debarred, declared ineligible, or excluded or disqualified under the nonprocurement common rule by agencies, Government corporations, or by the Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p>(b)(1) The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.</p>
<p>(3) If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in CCR may be required in lieu of SAM.</p>
<p>(c) If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) A contractor may obtain a DUNS number-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at <a href="http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform">http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform</a> or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business name.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company physical street address, city, state and Zip Code.</p>

<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) Reserved.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time for registration in SAM, which normally takes five business days, should be taken into consideration when registering.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is ''not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) For long-term contracts--</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
