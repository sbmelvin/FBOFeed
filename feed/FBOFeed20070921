JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FOOD SERVICE EQUIPMENT FOR SOUTHERN EAGLE DINING FACILITY

I.	CONTRACTING ORGANIZATION:  The contracting organization responsible for this action is the 4th Contracting Squadron, 1695 Wright Brothers Avenue, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC, 27531.

II.	DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  The contractual action is a Brand-Name Firm-Fixed Price Contract for the purchase of food service equipment for the 4th Services Squadron.

III.	DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  The required purchase for one (1) Hobart Food Slicer, one (1) Hobart Buffalo Chopper Food Cutter, one (1) True  Sandwich Unit, one (1) Hatco Toaster, one (1) True Reach-In Refrigerator, one (1) Vulcan Hart Deep Fat Fryer and two (2) Vulcan Hart Double Stack Ovens.  One (1) pallet jack and four (4) stainless steel utility carts are the only ?Or Equal? Items.

IV.	AUTHORITY:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1(c).

V.	APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY:  Request to compete this brand name requirement due to the fact that the items listed above have been proven to outlast other makes and models. This equipment is used on a daily basis and other equipment cannot hold up to the rigors of continuous use.  Past experience and testing of other equipment has proven that other brands do not provide the quality for a normal five year life expectancy that is needed to compete for future Air Force Hennessey Awards. Additionally, local maintenance contractors only service these types of brand-name equipment and other equipment would cause the AF to look outside the local area for repairs.  Purchase of other types of equipment will result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered through full and open competition.

VI.	EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: Market research via CCR and telephonic conversations with three (3) companies (Valiant Equipment, BRESCO Inc, and Hobart Equipment) revealed that they are capable and interested.  A notice of the Government?s intent to award a Brand Name contract will be publicized via the Federal Business Opportunities website as required by FAR Part 5.2, 6.302-1(c), and 11.105.

VII.	FAIR AND REASONABLE COST:  Based on the above and in accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a)(1) the Government expects to receive competitive quotations or offers.  

VIII.	MARKET SURVEY:  See paragraph VI above.

IX.	OTHER FACTS: Hobart Service Center in Kinston North Carolina offers and guarantees 24 hour maintenance service on all Hobart and Vulcan Hart products regardless of where the items are purchased. This service allows the 4th Services Squadron to continue its award winning service for the men and women of the 4th Fighter Wing.   

X.	INTERESTED SOURCES:  See paragraph VI above.                                                                  

XI.	STEPS TO FOSTER COMPETITION:  See paragraph VI above.

XII.	TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS/PERSONNEL CERTIFICATION: The using activity has certified that the technical requirements are complete and accurate.

XIII.	CONTRACTING OFFICER?S CERTIFICATION: The Contracting Officer?s signature on the Justification Review Document represents certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge.

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR  6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. See Note(s) 26.    The United State (U.S.) Government intends to purchase the Unlimited Legal Rights to the engineering and technical data contained in the Interface Control Drawings (ICD) for M61 family of gun systems and related equipment. All technical data is intended for internal and external use and competition actions by the U.S Government.  The ICD will portray and explain all critical phases and constraints of the successful handling of 20MM ammunition throughout M61 family guns and related systems. The ICD will define a status for the F-15, F-16, F/A-18, F/A-22, and Mark-15 CIWS gun systems that employ the M61 family of guns.  Using these documents as a reference, engineers will be able to understand every aspect of handling 20mm ammunition thus minimizing the probability of interference issues in the years to come. At this time, according to the most current market research, General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products (GD-ATP) is only known source to the U.S. Government which owns the most current technical drawings that could satisfy the requirement describe above.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION: 

The systems being purchased are to augment the two systems that AFRL/VS purchased earlier this year from the same source - GPS Silicon Valley. The same systems are required to ensure data gathered on the ionosphere from different locations worldwide are compatible and comparable with each other. To use any other products would create compatibility issues and jeopardize continuing research efforts.

NOTE: (1)	The I-9 must be provided before a badge will be issued for unclassified contract work, for access to the shipyard. (2)	If the contract requires access to classified material, a visit request identifying the employees clearance status may suffice depending on the employees status within the JPAS database. (3)	In the case of contractor truck drivers, knowing some are owner operators, if they are carrying proof of citizenship they can be issued a badge for access to drop off/pick up material. (4)	If the truck driver does not have sufficient documentation and the sponsor is willing to escort the driver to/from the desired location, a by-escort badge may be issued. VENDORS/CONTRACTORS SHALL FORWARD ALL VISIT REQUESTS ON THEIR COMPANY LETTERHEAD SIGNED BY AN AUTHORIZED COMPANY OFFICER. Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States. By so stating, the vendor/contractor is certifying that they have positive documentation of that persons citizenship on file (i.e. a signed and verified EEVF I-9 form). The request shall also state the specific reason for the visit request and the specific date(s) for which they are requesting access to Norfolk Naval Shipyard (i.e., date of delivery).

IF THE PERSON FOR WHOM THE VENVOR/CONTRACTOR IS REQUESTING A BADGE WAS BORN IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY, THAT PERSON SHALL BRING POSITIVE DOCUMENTATION OF UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP TO THE NORFOLK NAVAL SHIPYARD PASS OFFICE IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANY LETTER. The additional documentation can be a birth certificate, passport or other official military documentation of United States citizenship. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated. If the person for whom the vendor/contractor is requesting a badge is a naturalized United States citizen, that person SHALL BRING THEIR ORIGINAL NATURALIZATION papers with them to the pass office in addition to the aforementioned company letter. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated.

<ARCHDATE>11062007
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Matthew Growney, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2029
<DESC>NAICS Code: 221112   Under the authority of  FAR 13.106-1(b), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Suburban Propane for the delivery of up to 6,000 gallons of propane for a maximum potential period of three years. This requirement is for  the delivery of propane gas to the EPA facility in Edison, New Jersey.  The EPA maintains a greenhouse at its Edison facility to support plant-related research.  This greenhouse must be heated to assure the temperature within the greenhouse does not fall below 60 degrees F.  The contractor shall  periodically monitor and refill the storage tank to ensure a continuous fuel supply for essential heating.  The contractor shall provide, on a periodic basis, up to 6,000 gallons for the Base year and each of the 2 following optional year periods if the optional terms are exercised.  This notice  is not a request for quotations.   EPA's market research activities indicate that Suburban Propane is the only source reasonably available to satisfy this requirement based on the fact that Suburban currently has a storage tank installed at the EPA facility and removal and reinstallation of a tank  from another vendor would add a significant expense.  In addition, Suburban is the only local vendor known to be willing to price propane at a fixed rate for the maximum potential duration of this order.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This procurement will be  accomplished under FAR Part 12, Commercial Acquisition Procedures. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond.  Documentation must be received by October 6, 2007 in order to be considered by the EPA.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed  contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to  Matthew J. Growney by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail growney.matthew@epa.gov to receive consideration for this contract. Telephone responses will not be honored.

Outstart is the sole proprietary owner of the Evolution LCMS software and as such, has produced and owns the programming code.  Outstart personnel are the only source which can provide software maintenance, training and technical support services for Evolution LCMS software.  In 2009, the Navy intends to research alternative solutions for the fulfillment of Next-generation ILE (NILE) requirements.  This could lead to the development or acquisition of a solution other than an LCMS, or a new LCMS.  The Navy estimates it will take approximately thirty-six months from NILE solution identification to NILE migration and implementation.  The Navy intends for the NILE to be operational in December 2012.  The maximum length of the proposed LCMS contract will be 5 years, comprised of a one-year base with four one-year options.  The speed of NILE solution identification, migration and implementation will influence contract length.  This is not a request for quotation, nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.  The resulting contract will be firm fixed priced and negotiations will be conducted using other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Pursuing award through competition would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling critical mission requirements, potentially leading to the nonavailability of the LCMS.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 511210 with a size standard of $23M.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Commanding Officer's quarters was designated Quarters A. The other building, Quarters B, was home to the civil engineer and other naval officers. Naval personnel const ructed the buildings and the furniture for the Commanding Officer's home came from the decommissioned gunboat Pawnee. The house was renovated in 1887 employing a labor force from the island's African-American residents. In 1889, the piazzas were extended, the roof was tinned and an additional room built. By late 1889 the naval station was in working order and was opened under the command of Lieutenant Charles H. Lyman, USN, who took up residence in the quarters.

<DESC>Office of Naval Research (ONR)Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)
for Payload Implosion and Platform Damage Prediction and Validation Implosion is the sudden inward collapse of a pressure resistant structure. For example, a submerged pressure housing with an internal pressure well below the ambient sea pressure may fail due to the external pressure. Following the collapse, a strong pressure wave is radiated into the surrounding fluid. This pressure wave depends sensitively on the exact form of the collapse. The resulting energetic pressure pulse can potentially damage nearby structures. 

The Navy requires an improved capability to design and qualify submarine external payloads for implosion avoidance and platform survivability. Validated, user-friendly tools are required that enable the designer to predict implosion effects, especially the magnitude of the resulting shock waves: In particular, the Navy needs 1) a parametric payload design tool for conventional payloads, and 2) a physics-based model for complex analyses. This requires both algorithm and software development, and carefully controlled measurements to validate the software.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS
Project Title:  2nd Floor Courtroom Renovation
Location:  Sidney L. Christie Federal Building, 845 Fifth Avenue, Huntington, WV 25701
Solicitation Number:  GS-03P-07-CD-C-0062

Provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for renovation of existing 2nd floor courtroom.  The construction firm will be required to include existing finishes which are painted plaster walls, gypsum wall board ceiling, and carpet floors over original cork flooring on poured in place concrete.  The courtroom has significant standing and running stained ornamental trim, fixed bench seating, and guard rail.  The ceiling has ornamental dentil plaster molding and trim throughout.  Further work includes modification to juror box and associated window treatments, HVAC, and lighting.  Lastly, the work also includes providing an empty conduit system for audio and video systems.

Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.   Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, management and key personnel qualifications, technical and organizational approach, and on their price proposals.

The acquisition shall consist of four (4) phases:  Phase 1 ? Receipt and evaluation of technical offers and of initial price proposals.  Phase 2 ? Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms.  In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not it will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors on the basis of GSA's opinion.  GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3.  Phase 3 ? A determination of the competitive range shall be developed by the Contracting Officer.  Phase 4 ? Completion of negotiations with firms in the competitive range, if necessary.  Receipt and evaluation of final proposal revisions.  

Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price.  The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 3, without negotiations.  The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  1. Past Performance, 2. Management and Key Personnel Qualifications, and 3. Technical and Organizational Approach.  The NAICS code applicable to this project is 236220.  The construction range for this project is estimated between $250,000 and $500,000.  This unrestricted procurement is being conducted under full and open competitive provisions in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The purpose of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program is to assess the ability of small businesses to compete successfully in certain industry categories without competition being restricted by the use of small business set-asides.  This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Central Region, Water Resources Division, New Mexico District, has a requirement to acquire water pump operation, removal and installation services.  The USGS in cooperation with the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority (ABCWU) plan to sample water in well Yale 2.  The existing turbine pump must be removed and stored while a submersible pump is lowered into the well in its place, along with a tube that will be used for insertion of the sampling equipment.  After sampling is complete, the turbine pump must be reinstalled.  Procedures to prevent bacterial contamination during the performance of the contract must be in place. The U.S. Geological Survey considers this specified requirement as a sole source to Alpha Southwest Inc., 205 Rossmoor Rd SW, Albuquerque, NM 87105.  Due to the critical nature of this resource, ABCWU will only allow their certified contractor access to this well.  Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these products at the same cost may submit a capabilities statement to the contracting officer USGS, PO BOX 25046, MS 204, Denver Federal Center, Denver, CO 80225-0046 no later than the closing date of this requirement (09/27/2007) 4:PM MST.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist; if no submissions are received by the above appointed time, the Government will proceed with a noncompetitive award after funds have been appropriated for this requirement.  This is NOT a request for a quote (RFQ); the Government does not anticipate a written solicitation.

<DESC>The Department of the Air Force intends to issue a sole source delivery order under the terms of ATK GASL's GSA schedule for upgrdes to an existing JP-7 Fuel Heater. This upgrade consists of modifications to the existing waste recovery system, valves, plumbing, cabling, software and instrumentation.  The equipment to be modified is used to heat JP-7 fuel through thin wall inconel tubes using 3.5 MW of power. The JP-7 endothermic fuel is heated to 1300 degrees Farenheit, which is above its auto-ignition temperature. ATK GASL is the only source known to have the proprietary design data and experience necessary to make the required modifications.  Other interested firms may respond to this synopsis by furnishing detailed technical data documenting the capability to perform this work. If no affirmative responses are received by 28 September 2007, the Air Force intends to proceed with negotiations with ATK GASL under the terms of their GSA schedule.

<DESC>Request for Information (NNH07ZDA004R): Earth and Space Science Payloads on the International Space Station RFI Issued: September 21, 2007 Response Due Date: October 12, 2007 The NASA Science Mission Directorate requests information on potential small Earth and space science payloads that could be deployed on the International Space Station (ISS). NASA is interested in (i) potential investigations for ISS-utilization in the post-2010 timeframe and (ii) the identification of experiments that are essentially ready-to-go and could be launched to the ISS in 2009 or 2010. In both cases, NASA is only interested in investigations, payloads, and/or experiments that contribute to NASA's science objectives in Earth and space science. This information will be used to inform NASA's program planning, including consideration of whether to solicit ISS-attached payloads in its Earth and Space Science program. NASA has determined that there may be payload opportunities for small Earth and space science payloads to be attached to the International Space Station. Available external attach points include both zenith and nadir pointing locations. NASA has available launch opportunities in 2009 and 2010 on the Space Shuttle and annual launch opportunities after 2010 on the Japanese HTV launch vehicle. The NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has issued this Request for Information (RFI) to survey the Earth and space science community for potential science investigations and small payloads that can take advantage of the International Space Station. External accommodations for payloads include Express Logistics Carriers (ELCs) mounted to the ISS truss structure, the Japanese Experiment Module-Exposed Facility (JEM-EF) and the Columbus Orbiting Facility-Exposed Facility (COF-EF). Internal accommodations for smaller instruments are also available in the pressurized environment via the Window Observational Research Facility (WORF). The response to this RFI will be in the form of a PDF document that is uploaded through NASA's NSPIRES system. The response should not exceed three pages in length. NASA is soliciting information that might be used by NASA to facilitate planning for science utilization of the ISS.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis announcements are issued to assist the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) in performing market research to determine industry interest and capability, obtain company demographics, benchmarking information and industry ideas for an acquisition approach.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is not a request for proposal and at this time, no solicitation exists.

Introduction:  The Agency's mission is to safeguard the United States and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) by providing capabilities to reduce, eliminate and counter the threat and its effects.  This mission dictates a diverse set of customers and unique mission requirements.  The Agency's Information Technology (IT) requirements are therefore equally diverse and unique.  DTRA is seeking interested sources capable of providing integrated IT services and support for the DTRA IT environment. 

Background:  The DTRA Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for ensuring that IT capabilities are acquired and information resources are managed and maintained in a manner that supports the Agency's mission consistent with Federal and Department of Defense guidance.  This entails developing, maintaining, and operating an integrated set of IT capabilities, services and processes across all functional areas of the Agency.  IT support requirements within DTRA are extremely diverse, ranging from office automation and business/mission system support to sensor integration.  

In the past, the broad range and diversity of the Agency IT support requirements, in addition to other factors, led to a "stovepiped" and fractured IT infrastructure.  The CIO, teamed with the DTRA IT support contractor(s), is committed to developing the necessary governance, processes and oversight required to effectively integrate IT services across the Agency.

DTRA recently consolidated the majority of its personnel and IT infrastructure within the Defense Threat Reduction Center (DTRC) located at Fort Belvoir, VA.  The current infrastructure provides IT services and support for over 2400 employees and contractors.  In addition to the DTRC facility, IT services are provided to several smaller field offices in the National Capitol region, eight Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) remote sites within the U.S., the DTRA Albuquerque office and four overseas offices.

The DTRA IT infrastructure encompasses three principal security domains: Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU), Secret, and Top Secret/ Sensitive Compartmental Information (TS/SCI).  In addition, the CIO supports numerous mission and business systems in addition to collaboration capabilities.

Requirements:   DTRA intends to acquire services and support for its IT environment from a contractor(s).  The Agency requires the provider(s) to integrate the current IT environment into a centrally managed enterprise system capable of providing 24/7/365 IT functional support to all DTRA facilities, both CONUS and OCONUS along with providing built-in capabilities to address future enhancement, modernization and technology changes.  Potential sources will be required to satisfy organizational conflict of interest requirements.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-DMAFB_WTE
<RESPDATE>100507

<CONTACT>Arthur Perry, Contract Specialist, Phone 520-228-2213, Fax 520-228-5462, Email arthur.perry@dm.af.mil
<DESC>This action is a Request for Information Only.  The Government does not presently intend to contract, but wants to obtain a list of interested parties and general information regarding anticipated Waste-to-Energy (WTE) technologies, plant size (MW), capital cost range; feed stock; tons per day (TPD), and electricity cost per kilowatt-hour (kwh).  

Davis-Monthan Air Force Base (DMAFB) is interested in knowing if there are parties interested in developing a Waste-to-Energy (WTE) plant on DMAFB property as part of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).  The DMAFB energy profile is as follows: a baseload of  8 MW; a 2 MW summertime increase; and a summertime peak load of 21 MW.  DMAFB consumes 100 million kWh per year, and is currently enrolled in the Tucson Electric Power (TEP) rate plan titled Large Light & Power Rate 14 (Minimum Demand = 3,000 kW).  DMAFB has a 10+ acre site available on-base with access to surface roads and potential access to railway.  The Arizona Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff (REST) became effective 14 August 2007 and REST Surcharge Tariff applications must be filed with the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) by 14 October 2007.  Be aware that TEP filed a rate case with the ACC on 02 July 2007 and rates could increase an average of 15 to 23 percent by 01 Jan 2009.  The TEP rate case is not yet settled.

DMAFB needs to know:
1) The anticipated WTE technology (incineration, gasification, or plasma arc);
2) The anticipated WTE plant size (MW);
3) The anticipated capital cost range ($25 - $50 million; $50 - $75 million; $75 - $100 million; $100 million to $125 million; $125 million to $150 million; etc.);
4) The anticipated feed stock:  Municipal Solid Waste; Biomass; Tires; etc.;
5) The anticipated tons per day: 250 to 350 TPD; 350 to 500 TPD; 500 to 750 TPD; 750 to 1000 TPD; etc.;
6) The anticipated electricity cost per kwh: $0.05 to $0.10/kwh; $0.10 to $0.15/kwh; $0.15 to $0.20/kwh; $0.20 to $0.25/kwh; $0.25 to $0.30/kwh; $0.30 to $0.35/kwh; etc.

The incentive for DMAFB to locate renewable energy on base property includes the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and Executive Order 13423, Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice (Notice) and Request for Information (RFI).  No solicitation is available.  This Notice and RFI is released pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry.

The US Census Bureau (Census Bureau) issues this Notice and RFI regarding fingerprinting equipment capable of processing large volumes of Decennial applicant fingerprints, within restricted timeframes.

A.  Background

The Census Bureau, Administrative Management Systems Division (AMSD), Census Hiring and Employment Check Branch (CHEC), is responsible for processing requests for criminal background checks on current Survey (Schedule A) employees, Respondents, career appointees and Special Sworn Status employees.  This responsibility includes background check processing for the temporary employees hired to conduct decennial census pretests and for the Census itself.  The scope of the hiring effort is very large. During the peak hiring period for the 2000 Decennial Census, the Census Bureau conducted screenings on 3.7 million applicants, prior to selection and subsequent hiring of nearly 1 million employees.

The Census Bureau seeks to procure live scan fingerprinting equipment in support of recruiting and hiring of applicants for the 2010 Census.   In the late 1990s, the FBI introduced the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFS) but found that it was unable to handle the large volume of decennial fingerprints.

B.  Operations Concept

The envisioned system concept is a single unit offering an operationally feasible method of screening large volumes of applicants within restricted timeframes. It is to be assumed that the system will be used in the following ways. New hires will be fingerprinted during their first day of training. There will be approximately 413,000 people to be fingerprinted the first day of non-response follow-up for the Decennial.  Adequate live scan equipment will be acquired to accommodate the largest number of back-to-back training sessions.  During each training session there will be at least 1 live scan (government employed) operator, along with backup equipment.  During the lifecycle of the operation, approximately 1 million employees will have been fingerprinted. 

C.  Potential Requirements

An envisioned system would meet the following requirements:
 
1)	The live-scan system (the ?device?) must provide an easy-to-use and easily transportable capability to collect forensic quality fingerprint images and create standard fingerprint records.

a.	The government prefers that the complete system be a single integrated unit consisting of a laptop computer and ?4-4-2? plain impression fingerprint scanner.

b.	 The fingerprint scanner component must be capable of capturing plain impression finger print images of the two thumbs simultaneously, and of the four fingers of either hand (4-finger ?slap? print).

c.	The fingerprint imaging components must capture and digitize distortion-free fingerprint images at a spatial resolution of not less than 500 dpi in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions, and with 8-bit (256-level) per pixel gray-scale quantization.

A contract for a Queuing system will be awarded to Q-matic Corporation following no response back to this notice of intent.  The purchase of a queuing system for the PharmaCare center must be done through Q-Matic Corporation because they are the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This is a replacement of a portion of a system that includes SW, HW signage, database and cabling which are proprietary and are exclusive to the Q-MATIC system.  The Q-MATIC solution is the only system available that will integrate with the existing customer flow management infrastructure, including the low voltage electrical lines, data lines, signage and database structure.  The Q-MATIC system will support virtually all ODBC compliant datase types, and has the ability to transfer customers from one Q-MATIC system location to another through the LAN/WAN as Q-MATIC is used throughout the base for the other pharmacies as well as other hospital systems.  Q-MATIC also has a large U.S. support organization that provides 24-hour helpdesk support 7 days a week, highly trained technicians located throughout the country to provide timely, onsite support and a skilled Project Management Team to coordinate all installation activity.     

Market research was conducted for the purchase of this queuing system and Q-MATIC Corporation is the only contractor found able to supply this item as we require. If no response to this notice is received by 3:00pm EST on Thursday, September 27, 2007, the award for this queuing system for the PharmaCARE building will be made to Q-MATIC Corporation.

Malaria Advisor/Program Manager  
Accra, Ghana


SOLICITATION NUMBER 641-07-011

SOLICITATION NUMBER: 641-07-011
ISSUANCE DATE: September 21, 2007 
CLOSING DATE/TIME: October 21, 2007 
POSITION TITLE:  Malaria Advisor/Program Manager
MARKET VALUE: GS 14 ($79,115 - $102,848) 
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 2 years with option to extend for one year 
	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Accra, Ghana
SECURITY ACCESS: Secret
AREA OF CONSIDERATION: USPSC
 

Background:

The health sector in Ghana faces many challenges including stagnating under-five mortality, high maternal and neonatal deaths, high HIV prevalence among most-at-risk groups and lack of access to quality services.  Malaria causes a significant burden of disease and is a key contributor to poverty.  It accounts for over 44 percent of outpatient visits and an estimated 22 percent of mortality for children under age five. In 2005, more than 3 million suspected cases of malaria were seen in government health facilities with over 110,000 patients admitted.  

Ghana has been identified as a US Presidential Malaria Initiative (PMI) focus country beginning in 2008. This will bring significant new resources to the program.  To prepare for the new program, in 2007 USAID will conduct operational research in indoor residual spraying, and community based diagnosis and treatment.  In close collaboration with the MOH and the GHS, USAID/Ghana is currently developing a new malaria strategy that will guide our assistance under this initiative, in close collaboration with CDC and other USG partners. The sub elements will include: improved equitable access to and appropriate use of ACT to treat malaria, including procurement and provision of drugs; improve access and use of ITNs, especially for pregnant women and children under-five through public-private partnerships; expand access and use of intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) with Sulfadoxine Pyrimethanine in order to address malaria in pregnancy. Other interventions will focus on introducing the use of indoor residual spraying to prevent malaria outbreaks; designing and developing of communication messages to promote ACT, ITNs and IPT. 

USAID works with the Ministry of Health, Ghana Health Services  and other Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), other development partners (particularly DfID, UNFPA, UNICEF, WHO, DANIDA), UNAIDS, the Global Fund for HIV/TB/Malaria, and U.S.-based Co-operating Agencies to assure appropriate orientation, coordination and implementation of all USAID-funded support for health activities, including malaria control efforts. The Government of Ghana (GOG) is committed to the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Initiative, supported by the Global Fund (GF) and managed by the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP).  The RBM Initiative strengthens health services and makes prevention and treatment strategies widely available. 

The GF provides $38.2 million to the NMCP to fight malaria.  UNICEF, with funding from the United Kingdom (UK), supports the distribution of free nets during national immunization campaigns and supports a community-based child health strategy including a malaria component in the three northern regions. The World Bank provides small grants for emergency commodity procurement and works with the GOG to develop malaria policies.

The Malaria Consortium, consisting of major health donors, assists the NMCP in implementing their bed net programs. This is funded by the UK, with technical assistance from the World Health Organization and implementation through a network of local NGOs.  With GF resources, Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies are procured for most of the country.

Position Duties and Responsibilities:
The Malaria Advisor/Program Manager, in collaboration with the PMI CDC Technical Advisor, shall provide leadership, guidance and overall direction on the development and execution of the PMI in Ghana. The Malaria Advisor/Program Manager, in collaboration with the PMI CDC Technical Advisor, shall provide managerial and technical support to Ghana?s National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) Director and the staff; and help to build capacity within the NMCP.  
Specific Responsibilities:

1.  Collaborate with senior staff of the NMCP and other partners, such as the Global Fund (GF), WHO, UNICEF, World Bank (WB) and NGOs and FBOs to design, plan and implement malaria prevention and control activities consistent with the malaria control coverage needs identified by the strategy and plans of the NMCP and PMI.

2.  Ensure that all activities are consistent with internationally accepted best practices and relevant to the specific malaria epidemiology of Ghana;

3.  Coordinate with other partners and support efforts to address malaria control delivery gaps and help build technical and managerial capacity within the NMCP at the national, district and lower levels;

4.  Provide technical support to all partners and managerial support as needed during the designing and implementation phases of the project to ensure the quality of interventions supported and that programmatic targets are met;

5.  Work with suppliers and partners to ensure that programmatic commodities are purchased in a timely and cost effective manner. Also, ensure that the absorptive capacity exists in implementation sites to receive, manage and distribute these items effectively. 

6.  Ensure that malaria activities are integrated into overall USAID-supported health activities and to coordinate these activities with the NMCP and MOH to avoid duplication of effort and programming gaps; 

7.  Assist the PMI administrative manager to ensure full accountability and value for money of funds provided by the President?s Initiative on Malaria; 

8.  Assist the NMCP and Ministry of Health (MOH) in ensuring effective communication and coordination between Roll Back Malaria and Global Fund partners, including donor agencies and other stakeholders working on malaria control in Ghana;

9.  Ensure effective coordination between MOH and Ghana Health Services (GHS) departments related to malaria prevention and control in Ghana. These departments include MOH and GHS Senior Management, NMCP, GHS Public Health divisions concerned with Child Health, Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), Reproductive Health, Nutrition, School Health, Health Education and Promotion, Planning, and others as appropriate;

10. Work with the NMCP and other partners to develop and execute a monitoring and evaluation plan to be implemented through existing MOH/GHS systems and existing USG supported mechanisms. Carry out monitoring and evaluation visits to implementation sites to ascertain all quantitative and qualitative data is collected properly and ensure programmatic quality and value for money are maintained. 

12.  Assist PMI administrative manager to ensure that financial and technical
 reports on the President?s Malaria Initiative in Ghana are prepared and submitted as required.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-17.   The purpose of this combined synopsis/solicitation is to acquire an independent study of railroads to respond to a GAO report and to implement GAOs recommendation.  The STB intends to retain a contractor that will provide a team of qualified analysts to assess competition in the U.S. railroad industry. The Government will be available to provide, upon request, technical assistance to the Contractor, but the Contractor will be expected to fully staff and manage the project.  A Fixed Price contract is contemplated for this requirement.  SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECS/WORK STATEMENT - Report to the U.S. STB on Competition and Related Issues in the U.S. Freight Railroad Industry  	C.1.0 Introduction - In October 2006, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released its latest report on the U.S. railroad industry.  GAO found that the industry health has improved, but it expressed concerns over competition and captivity in the railroad industry. GAO recommended that the Surface Transportation Board (STB or Board) conduct a rigorous analysis of the state of competition in the U.S. railroad industry and consider actions to address problems associated with potential abuses of market power. 

In this statement of work the STB seeks to implement GAOs recommendation. The study will focus on competition in the railroad industry and will review and analyze various proposals that might enhance competition.  As part of the analysis, the study will explore the interaction between capacity and competition in the railroad industry. The study also will examine the railroad industrys privately owned capital infrastructure expenditures relative to its overall earnings and how such expenditures compare with such outlays in other capital intensive industries.  NOTE:  The Contractor is to compare the capital requirements of the railroad industry with other industries.  Collection of this information should be considered background information needed to put the railroad industry structure, conduct, and performance into a proper perspective. 

The STB is soliciting proposals for an independent and quality technical analysis from a team of highly skilled researchers. While STB staff will be available to provide technical assistance as specified herein, the STB and its staff will not otherwise be involved in conducting the study or in the formulation of the conclusions and/or recommendations of the report. The STB will make available its Carload Waybill Sample (a very rich data source which we have collected for more than 20 years). The Board also collects and will provide (as needed) detailed operating and financial statistics on the Class I carriers. More broadly, the contractor can rely on the expertise of STB staff for general background information and to assist the contractor to the best of their ability, provided that such assistance does not compromise the independence of the final report.

C.2.0 	Background
In the years following the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, the U.S. railroad industry vastly improved its productivity, profitability, and performance. Rail transportation rates, in both real and nominal terms, declined steadily while freight volumes steadily increased. In the last few years, however, capacity constraints have emerged in key corridors and rates have in some cases increased sharply. The Government believes that changes in railroad rates should reflect the operations of a competitive marketplace and not an abuse of market power. 

The STB believes that capacity and competition are inherently linked and is concerned that the railroads may not be capable of generating the capital resources to provide sufficient capacity to adequately serve the public based on widely available forecasts. This concern led us to initiate Ex Parte 671, Rail Capacity and Infrastructure Requirements. The record developed in that proceeding has strengthened our belief that there is a direct link between railroad capacity and service levels.  A goal of this study is to examine the relationship between known capacity requirements and the railroads ability to meet those needs.  

C.3.0 	Scope  
The STB intends to retain a contractor that will provide a team of qualified analysts to assess competition in the U.S. railroad industry. The Government will be available to provide, upon request, technical assistance to the Contractor, but the Contractor will be expected to fully staff and manage the project.

C.4.0 	Technical Requirements  
The Contracting Officer (CO) will issue the contract for the required report. The designated Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will provide technical assistance as needed.
The Contractor is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract.  The role of the government is quality assurance to ensure contract standards are achieved.  In this contract the quality control program is the driver for product quality.  The contractor is required to develop a comprehensive program of inspections and monitoring actions.  The first major step to ensuring a self-correcting contract is to ensure that the quality control program approved at the beginning of the contract provides the measures needed to lead the contractor to success. Once the quality control program is approved, careful application of the process and standards presented in the remainder of this document will ensure a robust quality assurance program.  

C.4.1 Tasks
The Contractor shall perform the following:
4.1.1	Task 1 - Orientation and Kickoff Meeting  
The purpose of this task is to provide the Contractor team with an adequate knowledge and understanding of the study goals and the regulatory system administered by the Government. 
4.1.1.1. Kick-off Meeting - The project will be initiated with a one-day kick-off meeting to be held in Washington, DC at a location to be provided at time of award.   The Contractor project manager (PM) and necessary technical experts will attend this meeting.  The Government will assist the Contractor in identifying the key sources of data on the railroad industry and review the findings reported in the GAO study. The Government will provide the Contractor with an overview of the statutory obligations and, in particular, the Government need to balance the competing interests delineated in the National Railroad Transportation Policy (49 U.S.C. 10101).
The Contractor will provide an overview of its company Quality Control Program for this type of work.
4.1.2 	Task 2 - Qualitative Research 
The purpose of this task is to conduct in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with shippers, railroad managers, academic experts, consultants, financial analysts, and key Government staff.  In particular, attention is to be focused on the importance of competition, capacity, and regulatory policy as drivers of the industry's performance.  In conducting these interviews, the Contractor shall include in its inquiries topics not limited to:  (1)  competition in the U.S. railroad industry both nationally and in selected geographic markets to be identified; (2) competition for grain, coal, chemical, general merchandise (boxcar) and intermodal movements; and (3) the effects of competition and capacity availability on service quality.  NOTE: Geographic markets have not been selected.  The Government will work with the vendor to identify representative markets for analysis. 

4.1.3	Task 3 - Develop a Methodology to Verify Results Obtained in Task 2
 Armed with the results obtained from Task 2, the Contractor will develop an appropriate analytical methodology to verify the results of its qualitative research.  This methodology must employ techniques from industrial organization and econometrics best suited to verifying the information obtained in Task 2.  The Contractor will report the details of its proposed methodological approach to the STB prior to proceeding with the verification process. The Contractor should highlight how the proposed approach is similar to or different from previous studies of competition in the U.S. railroad industry. The Contractor will explain why the methodological approach it has chosen will provide new insight into the state of railroad competition. Before the Contractor commences work on Tasks 4 and 5, the Government will provide appropriate technical comments on the methodological approach proposed by the Contractor.  
4.1.4	Task 4 - Analyze Competition in the Railroad Industry 
Incorporating the information obtained in Task 2, and relying on the methodology chosen in Task 3, the Contractor will collect and analyze the data needed to complete the competition assessment. Should the Contractor require specific information from the railroads that is not publicly available, the Government will assist the Contractor in collecting that data pursuant to its statutory authority at 49 U.S.C. 721 (b).   
4.1.5	Task 5 - Analyze Capacity and Service Quality in the Railroad Industry 
The Contractor will examine how competition and capacity constraints influence the quality of service provided by rail carriers.  
4.1.6	 Task 6 - Analyze Range of Policy Actions 
The Contractor will evaluate how the policy reforms suggested by GAO would affect the future financial health and stability of U.S. railroads and whether such proposals would stimulate or discourage private investments in the railroad industry. 
4.1.6	Task 7 - Prepare a Final Report 
The Contractor will prepare its final report by November 1, 2008. The contractor will be responsible for printing the report and producing an electronic/CD-Rom/disc production of the final report. The report shall be consistent with the U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual, located on-line at http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/browse.html.
C.4.2 Staffing
The value of the services to be provided to STB by the Contractor will depend heavily on the qualifications and experience of the Project Manager (PM) as well as the qualifications of the members of the PM team of experts. 
To avoid and preclude any appearance of a conflict of interest, the PM nor the Key Personnel (as defined at 4.2.2) will be subject to a conflicts screening.  The PM and Key Personnel must demonstrate that do not have an interest that would bias the results of the study.
4.2.1	Project Manager
The PM should possess the skills and experience needed to manage interdisciplinary teams of the type required for projects of this magnitude and complexity. The PM should also have substantial experience in the preparation of competition assessments. 
4.2.2	Key Personnel
Key personnel are considered essential to the successful performance of this contract.   The Contractor shall obtain and maintain current resumes of those identified for each position or function listed below that will be assigned for this project. Project Manager, Senior Qualitative/Marketing Researcher,	Senior Economist, Senior Econometrician/Statistician
The identified key personnel shall not be reassigned or removed without the written consent of the Contracting Officer unless the identified key personnel become unavailable.  At such time, the contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, within the first day of the unavailability and provide a written justification (including proposed substitutions) in sufficient detail to permit evaluation of the impact on the performance and quality of the contract.  All proposed replacement personnel shall submit to the Contracting Officer a current resume to support that the replacement is comparable to the personnel being replaced.  The Government may amend the key personnel list.  
4.2.3	Other Personnel
The Contractor shall hire only competent personnel to be used in the performance of this contract. By competent, the STB means individuals with the skills, education, and experience needed to complete this report.
C.4.3	Travel with the $35,000 ceiling amount is envisioned to support Task 1 and Task 2.  It is not limited to those categories and could conceivably support the later tasks as well by approving travel requests that support the vendor's ability to complete the research and report.  It is expected that much of the qualitative research can be done in Washington, D.C., where many of the key stakeholders have a presence or can be expected to visit on a regular basis. It is also possible that portions of the qualitative research can be done through phone interviews, surveys, etc., which may also minimize travel time.  - END OF WORK STATEMENT

QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAM (QCP) 
The Contractor shall establish and maintain a complete Quality Control Program to assure that the requirements of the contract are met as specified.  One copy of the Contractor's proposed initial Quality Control Plan shall be provided at the Kickoff meeting as stated in Section C.  The Contractor may be required to submit additional plans, as mutually agreed to by both parties.  The Government will review each plan to insure the successful completion of the project.  The Government must approve each plan within 15 calendar days after receipt.   The QCP shall include, but not be limited to: 1. An inspection system covering the scanning and indexing services as stated in the contract.  A checklist shall be used in inspecting contract performance during regularly scheduled or unscheduled inspections.  2.	The name(s) of the individual(s) who will perform the inspection.  3. A system for identifying and correcting deficiencies in the quality of services before the level of performance becomes unacceptable and/or the Government inspectors point out the deficiencies. 4. A file of all inspections conducted by the Contractor and any corrective actions taken.  This documentation shall be made available to the Government during the term of the contract.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis\solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the the format in FAR subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5 and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is HSFEMS-07-Q-0011 and is issued as a request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-09.  The North American Industry Classification System (NACIS) is 611420 (Computer Training).  The SBA size standard in millions of dollars is 6.5M.  The FEMA Biloxi TRO intends to purchase training in three different software programs as summarized below in the Performance Work Statement (PWS)
Information Technology Performance Work Statement  (PWS)
I.  BACKGROUND: 
          The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) requires IT services in maintaining and enhancing the existing and newly converted Oracle, SQL and Microsoft Applications.  In addition, FEMA requires support for those systems that have not yet been migrated into these environments, but are still in use and still need to be maintained and occasionally modified to support new management directives.  It is important that FEMA has IT staff available for problems, or should changes be required for any of these systems. These systems provide support for critical business processes within FEMA. 
To accomplish disaster activities, FEMA utilizes IT hardware (e.g., personal computers and Windows 2003 Servers) and software (e.g., Oracle, SQL, Microsoft Active Directory etc.) to perform the work.  Training is required to effectively support these new systems.
II.	PURPOSES AND SCOPE: 
The FEMA Enterprise Database Application platform is Oracle 9i/10g.  This includes Oracle Spatial for the Geospatial applications within the agency.  All field Deployable Enterprise Geospatial Suites (DEGS) are installed with Oracle Spatial 10g and ESRI ArcSDE as the middle-ware spatial data engine for Geographic Information Systems (GIS) support to Joint Field Office (JFO) operations.
One of the critical requirements to having a successful response and recovery operations in the JFO is the IT/GIS technical/administrative support.  This platform is very new to the GIS operational management and the IT support to GIS.  There is no in-house training in place to support this application system.
For this cause, we must provide the necessary training to properly equip our IT/GIS staff to successful complete their jobs.  There are also database applications that have been, and are being developed in support of recovery operations in MS Access and SQL formats. However, the Enterprise Architecture (EA) requirements call for Oracle 10g developed applications, so these databases are being redefined around Oracle.  NEMIS is an Oracle 9i suite of database modules that is being migrated to Oracle 10g with Web-based user interfaces.
SQL Server 2005 is needed because it is designed to help provide the highest level of security for enterprise data through features such as database encryption, more secure default settings, password policy enforcement, granular permissions control, and an enhanced security models.
Windows Server 2003 is the new standard operating system used by FEMA to handle a diverse set of server roles, which include: File and print services, Web server and Web application services, Mail services, Terminal server, Remote access and virtual private network (VPN) server, Directory services, Domain Name System (DNS), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, and Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS). 
Active Directory is the new FEMA Windows platform and Active Directory service provides the means to manage the identities and relationships that make up network environments. Windows Server 2003 uses Active Directory to manage migration and deployment.
 APPLICATIONS TRAINING
            Description: 
      The contractor shall provide training to FEMA IT staff in Biloxi, Mississippi.  The contractor shall provide instruction on the functionality of an application.   No more than six training sessions are anticipated for each subject covered and the ideal number is five.. The maximum # of students per training session will be 15.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION 

ITEMS PECULIAR TO ONE MANUFACTURER ? FAR 11.105(a)(1), Brand Name

1.	IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING ACTIVITY

a.	Requiring Agency:  Counter Intelligence Field Activity (CIFA)
b.	Contracting Agency:  CIFA Chief of Staff Acquisition (CIFA-CSA)

2.	NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED

Annual maintenance for CIFA?s Planview Enterprise Project Portfolio Manager and Enterprise Portfolio Manager Software currently being used to support CIFA?s Enterprise Architecture (EA).

Installation and deployment of the software on CIFA?s secure network for production. 
Deployment Planning Services to enhance CIFA?s use of the tool for portfolio management and CIFA?s business processes.
 

3.	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY?S NEEDS/(INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VALUE)

CIFA requires annual maintenance of the Planview portfolio management modules to support CIFA?s Enterprise Architecture. This software enables leadership to better analyze and manage risks, optimize investment opportunities and make informed investment decisions, align resources with business demands, and have visibility into and control of project portfolios. Installation of the software by the vendor will ensure that the software is connected and configured properly from a network and security perspective. The deployment planning services will support CIFA?s development of an implementation strategy for optimizing use of the tool based on CIFA?s business issues calling for a portfolio management solution. The estimated dollar value of the maintenance support is $17,909.00 and for the installation and deployment planning services, the estimated value is $9,672.00.

4.	IDENTIFICATION OF THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

This acquisition of Planview is authorized by FAR 11.105(a), consistent with FAR 6.302-1, and documented per the requirements of FAR 11.105a(1).

5.	A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY

In accordance with FAR 11.105(a)(1), Planview software is required in order for CIFA technical experts to complete ongoing developmental activities; as Planview Portfolio Management modules are currently in use to support CIFA?s Enterprise Architecture. Therefore, it would not be in the best interest of the Government to procure a new software application in place of our currently installed Planview products. Planview?s software and services offerings are only available through Planview, the sole software developer. Similar applications were found to be lacking one or more of the particular required feature(s), did not meet, or could not be modified to meet CIFA?s requirements of form, fit, and function; nor at this time, could they be placed into CIFA?s infrastructure quickly and easily. Adding a new brand of software application into CIFA?s system would result in unacceptable work delays and substantially inflated costs.

6.	A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE      

This requirement will be posted on the Fedbizopps website.  All interested parties can respond to the announcement.

7.	A DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE    

The Contracting Officer will ensure that the anticipated cost will be fair and reasonable through price analysis in accordance with FAR 15.404.


8.	A DESCRIPITION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULT OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED: 

Market research was conducted through GSA e-buy via RFQ223165; of five vendors only one vendor responded with pricing. The combined synopsis solicitation will be posted to Fedbizopps to encourage addition quotations.

9.	ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

CIFA CSA always attempts full and open competition whenever possible; and will continue to do so for future acquisition requirements.

10.	A LISTING OF THE SOURCES THAT EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN THIS ACQUISITION     

Planview Inc.
DLT Solutions, Inc.

11.	A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITOIN 

CIFA-CSA has and continues to exercise competition as often as possible.  CIFA always uses a variety of vendors, manufacturers and sources to maximize competition.  CIFA will continue to practice surveying the market to ensure future full and open competition.

Attachment Brand Name Justification: 
Statutory Authority. Title 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as implemented by FAR 6.302-(1)(c).

Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited. The items under this justification are peculiar to two manufacturers, Sony and Fujinon. AFIT camera equipment has met its life cycle of 5 years and several configuration specific items are in need of an upgrade. At the current time, AFIT has no critical spares on hand. Sony and Fujinon are the only known brands that can meet the current configuration and meet the government requirement without procuring additional equipment. Buying any other brands would result in the government replacing the existing infrastructure at an additional cost of approximately $60,651.20 to include man hours, and possibly more due to training.

Four (4) 55 gallon barrells of Rejex-it Fog Force for Offutt AFB, Nebraska. *NOTE- The repellant must be able to be delivered in 55 gallon drums to economize space and maximize the use of current equipment.   

Brand name justification:
Rejex-it Fog Force bird repellant (available thru several small businesses) is the only brand to meet the government?s requirement. Rejex-it Fog Force is the only bird repellant on the commercial market that can be converted to fog in a thermal fogging machine.  Through transforming the liquid into a fog, allows the chemical to cover a larger area.  It takes about six ounces to cover an acre.  Offutt has over 400 acres to cover so we need twenty plus gallons per application for the entire airfield.

JUSTIFICATION:

The 12th Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB intends to award a contract on a Limited Source Basis to provide Maintenance for handheld, base stations and vehicular mounted radios.  
The Randolph AFB Personal Wireless Communications Systems (PWCS) Office requires continued maintenance warranty coverage on Trunked land mobile radio system infrastructure components and depot maintenance for 368 handheld base stations and vehicular mounted radios.  Currently Motorola?s extended service warranty covers 651 items of radio equipment, which will expire 30 September 07.  An additional 39 radios with manufacturer warranty will expire 10 November 07.  The maintenance coverage for the 690 radios will be Motorola?s standard depot maintenance coverage.  Estimated maintenance coverage for the infrastructure components is $18,405.00 and the estimated cost for depot maintenance coverage is $56,767.00.  Motorola?s U.S. Federal Government Markets Division completed a system design and analysis in June 2000 for Randolph?s Trunked radio system requirements. The system design calls for the eventual integration of Randolph?s Trunked radio equipment with San Antonio Radio Trunking system (SARTS).  Other members of the SARTS include Lackland AFB, Brooks AFB, Fort Sam Houston, Camp Bullis, Wilford Hall Medical Center and Brooke Army Medical Center.  The system design and analysis along with all of the radio equipment used on Randolph?s Trunked radio system is proprietary intellectual property owned by Motorola.   Currently, Randolph has a large inventory of Motorola Trunked radios, parts and accessories that are still covered by Motorola?s factory warranty.  Total investment of Motorola equipment to date exceeds $2.8 million.  As the prime manufacturer, Motorola, Inc hold proprietary data rights to the equipment and has no authorized distributors or service providers to provide depot maintenance.  Any warranty and/or maintenance performed on existing Motorola equipment must be performed by Motorola trained personnel due to proprietary intellectual properties, proprietary data and copyrights to equipment held by Motorola.  Therefore, Motorola is deemed to be the only source that can satisfy agency requirements.  Continued deployment of Motorola radios will allow AETC to reuse these existing assets.  Motorola is the only recognized source for system components and internal proprietary options to their radios.

Brand Name Justification

Justification for Enterasys switches and routers for use on DDHU Local Area Network (LAN):  DDC has installed local area networks, LANs, throughout its Distribution Depots across the globe supporting the DLA logistical mission to support the War Fighter.  Each depot has its own network installed per IEEE 802.3, EIA/TIA, and DLA standards and policies comprised of a sole manufacturer network hardware configuration.

This sole manufacturer network hardware configuration has enhanced our management capabilities of DDC funds by reducing the number of maintenance support contracts, decreasing the multiple vendor training requirements for site IT personnel, and eliminating the need for various ancillary IT equipment or software installations required to allow functionality between multi vendor equipment.  Enterasys network switching equipment is the hardware installed at sixteen Distribution Depots located in CONUS. This standardization was planned in part due to the network infrastructure configuration at the time of the DDC stand up.

The configuration of our network using equipment from a sole manufacturer strengthens network management abilities allowing the identification of specific data software tools used for local area/wide area network management oversight.  In order to increase network security according to the DLA Telecommunications Infrastructure Plan, Objective 3.1, DDC will centrally manage and operate to the port and device level all its data communications network assets.  The tool in use is Netsight Management Suite; this software is compatible only with Enterasys network hardware.  This increases our effectiveness to maintain DDC networks that are functional, dependable and available in support of our mission.

DELIVERABLES AND PERFORMANCE
The period of performance of the contract is from date of award through November 8, 2008.  The Orientation and Kickoff Meeting is to occur 5 days after contract award.   The Final Report is due on November 1, 2008.  All other target dates for the remaining tasks shall be coordinated between the parties.  The Government STB subject matter experts will determine the technical acceptance of deliverables and determine whether major or minor revisions to the deliverables are required.  Consistent with the requirement for this independent study, the STB will not request revisions to the substance of the report's conclusions or recommendations.  Major revisions are considered to require significant content changes and shall be requested by the Contracting Officer, in writing and via electronic mail.  All reports shall require no more than one major revision.  The COTR may orally request minor revisions that are considered essentially editorial.  

REVIEW PERIOD FOR DELIVERABLES
The Government will have ten (10) working days to complete the review of deliverables, unless otherwise specified by the Government.  If deficiencies are found, the contractor shall have five (5) working days to correct the deficiencies and submit the corrections to the Government.

The following payment schedule and invoicing procedures are contemplated and may be further negotiated prior to contract award:
1.  CLINS 0001 through 0003 for Tasks 1, 2, and 3 must be completed and invoiced sequentially.  
2.  Upon completion of CLIN 0001 for Task 1, the Contractor shall submit an invoice for approval/rejection before starting CLIN 0002 for Task 2.

4.  CLINS 0004 through 0008 for Tasks 4, 5a, 5b, 5c, and 6 may be performed simultaneously and may begin before the completion of CLIN 0003 for Task 3.   The Contractor is expected to invoice monthly along with the submission of monthly reports.  The Government shall review the reports and process the invoices in accordance with acceptance of the reports.  Subject to the delivery of the Final Report, an approved invoice will result in a 75% payment to the Contractor with 25% of the payment withheld.  Upon submission of the Final Report, the retained 25% will be disbursed along with the final payment.  Final payment shall be in accordance with the completion of Line Item Number 0008, Task 6 which shall result in an accepted final report.  All funds held in escrow shall be disbursed in accordance with the acceptance of the final report.
  
Upon certification by the Contractor and as confirmed by the COTR that 33% completion of CLINS 0004 through 0008 for Tasks 4, 5a, 5b, 5c, and 6  has been achieved, the Contractor may invoice for a percentage of the fixed priced CLIN amounts as determine prior to contract award.

CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION
Work under this contract requires that the Contractor be given access to confidential or proprietary business, technical, or financial information belonging to other private parties or the Government. Consistent with our statutory obligations under 49 USC 11904, the Contractor, upon gaining access to such information, will treat this information as confidential and agrees not to appropriate such information to its own use or to disclose such information to third parties unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer in writing. The foregoing obligations shall not apply to:  1) Information that, at the time of receipt by the Contractor, is in the public domain; 2) Information that, through no fault of the Contractor, becomes part of the public domain after the Contractor has received it; 3) Information that the Contractor can demonstrate was already in its possession and was, therefore, not acquired directly or indirectly from the Government; or 4) Information that that Contractor can demonstrate was received from a third party who did not require the Contractor to hold it in confidence.  The Contractor shall obtain from each of its employees a written agreement not to discuss, divulge, or disclose any confidential information or data to any person or entity except those persons within the Contractors organization who themselves have signed a similar written agreement and are directly involved in the performance of the contract. In addition, the Contractor must secure from the Contracting Officer approval of these confidentiality agreements.

Occasionally, and upon request from the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall supply the Government with reports itemizing information received as confidential or proprietary and setting forth the organization or organizations from which the Contractor received such information.
DUPLICATION AND DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL DATA
Duplication or disclosure of the data and other information provided by the Surface Transportation Board (STB) or to which the contractor will have access as a result of this contract is prohibited.  The contractor hereby agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all such data to which access may be gained throughout contract performance whether title thereto vests in the STB or otherwise.  The contractor hereby agrees not to disclose said data, any interpretations thereof, or data derivative there from, to unauthorized parties in contravention of these provisions without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer or the party in which title thereto is wholly vested.

This amendment clarifies that this is a FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  It is NOT restricted to GSA Schedule holders.  

This posting on FBO takes precedence over the document posted on STB website. 

The preferred method for submitting proposals is via e-mail.  Proposals shall be transmitted no later than 9:00 a.m., September 4, 2007.   All offerors are cautioned to allow time to exercise alternative methods for submitting proposals to meet the September 4, 2007, 9:00 a.m. submission time.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for transmission problems and errors.   ALL OTHER PROPOSAL submissions shall be delivered to and be in the possession of the Contracting Officer at 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE, Washington, DC 20590 no later than September 4, 2007 at 9:00 a.m. and shall consist of FIVE (5) hard copies of the total proposal package that include the cost and technical proposals.

QUESTION:  While reviewing the complete request for proposal posted at http://www.stb.dot.gov, I noticed that GSA number is requested as part of the Cost Proposal.  Our firm does not have a GSA number.  Will this result in our proposal being labeled as "non-responsive"?    RESPONSE:  This is a FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  No GSA Schedule Number is required.

QUESTION:  There is a reference to a due date of August 7 with the solicitation documentation.  Please confirm that the due date is September 4, 2007.  RESPONSE:  Proposals are due on September 4, 2007 at 9:00 a.m. CONTRACTING OFFICER e-mail address is Clementine.caudle-wr@dot.gov

<DESC>This amendment number two provides QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES

Proposals are due no later than 9:00 a.m. on September 4, 2007

0 - QUESTON:  What is the Contracting Officer?s e-mail address?  RESPONSE:  CLEMENTINE.CAUDLE-WR@DOT.GOV

1 - QUESTION:  Can you provide an indication as to its expected budget, budget range, total level of effort (hours) or estimated level of effort by Task?  RESPONSE:  THE GOVERNMENT HAS A $1.2 MILLION BUDGET FOR THIS STUDY.    

2 - QUESTION:  Are there any explicit instructions regarding the detail required and the formatting of the Cost Proposal?  RESPONSE:   WHEREAS THE CONTRACTOR IS EXPECTED TO PROPOSE ITS COST IN ACCORDANCE WITH STANDARD COMMERCIAL PRACTICE AND INDUSTRY STANDARD, THE COST PROPOSAL SHOULD FURTHER DEFINE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROPOSED SKILL MIX THAT THE CONTRACTOR CONSIDERS NECESSARY TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE PROJECT.   THE PROPOSED COSTS SHOULD BE FURTHER ALLOCATED AMONG THE VARIOUS TASKS AND FULLY DETAILED AS TO WHY THE ALLOCATION WOULD BEST ADDRESS THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUIREMENTS.  THE SPECIFIC COSTS PER TASK AS DERIVED FROM THE PROPOSED NUMBER OF HOURS AND HOURLY RATES ARE TO BE USED TO MEASURE THE EFFORT THE CONTRACTOR PROPOSES TO ALLOCATE TO EACH TASK.  

3 - QUESTION:  The press is reporting that the STB wants its prospective contractor to have ?no ties to the railroad industry.?  That is not the same standard described at 4.1.6 wherein ?the PM nor the Key Personnel will be subject to a conflicts screening ? must demonstrate that do not have an interest that would bias the results of the study.? Which is it?   RESPONSE:  THE STANDARD DESCRIBED AT 4.1.6 IS REQUIRED AS THE GOVERNMENT CERTAINLY WANT PEOPLE WITH RELEVANT EXPERIENCE IN THE RAILROAD INDUSTRY.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO INSURE THAT THE SUBMITTED REPORT IS NOT TAINTED BY A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.  AT MINIMUM, A FIRM CAN SHOW THAT IT HAS RELEVANT EXPERIENCE, AND THAT IT DOES NOT DEPEND INORDINATELY ON FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM ONE STAKEHOLDER INTEREST. 

4 - QUESTION:  Is there any way that the deadline can be extended even three business days to increase the chances that your client receives at least one, responsive proposal?  RESPONSE:  YES.  THE PROPOSAL DUE DATE IS MODIFIED TO SEPTEMBER 4, 2007.
 
5 - QUESTION:  A 25 percent hold back is by far the most exorbitant.  Will the Government consider reducing that amount to a more conventional 10 percent?   RESPONSE:  AFTER FURTHER RESEARCH, THE GOVERNMENT AGREES TO REDUCE THE HOLD BACK TO TEN PERCENT.   
  
6 - QUESTION:  Other than the ?Combine Synopsis/Solicitation? and the ?Amendment to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation? post on August 13, 2007 on the Federal Business Opportunities web site, is there any other version of this request for proposal?  RESPONSE:  YES.  THE LINK IS AT HTTP://WWW.STB.DOT.GOV, SEE "ITEMS OF INTEREST" AND WILL BE AVAILABLE AUGUST 24, 2007.

7 - QUESTION:  In the six page document on page 2 of 6 it states:  ?The Contractor shall offer pricing for each of the following Contract Line Item Numbers (CLIN) and corresponding Tasks:?   Should this response be included as part of the technical proposal or submitted as a separate cost proposal?  RESPONSE:  THE CLIN AND CORRESPONDING TASKS SHALL BE INCLUDED SOLELY WITH THE COST PROPOSAL.

8 - QUESTION:  The CLIN task list on page 2 of 6 of the six page document does not match up exactly with the task list in Section 4 on pp. 4-5 of 10 of the ten page document. Should the CLIN task list be adapted to match the task list in the Technical Proposal?  RESPONSE:  YES.  THE CLIN TASK LIST SHOULD MATCH THE TASK LIST OF THE TECHNICAL PROPOSAL.  End of Amendment number 2.

IV.  PROVISIONS/CLAUSES:  DEADLINE: Offers are due on 25 September 2007 by 2:00 PM EST. Submit offers or any questions to the attention of Tina M. Lopez, 6CONS/LGCM, via fax 813-828-7160, or preferably by email to tina.lopez-02@macdill.af.mil

V.  The following questions have been asked by Interested Offerors and the following Government response has been provided.

Question 1:  If the jurisdictional [environmental] agencies request a higher level of site specific information, and MacDill AFB agrees to the requirements, will additional costs associated to Site specific surveys or request for additional information may include, but is not limited to, seagrass surveys, engineering design or certification, benthic surveys, bathymetric surveys, hydrodynamic investigations or navigational surveys and navigational requirements be allowed?

RESPONSE TO QUESTION 1: Future permit applications will be prepared to the same level of detail as past applications.  The Government does not anticipate the regulatory agencies will require additional surveys for future work but if required additional work/surveys/data as part of the permit application beyond what has been accomplished previously with MacDill Project Manager's verification of the increased requirements, then a reevaluation of the permit costs may be considered. 

Question 2:  How will additional monitoring required by the jurisdictional agencies be addressed in this project?  

Response to Question 2:  Monitoring will be accomplished consistent with the requirements outlined in scope of work.  If any additional monitoring by the jurisdictional agencies is encountered, then reevaluation of the monitoring costs may be considered. 

Question 3: Phase 7 and 8 - all Lo Pro domes or shell bag bars are estimated to be within 100' of mean high water (MHW) for construction purposes.  Any construction beyond 100' MHW may require construction barge techniques to prevent damage to existing seagrass beds in the area. 

Response to Question 3:  Phase 7 & 8 work for the installation of the oyster domes is to be accomplished to avoid impacts to seagrass that may exist at this site.  Installation of the shell bags would be accomplished from a land-based postion as with previous projects and the oyster domes may be accomplished in the method best determined by the offeror.

Question 4:   Will any increase in concrete costs used to manufacture the Reef Balls or high transportation costs above a fixed percentage be included in the contract for a economic price adjustment?  due to 25% in any two year period will require adjustments to material costs.

Response to Question 4:  The estimated cost of materials is porportionally high (roughly 65-75% of the cost of the project).  The Government may consider including economic price adjustments for designated materials.  Offerors are encouraged to identify the commodity item and applicable percentage range for adjustment in thier responsive offeror.  The Government reserves the right to consider inclusion of additional contract terms and conditions.  However, Offerors need to be aware if such an economic price adjustment is incorporated into the contract, then both parties will mutually agree to a designated reference index to be used for any escalation adjustment both upwardly and downwardly within the established range.

<DESC>This amendment is to post the Brand Name Justification and Approval for Brand Name.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL

BRAND Name
Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.3)

1. Contracting Agency and Activity. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency,
Acquisition Contracts plans to contract by other than full and open competition.  This document sets forth the justification and approval for use of one of the exceptions to full. and open competition allowed under the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984.

2. Nature of Action Being Approved. This procurement is to an existing hardware storage.
EDM has been tasked to provide digital data on all NGA Networks. The addition of this storage is critical in providing the storage necessary for customer access to Computer to Plate
data as part of routine Operations and Maintenance equipment refreshments.

3. Description of Supplies or Services.  The purchase of a One Hundred and Sixty Eight Terrabyte NetApp 3050 Storage device for integration and storage.

4. Statutory Authority. "The proposed action may be awarded without full and open competition under 10 U.S.C. 253(c)(l) as implemented in FAR 6.302-1."

5. Rationale Supporting Use of Citation in NO.4. The purchase of a NetApp 3050 Filer is critical to provide the storage necessary to make digital information available to all of our authenticated internal and external customers on an unclassified level.

When selecting the additional storage that would be compatible with existing operating systems three key requirements were established. The first was platform dependence, interoperability and maintenance support; the second was scalability; and the third was cost. There are three storage solutions available to NGA. They are HP, SUN and NetApps.  Network Appliances storage option is the best fit in all three categories.  NetApps ?Snap Mirror? technology allows quick seamless data copying between NetApp storage devices.  Only NetApp has the Snap Mirror capability.  The Network Appliances system supports multiple operating systems within logical volumes which provides excellent flexibility should the need arise to migrate one or all of our existing systems from Unix to a Windows operating system without incurring additional storage costs.  The HP and SUN products cannot perform this task as it relates to interoperability with our current system.  Network Appliance equipment is the only equipment which meets NGA requirements of reliability, maintenance, performance (to include compatibility and compliance), and scalability critical to NGA?s operations.

6. Other Information. For continuity of integration, cost and services, it is in the best interest of NGA to purchase NetApp equipment. Costs incurred in conducting compatibility and integration testing with other storage solutions at this time would be cost prohibitive and can not fulfill current mission needs.

7. The Efforts to Identify Additional Sources Including the Market Research Conducted.
Once the NetApps technology was selected as the optimal choice, additional market research was conducted to determine if competitive opportunities existed. Market research was conducted by
both the Program Management Office and Acquisition Contracting to locate other NetApp channel partners (resellers) who may provide this IT equipment. The PMO identified IMMIX as one channel partner and ACI has identified GTSI, FCN, DLT Solutions, Commercial Data Systems Technology, Raytheon, and Network Appliance as competitive sources for this brand name competitive action.

8. Future Plans to Permit Competition. This purchase will provide the critical storage space needed to store and share CTP data. Future requirements for storage purchases will
be procured using the above market research strategy or through brand name competitive actions.

9. Recommendation and Certification from Program Office
Based on the above, I recommend this acquisition be conducted on the basis of other than full
and open competition. I certify that technical data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel which form the basis for this justification are complete and accurate.

Brand Name Justification

Justification for Enterasys switches and routers for use on DDHU Local Area Network (LAN):  DDC has installed local area networks, LANs, throughout its Distribution Depots across the globe supporting the DLA logistical mission to support the War Fighter.  Each depot has its own network installed per IEEE 802.3, EIA/TIA, and DLA standards and policies comprised of a sole manufacturer network hardware configuration.

This sole manufacturer network hardware configuration has enhanced our management capabilities of DDC funds by reducing the number of maintenance support contracts, decreasing the multiple vendor training requirements for site IT personnel, and eliminating the need for various ancillary IT equipment or software installations required to allow functionality between multi vendor equipment.  Enterasys network switching equipment is the hardware installed at sixteen Distribution Depots located in CONUS. This standardization was planned in part due to the network infrastructure configuration at the time of the DDC stand up.

The configuration of our network using equipment from a sole manufacturer strengthens network management abilities allowing the identification of specific data software tools used for local area/wide area network management oversight.  In order to increase network security according to the DLA Telecommunications Infrastructure Plan, Objective 3.1, DDC will centrally manage and operate to the port and device level all its data communications network assets.  The tool in use is Netsight Management Suite; this software is compatible only with Enterasys network hardware.  This increases our effectiveness to maintain DDC networks that are functional, dependable and available in support of our mission.

<CONTACT>James Brown, Contract Specialist, Phone 404-338-9219, Fax 404-338-9231, Email james.brown@irs.gov
<DESC>AMENDMENT 0002 - This amendment answers questions submitted regarding this RFQ. The due date for quotes is unchanged.

Question 1 - Will contractors bidding this job be required to furnish performance bond and/or Tennessee Contractor's License?

Answer - Please refer to paragraph in RFQ entitled PERMITS, LICENSES AND CERTIFICATES.  It addresses Contractor's responsibilities for licenses.  Performance bonds are not required.  

Question 2 - The issue of fill material was brought up by more than one party at the site visit, and whether it should be Marley fill or an alternate brand would suffice.  Marley specs call for the fill to be supported by tubing attached to the structural frame work and not supported from the basin like many aftermarket suppliers.  The spec/scope says "install new fill, louvers, and drift eliminators per Marley specifications", and also states mil thicknesses for fill and DE's.  Does "install" mean that Marley fill must be used? It seems that it could be clarified for all bidders if a phrase such as "install new fill, louvers, and drift eliminators per Marley specifications using Marley OEM materials" were added.  That would clarify what is allowable/acceptable

Answer - Suggested language is added.  Revised sentence should read as follows: Install new fill, louvers, and drift eliminators per Marley specifications using Marley OEM materials.
  
Question 3 - What is the required completion date?  

Answer - The RFQ requires that you provide an anticipated completion date. It states hat the technical proposal should include the Offerors plan of accomplishment, start-up time required, resources to be allotted to the project, and anticipated completion.  

While we have not stated a specific time to complete this order, we do expect that once actual work on site starts, the contractor will continue working until the project is complete.
 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
