Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3805, the Management and Operating Contractor for the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).&nbsp;&nbsp;BEA is seeking parties interested in potentially entering into a license agreement for the purpose of commercializing the technology described below.&nbsp;&nbsp;BEA does not make any representations, provide any warranties, or otherwise endorse or guarantee the suitability of this intellectual property to a licensee's specific needs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; color: #222222; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">INVENTION SUMMARY:<br /></span></strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 9pt;">Many materials such as biomass are notoriously difficult to reliably feed. Auger systems tend to form "rat holes" where biomass material is removed in the vicinity of the auger, but bridges above it, preventing feeding. Bin systems tend to bridge at the outlet of the bin, preventing m from feeding out of the bottom of the bin.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"> <br /> This INL developed material handling technology includes a conical bin combined with an auger to ensure constant output from the conical bin into the subsequent process. The feeder design is currently used on a biomass analytical sample grinding unit. This enables automated grinding of biomass analytical samples. This feeder could be scaled up to feed larger biomass processing operations, including cellulosic ethanol production, pellet production, etc. This feeder could also be used in multiple other applications where controlled, continuous feed of material is necessary for downstream processing. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"><br /> </span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background: yellow;"><br /> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">This invention has associated intellectual property filing Patent Application No.&nbsp;&nbsp;62/339,568, "Feeder For Biomass Materials" which was submitted to the USPTO by BEA on May 20, 2016 and currently unpublished.</span></p>

Additional development will be required to demonstrate a pilot scale process. BEA may be in a position to support additional research and development of this technology under a mutually acceptable Cooperative Research &amp; Development Agreement (CRADA), Strategic Partnership Projects (SPP), or similar agreement subject to prior approval by DOE.<strong><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"><br /> </span><br /> SELECTION PROCESS:<br /></strong></span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 9pt;">BEA seeks to license this intellectual property to the best qualified candidate to ensure its successful commercialization. If multiple parties are interested in licensing this&nbsp;intellectual property, BEA may select an exclusive licensing arrangement with a single candidate or choose alternative licensing strategies (e.g., non-exclusive or exclusive field of use licenses) to increase the probability of successful commercialization. BEA reserves the right to defer any licensing decision if, in BEA's sole opinion, the submitted business plans are unacceptable to BEA. BEA may consider inquiries made prior to the release of this notice and inquiries made through other channels. Although interested parties are encouraged to respond before the date provided to ensure consideration, all inquiries may be considered prior to a formal selection unless this notice specifically states otherwise.&nbsp;</span></p>

The useful life of photovoltaic devices can be significantly degraded by moisture. It is estimated that 2% of photovoltaic modules fail within 8 years of operation and that 16% of these failures are related to encapsulant degradation. Due to the long lifetime of modules (approximately 30 years) this problem is difficult to avoid even by using low water diffusivity materials.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">There are destructive and non</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&#8208;</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">destructive ways to measure water content in a photovoltaic device but each has its limitations. Destructive measures are one time measurements in a given device and non</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&#8208;</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">destructive techniques require moisture indicator compounds in a device that alters the devices actual configuration thereby creating an unknown element in the measurement. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">LLNL's Hydroscanner research team's technology focuses on measuring water ingress in photovoltaic modules.

In this way a quantitative 2D image of the water content in a given device can be obtained remotely and repeatedly over time. A key challenge is presented by adapting the technique to modules with complex structure made of multiple layers with various material properties, composition and roughness.</span></p>

<p>Successful implementation of LLNLs technique can lead to a field-deployed rapid screening tool that can measure moisture ingress in hundreds of modules per day under a variety of weathering conditions, identifying items that are more prone to damage and thus allowing for mitigation measures before failure occurs.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Transport Specimen Bags. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MS-1508-53_Transport_Specimen_Bags are eligible for participation. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Transport Specimen Bags  products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MS-1508-53_Transport_Specimen_Bags. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL MS-1508-53_Transport_Specimen_Bags must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of three (3) years (36 months) from date of selection, with one (1) 24-month "option" period not to exceed a total of 5 years. Anticipated selection date is 20 December 2016. Among vendors who are on the subject QSL, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Transport Specimen Bags.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Transport Specimen Bags. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $664,059 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on the QSL MS-1508-53_Transport_Specimen_Bags who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Pacific that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO Pacific via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Daylight Savings Time (CDT) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units.

Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, such as Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices, incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted.  A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices such as FSS prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Points of Contact (POCs): </span><br />Mr. Joe Winter, MMESO South Clinical Analyst, joseph.n.winter.ctr@mail.mil, 210-536-6072, or Mr. David Sheaffer, MMESO South Team Leader, david.v.sheaffer.ctr@mail.mil, 210-536-6075.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Transport Specimen Bags. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong><br />These Transport Specimen Bags products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. <br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Transport Specimen Bags in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant County End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.&nbsp; <br /><br />The QSL for Transport Specimen Bags will be established approximately August 2016 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately September 2016 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Transport Specimen Bags. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Transport Specimen Bags. <br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Transport Specimen Bags. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $664,059. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Two items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 75.45% ($501,032) of the total volume in sales ($664,059). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.&nbsp;<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Daylight Time (CDT) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.</strong>&nbsp; <br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.&nbsp; <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.
