<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Charles A. McClellan, Contract Specialist, (202) 273-8763, Contracting Officer - Chris Burroughs, Contracting Officer, (202) 273-4812
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation (RFP 101-05-03) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The announcement constitutes the only solicitation; responses reflecting availability of the service as described are requested in the form of a proposal. A separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-09. The NAICS Classification code is 519120. The value range of this requirement is 100,000 _ 175,000 dollars. The department of Veterans Affairs requires assistance to (1) maintain the BVA Research Center catalog with citator (VADEX/CITATOR), which is the primary index to the contents of the Research Center at the Board; (2) conduct attachment verification of dispatched Board decisions electronically attached to the Veterans Appeals Control and Locator System (VACOLS); and (3) provide other consultation and programming support as required. The VADEX is the primary index to the contents of the Research Center at the Board. It is analogous to a card catalogue in a library. The CITATOR is an index to the historical texts of VA regulations in chronological order, which are currently maintained on microfiche. The VADEX/CITATOR must be updated quarterly, and be available in an on-line format comparable to the presently used FOLIO InfoBase. Support services will include scheduled periodic pickup of material for processing and periodic delivery to the Board of processed input documents, error listings, and VADEX/CITATOR proof lists; vocabulary modification, control and maintenance; and secure archival storage of magnetic tape and film masters. Skills required for these services include expertise in the following: UNIX operating system software; Microsoft NT computer server operating system software; Microsoft Windows 3.1 and 95 PC software; Oracle SQLnet and Version 7 Oracle Database software; Powerbuilder software and C++ programming language; Folio retrieval software; Microsoft Word, Access and Excel applications software. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: This system utilizes a thesaurus that is arranged alphabetically and contains roughly 3000 subject headings and about 705 cross-references. All documents received by the Research Center that are of interest to the Board_s professional staff are indexed. BVA personnel decide what items will be indexed. The contractor should provide personnel capable of indexing this material from its beginning to its current form. The current system permits the retrieval of the text of a regulation as it existed on its first effective date through each change of text to the present form. The package of information provided to the contractor to enter into the Citator system includes a CITATOR Development Form, a hand-drawn time-line diagram, the text of the regulation for each time period, available transmittal sheets, and a CITATOR Update Form (for changes only). The VADEX/CITATOR is cumulative and published quarterly. At six-week intervals between publishing, advance sheets must be provided showing the material indexed in the intervening period. In the past, as many as 500 incoming documents have been indexed yearly. At present, the number is closer to 300 yearly. A single change of a VA regulation may be both indexed in VADEX and updated in the CITATOR, including new pages containing regulatory text, transmittal sheets, and a new graphic representation to be filmed and added to the existing reference packet. When the most commonly used VA regulations have been entered into the CITATOR, the estimated number of changes (updates) per year is 150. VADEX Code Sheets, source documents, and CITATOR packages will be picked up weekly by the contractor. VADEX proof lists and any processed CITATOR and tree proof lists may be returned to the Board by the contractor for review and proofing prior to final inclusion in the CITATOR or microfilming of the regulation trees and text versions. It is anticipated that approximately 27,000 to 34,000 decisions will be dispatched by BVA in a year. The approximate breakdown would be between 519 and 654 attachments to be verified per week. In the past, verifications have been accomplished at a rate of between 50 and 60 decisions per hour. Weekly pick-ups from the BVA Research Center will be arranged by the contractor, with a one-week turnaround time expected. A weekly discrepancy report, deliverable to the Director of the Research Center, must list and fully describe the problems discovered with respect to individual VACOLS records, and an electronic copy of the correct Board decision in the appropriate format must be provided by the contractor. (The Board will be responsible for actually correcting the individual VACOLS records and decision attachments.) Errata included in this report must be identified by the veteran_s name, appellant_s name (if different from veteran_s name), VA file number, folder number in VACOLS, and the decision date stamped on the first page of the decision. Additional information is available and will be provided via e-mail upon request.

<CONTACT>Cynthia Spencer, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109653369, Fax 4109659560, Email cynthia.spencer@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Allen Systems Group (ASG) maintenance contract, 600-99-36572, for PreAlert and Fast Access Software expires on February 28, 2003.  The Social Security Administration (SSA) also has a maintenance agreement with ASG for Journal Manager Software.  The maintenance agreement for this product expires on May 16, 2003.  SSA has non-tiered site licenses for Fast Access, PreAlert and Journal Manager software. The salient characteristics of these software products are as follows: a) Fast Access is used to reduce processing times for Computer Associates-Integrated Database Management System database read, load and update jobs.  It accelerates the completion of batch jobs to obtain shorter processing times and it increases throughput.  Fast Access is activated through job control language so that no changes to applications programs or data base schema are required.  Fast Access accelerates local mode jobs, especially database loads and IDMS utilities; transfers data from disk to memory in amounts that optimizes each job; and monitors job performance and automatically adjusts numbers of buffers for optimum performance; b) PreAlert is a real-time control system that monitors Integrated Database Management System (IDMS) activity.  It provides multiple threshold definitions so that unique action can be triggered automatically when exceptions occur.  It is used to pre-define problem thresholds e.g. waiting time, and to notify the technicians when this threshold is exceeded.  It alerts the technical staff when a critical function of the IDMS becomes degraded.  It isolates the problem and then generates a warning message. PreAlert monitors IDMS from outside of the central versions to detect and resolve problems; allows multiple threshold definitions so that a unique level of action can automatically be triggered; monitors Multiple Virtual Storage (MVS) across multiple MVS address spaces; permits MVS and CA-IDMS events to occur across multiple central versions and be monitored from a single terminal, and accommodates multiple threshold definitions so that an exception condition can automatically trigger a unique action; c)Journal Manager is a comprehensive journal management tool that is designed specifically to work with Computer Associates (CA) IDMS mainframe software.  It provides on line access to CA IDMS documents.  Journal Manager is used for replication and recovery procedures.  Journal Manager provides the technical staff with the ability to automatically off load, control, and store all of the CA IDMS journal archive-based activities from multiple-sources in the MVS environment.  Journal Manager captures information for journal archive data sets; automates journal offload; controls and automates the use of files for replications and recoveries of database updates; and provides an online archive management facility.  These products are installed on all four of the central processing units that include one (1) IBM Z90020641C6 and three (3) IBM Z90020641C9 machines and are located at the SSA's National Computer Center in Woodlawn Maryland.  A new maintenance contract with a systems life of 5-years is required for all three of these products.   The effective date for the new contract is March 1, 2003. Allen Systems Group is the only known source capable of providing the required maintenance service for these proprietary software products.  Other firms capable of providing the required maintenance service are invited to submit complete details, these details should include complete information regarding: 1) warranty and maintenance; 2) any software license agreement(s); and 3) Section 508 compliance, visit website www.ssa.gov/oag/acq and choose Section 508 Information.  The responses must clearly state the ability to provide the necessary maintenance services required for the above stated software products by November 4, 2002.  If no viable responses have been received in response to this announcement, SSA shall initiate negotiations solely with Allen Systems Group.  The Government does not intend to pay for information received.  Faxed responses will not be accepted.  The size limitation for email attachments is 5 megabytes per individual email message.  The SSA utilizes Microsoft Work 97 as the standard word processing software. When responding to this announcement refer to SSA-03-Allen Systems.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Instrument Modifications to the 2D-Star and Estar instruments and engineering support associated with flights planned with these instruments.  Task to be accomplished include:  1) Hardware modifications to (a) reconfigure the arinc interface and data system so that the 2D-Star and Estar instruments can operate separately with a single rack of equipment; (b) reconfigure the digital correlators so that Estar records all four "IQ" products and 2D-Star instrument records an appropriate pair (II and IQ); and (c) repair existing problems with the fourth correlator card in the 2D-Star instrument.  Documentation shall include finalize preliminary documentation for the 2D-Star and Estar instruments reflecting changes made above, and include appropriate system diagrams, parts list, photographs and documentation of software.  Engineering support:  provide engineering support and an operator for flight experiments on the NASA P-3 aircraft including:  (a) test flights at the Wallops Flight Facility; (b) a possible deployment to Alaska in March 2003; and (c) a major hydrology experiment in mid-2003.   This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Prosensing, Inc., Amherst, MA 01002.  The 2D-Star is a synthetic aperature microwave radiometer that uses signal processing rather than conventional techniques for creating an image.  This is new technology for radiometers and the 2D-Star instrument is the first airborne instrument to employ synthesis in two dimensions.  Prosensing built this instrument and participated in its flight tests.  Prosensing has a unique capability with this technology and were also involved in the development of the predecessor instrument, Estar, which demonstrated the technology.  They have recently rebuilt the Estar instrument replacing the correlators and replacing the data system and internal control electronics.  Since Prosensing built both instruments to be modified and supported and has operated both of them in the field during recent hydrology experiments, they are uniquely qualified to perform this work. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 31, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Qualified prospective offerors will access the solicitation via electronic means only from the SPAWARSYSCOM Virtual Program Office (VPO) web site entitled ?PMW-159 TDLP Phase 2? (URL is https://vpo.spawar.navy.mil). Any amendments, when issued, will also be available only on this web site.

OFFERORS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AND INCLUDE A COPY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS WITH THEIR PROPOSALS: FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications - Commercial Items.  Access the FAR and DFAR at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/	 The government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering price and price-related factors. 52.212-2  EVALUATION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS--OCT 1995 (a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.   (I)    TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE  REQUIREMENT ( ii)   PAST PERFORMANCE (iii)  PRICE Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below. Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii) is approximately equal  to Factor (iii), PRICE.   At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offer ors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.    (b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award.  (c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE informati on submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS , Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous pr oposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quali ty product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. (d)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (e)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of  withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This procurement is for the construction of two (2) waterfront fuel handling facilities that will transfer fuel to and from fuel tankers berthed at Delta and Echo Piers respectively, to and from COMNAVMAR storage tanks located at Sasa Valley and Tenjo Valley, Guam, Mariana Islands. More specifically, the subject project will provide three (3) 8-inch diameter mechanical fuel loading arms at Delta Pier and another three (3) 8-inch mechanical fuel loading arms at Echo Pier.  The work will include providing structural support to the loading arms, pier modifications, and piping connections to existing fuel manifold systems at each pier.  The work will also include providing a micronic filter vessel, rated at 150 psig in the JP-5 fuel handling system replacing existing sump pumps, one at each pier. Because the facilities to be provided are waterfront fuel handling facilities, qualified contractors must have prior experience with installation of fuel related equipment/systems/piping in highly corrosive salt water environments.  Also, since all welds provided under the subject project will be subjected to non-destructive testing and evaluation, qualified contractors must have this type of specialized experience.  
This project has been set aside as a 8(a) competitive procurement, restricted to 8(A) firms certified for participation in the 8(a) Program, who are serviced by the SBA in Regions IX and X, and who submit evidence of bonding in the amount of the price proposal. 
Source selection is considered the appropriate method for procuring this project because it provides the Government with the ability to obtain a qualified contractor based on technical merit and price competition.  
The Government intends to award this contract without discussions and will incorporate FAR 52.215-1, into the solicitation.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) drafted a plan to address current deficiencies and problems focused on special deposit accounts (SDA's), which are  temporary deposits of trust funds that OST can not immediately credit to rightful account holders. The recently completed SDA Clean-up Pilot Project, Phases 1 and 2, included development of work plan procedures, a SQL database tracking system, and recommended procedures and processes to prevent recurrences of similar situations. The purpose of these efforts is to use the methodology to address deficiencies which the Office of the Inspector General identified in third party independent audit findings that refer or relate to SDA's and to comply with the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994. Also, on July 10, 2001, Secretarial Order 3231 established the Office of Historical Trust Accounting (OHTA), which charged the office with developing and implementing a comprehensive plan for providing individual Indian and tribal beneficiaries with an accounting of their funds. Various offices, including the General Accounting Office, the Federal District Court, and the Court Monitor, who urge progress in the historical accounting project, oversee OHTA. OST will distribute some funds in the SDA's to individual or tribal account holders. Phase 3 of this project will implement the SDA's project work plan procedures at the national level to cover SDA's for all Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) regions. Phase 3 will implement policies, procedures, and processes to prevent recurrences of problems associated with SDA's. The OST, BIA and the successful contractor will coordinate and conduct field visits; gather, collect, and analyze trust data and documents, both paper and electronic; recommend courses of action based on analysis; train; and identify issues and recommend solutions involving SDA's. Some SDA's will require additional analysis beyond the SDA's work plan procedures. In such circumstances, the successful contractor will provide written analysis via position papers to support their conclusions and recommendations for options and alternatives for the Office of Trust Funds Management (OTFM), a subdivision of OST, and BIA management consideration. The scope of this contract will cover all trust reform initiatives for which OST/OTFM may involve supplemental work for any other projects. This may include daily operational enhancements, accounting services, consultant services, research and reconciliation activities, and systems applications including development, maintenance and management. Proposed period of performance: One base period plus four option years. The agency shall consider a proposal from all responsible sources. See Numbered Note 26. The contracting office will accept requests for solicitations through facsimile machine 505.816.1288, attn: Keith Kennedy.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the extension of the Transition Region & Coronal Explorer (TRACE) Satellite Mission Operations & Data Analysis contract on a sole source basis and in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, to Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company for a two-year extension to contract NAS5-38099.  This extension will provide continued monitoring of the health and performance of the one-instrument TRACE satellite.	The TRACE science investigation quantitatively explores the connection between fine-scale magnetic fields and the associated plasma structures of the sun.  The TRACE instrument collects sequences of digital images that show all regions of the atmosphere simultaneously using high resolution extreme ultraviolet radiation.  In December 1993, Lockheed Martin was competitively selected to define, design, fabricate, test, calibrate, and integrate the spacecraft, monitor and control orbital operations, and publish data from the TRACE instrument.  TRACE was launched in April 1998 and scheduled to allow joint observations with the Solar & Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite during the rising phase of the solar cycle to sunspot maximums.  In order to maintain uninterrupted mission operations and quick response to critical events and to avoid the loss of unique and vital research data, it is essential that Lockheed Martin continue to deliver the specialized support it has provided over the last nine years for TRACE and all related scientific investigative activities.  Therefore, Lockheed Martin is considered the only responsible source capable of fulfilling this requirement.  All responsible sources desiring consideration are requested to fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days of the date of publication of this synopsis to the point-of-contact specified below. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26.  See note 22.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed, See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:	  http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

B. REQUIREMENTS: (1) TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: (a) Introduction: A key element of Transformational Communications (TC) is laser communication (lasercomm) support for a diverse set of Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (AISR) platforms (i.e., Global Hawk, U2, MC2A). Forecasted user needs project 10 vehicles in each of 2 theaters plus an additional 4 vehicles worldwide with data rates of up to 2.5 Gbps per vehicle. The system concept must take into account ISR platforms that will have highly asymmetric links as well as MC2A and Airborne Communications Networks (ACN) platforms, which will require two-way symmetrical link. The Multi-Access Laser Communication Head (MALCH) is a space-based optical system that can provide simultaneous laser communications with a number of airborne users. The MJPO currently believes that MALCH can achieve the desired capabilities at significantly reduced cost, weight, and power, and it is thus considered a critical enabling technology for the Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA). Traditional single axis laser communication systems that meet system requirements for communication to one asset can be used as a starting point for modification, or new concepts can be developed to allow for a multi-access system. Any plan should be developed with a goal of a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 6 by 2006. (b) PRDA Objectives: The purpose of this PRDA is to make up to three awards for research and development on a range of MALCH alternatives with an 11-month period of performance. The study should address the following high-level objectives: (i) Develop system requirements and design constraints. Initial requirements should use: the above number, types; and data rates of air assets; known spacecraft and space environments; connectivity with the Transformational Communication Architecture (TCA); and interoperability. Design constraints should address both terminal and space segments. Offerors should keep in mind the growing capabilities of the lasercomm link, MALCH for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) communications, and increased access links; (ii) Develop conceptual designs and assessments. Some alternative conceptual designs may include movable feed concepts, adaptive optics, optical phased arrays, etc. Provide recommendations and key performance metrics for critical technology development and prioritize these needs. Identify key technical performance measures (TPMs) for the system concept. Provide risk/benefit analysis of meeting TPMs. Create a plan to manage risk identified within the TPMs. Perform design trades using experimentation, simulation, and analysis to arrive at a recommended design; (iii) Identify relevant cost/benefit parameters with the goal of low-cost, reduced complexity theater terminal development; and (iv) Provide the technology development and prototyping efforts needed to reduce risks of selected technologies and design concepts to acceptable levels for inclusion in near-term program developments. This effort should include laboratory demonstrations of critical technologies traceable to system concepts. Include cost and schedule estimates, risk management approaches, and verification and validation test plans. Develop conceptual designs of prototype (e.g., breadboard/brassboard) hardware and test equipment. (2) DELIVERABLE ITEMS: The following items are required contract deliverables at the end of the 11-month period of performance: (i) Systems requirements allocation and design constraints; (ii) Architectural description and associated design characteristics of an end-state system capable of being modeled in the Aerospace Corp. Concept Design Center. This should include the key Technical Performance Measures; (iii) Draft performance specifications of the system concept; (iv) Initial technology concept traceable to system requirements; (v) Cost benefit parameter analysis description; (vi) Plan covering program risk reduction and risk management approaches; (vii) Integrated program master schedule; and (viii) monthly Technical meetings with the Government Transformational Communication Office (TCO).  The meetings may consist of, but are not limited to, teleconferencing and video teleconferencing. Final deliverables shall not contain proprietary information. (3) SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: (a) This acquisition may require access to classified material. Each PRDA contract will contain a Contract Security Classification Specification (DD Form 254). Work performed under this acquisition may be classified up to the DOD SECRET level. (b) Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms: Contracts will be awarded only to US companies. Foreign teaming, licensing, or subcontracting is not allowed. Proposals must be submitted with information no higher then SECRET classification. Proposals containing classified material must be delivered/transmitted via normal security procedures IAW NISPOM guidance to the address and point of contact indicated in Section A.

<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION: 
The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Space Vehicle Components Branch (VSSV), as part of the Space Vehicle Directorate (VS) at Kirtland AFB NM is interested in receiving proposals in lightweight mirror technology for space-deployable imaging telescopes.  The total program budget for these efforts is approximately $800K over 8 to 15 months. AFRL will make one award. This Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) will remain open 30 days after date of publication.  Open communication with the technical point of contact (POC) is encouraged until proposals are received. AFRL Evaluators may contact an offeror to clarify a point of information before completing the evaluation. 
The Government will provide a site visit on 10 April 2002.  Offerors should contact the Technical POC, Dr. R. Scott Erwin, (505) 846-9816, to make arrangements to participate in the site visit.
B. TECHNICAL TOPIC AREA: 
This technical effort is focused on the development of lightweight mirror systems technology for space-deployable imaging telescope applications. The contractor should consider innovative approaches for the design of stiff, lightweight, space-traceable mirrors that meet the performance requirements of visible imaging applications.   Development of prototype mirrors based on the proposed technology is desired.  AFRL is specifically interested in approaches that addresses the following goals (in order of importance):  ultra-lightweight, high-stiffness mirror structures (technology goals of < 15 kg/m2 areal density, which must factor in any required mechanisms and control electronics, and first natural frequency in test mounting configuration > 80 Hz), applicability to large apertures (technology goal of 0.6 meters diameter circular), ability to achieve desired radius of curvature in mirror structures (technology goal of 5 meters ?b .2% for spherical optics), ability to achieve stringent radius-of-curvature matching between segments (technology goal of < 40 microns differential ROC between 3 segments), ability to provide stringent mirror surface figure error (technology goal relative to a best fit reference sphere ?T ??/4 peak to valley and < ??/40 rms at 633 nm over central 95% clear aperture), visible-quality, space-qualifiable coatings (technology goal is reflectivity of R ?d 90% from 450 - 850 nm at normal incidence, with no visible pinholes or defects in surfaces when viewed without magnification over central 95% clear aperture, with durability performance equivalent or greater to that of standard aluminum coatings),  low surface roughness (technology goal ?T 20 angstroms rms over central 95% clear aperture), stringent mirror surface quality (technology goal better than 40-20 scratch ?V dig over central 95% clear aperture), low complexity approaches (i.e. non-actuated), low thermal gradient sensitivity mirror structures (i.e. low thermal expansion or high conductivity), and approaches that offer significant improvements in manufacturing time to current commercial mirror fabrication techniques.
Offerors must propose development, design, fabrication, and test three (3) prototype mirrors that address all of the above technology goals to be acceptable for award.  These mirrors must be compatible with a 3 point mechanical mounting interface, to be provided by AFRL, that will allow further test and evaluation by the Government.  Offerors should contact the Technical POC Dr. R. Scott Erwin, AFRL/VSSV, 505-846-9816, fax 505-846-7877, email: richard.erwin@kirtland.af.mil to obtain a description of the mounting interface and planned AFRL testing configuration.  
All measurement units presented to the Air Force should use the meter-kilogram-second (MKS) system.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS BEING SENT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL OFFERORS.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES TO THIS SOLICITATION.
This announcement is notification of the refreshing standing Solicitation Number FCGS-X6-98-0273-N covering Federal Supply Schedule 66, Part II, Section Q ? Geophysical, Environmental Analysis Equipment And Services: Class 6655 ? Geophysical Instruments, Class 6675 ? Surveying Equipment, Class 6655 & 6660 ? Geophysical & Meteorological Instruments & Data Collection, Class 6625 ? Noise Measuring Instruments, Class 6630 & 6640 ? Liquid & Gas Analysis Equipment, Class 6665 ? Hazard Detection Equipment.  This standing solicitation allows vendors to submit offers at anytime.  There shall be no closing date for receipt of offers under this solicitation.  This Solicitation is being refreshed to include new and updated clauses pertaining to the Multiple Schedule Program.  The Solicitation can be downloaded  from the Internet at http://www.eps.gov.  The new term ?Evergreen  Contracting? option periods has been added to this Solicitation.  Evergreen contracts provides new policies and procedures to expand the multiyear contracts for all Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) Federal Supply Schedules to one 5 year basic contract period and three separate 5 year option periods. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option to extend the contract for an additional three five (5) years, by providing a written notice to the contractor at least 150 days in advance prior to the expiration of the contract period.  When the Government exercises its option to extend the term of this contract, option prices must be determined fair and reasonable at the time the option is exercised.  The Contracting Officer will obtain a contractor statement that the basis of award customer/Most Favored Customer (MFC) has remained the same and that pricing information provided to negotiate the contract, as updated through any modifications, has not changed unless an adjustment is made in accordance with another contract clause (e.g., Economic Price Adjustment Clause or Price Reduction Clause).  Current contractors are not required to submit an offer under this solicitation issuance.  Contracts awarded under this solicitation will have a contract period beginning on the date of award and will last for a five (5) year period, unless extended under the Evergreen option period, canceled or terminated.

All vendors and/current contractors should be aware that the Evergreen Contracting option period can not be exercised if your items offered are not on the GSA Advantage Electronic Pricelist.   This solicitation has been prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, which implement Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994 (Public Law 103-355), the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-106), and the final rule, published as General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) Change 76, regarding commercial item acquisitions under the Multiple Award Schedule Program.  The contract format and data requirements in this solicitation differ from previous solicitations.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to carefully review the entire solicitation package before submission to ensure compliance with commercial item provisions. Contractors are now required to accept the Government purchase card for payments equal to or less than the micro-purchase threshold for oral and written delivery orders.  Contractors are encouraged to accept the Government purchase card for payment for orders above the micro-purchase threshold.  See GSAR Clause 552.232.77, entitled ?Purchase by Credit Card?. This solicitation contains the new clause ?Contractor?s Report of Sales? (552.238-74), which requires the submission of sales on electronic GSA Form 72A via the Internet and ?Industrial Funding Fee? (IFF) (552.238-76) which requires a 1% payment due on a calendar quarter schedule.  Offerors must include the IFF in their prices.  The fee is included in the award price(s) and reflected in the total amount charged to ordering activities.  GSA has established a contract sales criterion for all Multiple Award Schedules.  Clause I-FSS-639, entitled ?Contract Sales Criteria?, states that a contract will not be awarded if the anticipated sales are not expected to exceed $25,000.  Contracts will also be canceled unless reported sales for each 12-month period from date of award are $25,000 or above.  This Federal Supply Schedule will no longer have a prescribed beginning and ending date.  The schedule period will be continuous, and will contain contracts with contract periods that commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years (exclusion of any options) from the DOA.  Unless otherwise noted in the solicitation, new offers may be forwarded at any time.  All requests for a diskette or hard copy of the solicitation should be faxed to (703) 305-5537, attention: Linda N. Poole.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Innovative Environmental Technologies.  This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), Technology Transfer Division (ERT) under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement is open for one year and will be advertised annually. This announcement seeks out technologies to reduce environmental impacts from current and past Air Force (AF) operations and apply to Air Force installations worldwide. AFCEE is interested in environmental technologies that apply promising field-tested innovative technologies.  This is not to test theoretical concepts of technologies that currently exist in a laboratory research and development (R&D) phase. The following are examples of technologies the AF is interested in, as well as the different contaminates:  Chemical Treatment; Process Optimization; Decision Support Software; Pollution Prevention; Enhanced Bioremediation; Sensors; Permeable Reactive Barrier; Site Characterization; Phytoremediation; Unexploded Ordnance Detection/Clearance; Physical Treatment and others.  Chlorinated Aliphatic Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated Pesticides/Herbicides, Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (DNAPL) Dioxin, Energetics, Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (LNAPL); Metals, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH); polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB) Petroleum Hydrocarbons, perchlorate, Unexploded Ordnance.  

Proposal submittal is a two-phase process.  Phase I Offerors submit proposals by completing a short questionnaire on the AFCEE web page developed specifically to facilitate proposal submittal in the BAA program. The requested information includes:  description of the technology being proposed and a discussion of the technical benefits to include the type of site and specific problem addressed; contamination and media treated; qualifications of the offeror; estimated cost range of the technology.  Limits to the length of each section are noted in the web-based proposal form. Phase I submittals are due NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM CST, 1 NOV 2002.  Phase I submittals received after 1 NOV 2002, but prior to the expiration date of this BAA, may or may not be evaluated.  However, these proposal will be held for possible action until expiration date of this BAA.  The Phase I proposals are evaluated by the Air Force?s Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) using the same selection criteria used to evaluate Phase II proposals. It is critical that the offeror convey the above information accurately and concisely so that proposal evaluators can judge the merits of the proposed demonstration. Those proposals that are judged innovative and meet program requirements are selected for further evaluation in Phase II.  Offerors whose proposals are not selected are notified electronically of this decision, while those selected are similarly notified and invited to submit a Phase II proposal as an attachment to the electronic format provided via Internet link. 

Phase II proposals are to include expanded descriptions/discussion of the following information:  technology proposed including results of previous development/demonstration, pilot-scale or treatability studies.  Described in sufficient detail to enable reviewers to understand the nature and probability of successful application.  To include the types of contaminants treated, the media (i.e., groundwater) treated, and any limitations known to affect the application.  Benefits to the USAF. This should include a comparison with existing technologies used to treat the same contaminants, and how the proposed technology improves cleanup over existing technology and/or lowers the cost of environmental restoration/prevention.  The objectives of the proposed technology field demonstration, the tasks to be accomplished during the demonstration, the project schedule, and the location or type of site recommended for demonstration.
The qualifications of the offeror to successfully perform the technology demonstration.  The above is restricted to ten (10) pages of technical information, exclusive of a title page, 2-page executive summary, 3 pages for resumes of key personnel, and a cost proposal.  The format of the technical proposal will be stated in the electronic submittal form.

Submittals to this BAA shall be through the following Internet address http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/er/baa/baa.asp  . Each electronic form shall address only one technology and one topic. Separate forms shall be submitted for each additional topic or additional technology. Response time for Phase II submittal will be 30 days from electronic notice.  The submittal shall concisely describe the technology and shall be evaluated according to the criteria stated in this announcement. No additional data may be submitted for this BAA. If additional data is submitted, it will be discarded. Abstracts will be evaluated on their own merits and will not be evaluated against each other. The TEB  will evaluate the submittals to this BAA. Vendor submittals that meet all of the evaluation criteria will be accepted into the BAA program. Once accepted into the program, the abstract will be shared with appropriate DOD personnel for consideration. Vendor submittals having a technology or process applicable to a specific environmental need may be asked to contract for a field application. Multiple contracts may result. THERE IS NO COMMITMENT BY THE AIR FORCE EITHER TO MAKE ANY CONTRACT AWARDS OR TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MONEY EXPENDED BY THE OFFEROR BEFORE A CONTRACT AWARD. The abstracts will be evaluated based on the following criteria (listed in descending order of importance): The scientific/technical merits of the proposed technology.   A clear understanding of how the proposed technology will improve upon current commercially available technologies. The cost effectiveness of the technology in comparison with other competing technologies and meets a significant Air Force need.   CRITICAL NOTE: A CONTRACTOR LICENSE/REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED FOR THIS BAA, BUT A CONTRACTOR IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR). NO CONTRACT AWARD WILL BE MADE TO ANY CONTRACTOR THAT IS NOT REGISTERED OR IN THE PROCESS OF REGISTRATING WITH THE DOD CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION.  AN INTERNET LINK IS PROVIDED ON THE QUESTIONAIRRE FOR THE PHASE I SUBMITTAL.  

NOTES: The preceding data should be sufficient for completing an electronic form. There are no solicitation documents applying to this BAA. As no funding for contracts has been reserved in advance, AFCEE will be sharing qualified abstracts with other Federal Government activities to seek sites and funding. Some Federal Government activities may employ civilian contractors to determine the applicability of an offered technology to specific environmental projects. Any information that may be sensitive to review by such personnel should not be submitted. 311th HSW/PKV Contracts Office will reply to all offerors once the (TEB) has reviewed all forms submitted. For questions regarding this BAA, call 311th HSW/PKVCB at (210) 536-5270 or via e-mail maryjo.boldt@brooks.af.mil .

<DESC>Participants are being sought in an ever-changing program of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) called Distributor Partnership. We have issued three distributor partnership solicitations to date. Each solicitation has been slightly different in an attempt to improve upon the previous edition. 
The past Distributor Partnership solicitations were designed to take advantage of commercial off the shelf (COTS) items being held in stock to support commercial customers. Because the items were supposedly already stocked, the solicitations allowed only Direct Vendor Delivery (DVD) to our customers based on a 3 or 10-day delivery period and limited the contract length to 18 months with firm fixed prices for the entire contract period. The initiative has had limited success to this point. What we?ve found is that the majority of our items don?t lend themselves to 3 and 10-day delivery because the vendors don?t routinely stock the items.  The uncertainty of our demand patterns and the often times long lead times caused undue risk to the contract holder.
Many potential sources expressed an interest in expanding this concept to include the potential for shipments to government stock locations and allowing a longer contract period. We intend to formulate a new Distributor Partnership solicitation based upon responses from this survey.
Features we hope to incorporate into the new solicitation include filling stock orders for all National Stock Numbers (NSN) that cannot be delivered in a timely manner using DVD, expanding the contract term to up to 5 years, utilizing a best value evaluation instead of a ?first in? method, and only allowing for a single award per NSN. 
In order to reduce waste and make this effort as productive as possible, a modified approach will be used to determine the actual format of the solicitation(s) to be issued and to identify the candidate list of NSNs. The anticipated process will follow these steps:
1.	Simultaneously issue this letter to known interested sources and issue a Sources Sought notice in the Federal Business Opportunities web site (www.fedbizopps.gov) to explain this initiative.
2.	Obtain a list of candidate items NSNs from potential sources. (The initial list of potential candidate items is due by October 29, 2002.) Candidate items must have an NSN assigned and be managed by S9E. (Potential sources will be asked to provide a list of NSNs for validation. MS Excel is the preferred format for the list.) 
3.	The candidate items will then be reviewed by DSCC to validate that the NSN is managed by S9E, is not currently on a long-term contract, and is coded as a stocked item in our system. The verified list, along with current demand data will be returned to the source that submitted the candidate item for validation.
4.	The potential source will be asked to use the validated list to answer the attached market survey questions and resubmit the information in an electronic format (MS Excel is the preferred spreadsheet format).
5.	A review of all responses will be completed to determine the actual list of NSNs to be included in the pending solicitation(s). (The intent is to solicit on a competitive basis as many of the validated candidate items as possible.)

 
MARKET SURVEY	(Please complete item 6 after the list of NSNs has been validated by DSCC.)

<CONTACT>Sherry Freeman, Contract Specialist, Phone 505 846 7201, Fax 505 846 7041, Email Sherry.Freeman@Kirtland.af.mil - Francisco Tapia, Contracting Officer, Phone 505 846 5021, Fax 505 846 7041, Email Francisco.Tapia@Kirtland.af.mil
<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION: 
The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Space Vehicle Components Branch (VSSV), as part of the Space Vehicle Directorate (VS) at Kirtland AFB NM is interested in receiving proposals in lightweight mirror technology for space-deployable imaging telescopes.  The total program budget for these efforts is approximately $800K over 8 to 15 months. AFRL will make one award. This Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) will remain open 30 days after date of publication.  Open communication with the technical point of contact (POC) is encouraged until proposals are received. AFRL Evaluators may contact an offeror to clarify a point of information before completing the evaluation. 
The Government will provide a site visit on 10 April 2002.  Offerors should contact the Technical POC, Dr. R. Scott Erwin, (505) 846-9816, to make arrangements to participate in the site visit.
B. TECHNICAL TOPIC AREA: 
This technical effort is focused on the development of lightweight mirror systems technology for space-deployable imaging telescope applications. The contractor should consider innovative approaches for the design of stiff, lightweight, space-traceable mirrors that meet the performance requirements of visible imaging applications.   Development of prototype mirrors based on the proposed technology is desired.  AFRL is specifically interested in approaches that addresses the following goals (in order of importance):  ultra-lightweight, high-stiffness mirror structures (technology goals of < 15 kg/m2 areal density, which must factor in any required mechanisms and control electronics, and first natural frequency in test mounting configuration > 80 Hz), applicability to large apertures (technology goal of 0.6 meters diameter circular), ability to achieve desired radius of curvature in mirror structures (technology goal of 5 meters ?b .2% for spherical optics), ability to achieve stringent radius-of-curvature matching between segments (technology goal of < 40 microns differential ROC between 3 segments), ability to provide stringent mirror surface figure error (technology goal relative to a best fit reference sphere ?T ??/4 peak to valley and < ??/40 rms at 633 nm over central 95% clear aperture), visible-quality, space-qualifiable coatings (technology goal is reflectivity of R ?d 90% from 450 - 850 nm at normal incidence, with no visible pinholes or defects in surfaces when viewed without magnification over central 95% clear aperture, with durability performance equivalent or greater to that of standard aluminum coatings),  low surface roughness (technology goal ?T 20 angstroms rms over central 95% clear aperture), stringent mirror surface quality (technology goal better than 40-20 scratch ?V dig over central 95% clear aperture), low complexity approaches (i.e. non-actuated), low thermal gradient sensitivity mirror structures (i.e. low thermal expansion or high conductivity), and approaches that offer significant improvements in manufacturing time to current commercial mirror fabrication techniques.
Offerors must propose development, design, fabrication, and test three (3) prototype mirrors that address all of the above technology goals to be acceptable for award.  These mirrors must be compatible with a 3 point mechanical mounting interface, to be provided by AFRL, that will allow further test and evaluation by the Government.  Offerors should contact the Technical POC Dr. R. Scott Erwin, AFRL/VSSV, 505-846-9816, fax 505-846-7877, email: richard.erwin@kirtland.af.mil to obtain a description of the mounting interface and planned AFRL testing configuration.  
All measurement units presented to the Air Force should use the meter-kilogram-second (MKS) system.

No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the successful proposal. Once the evaluation is completed, all proposals will be categorized as one of the following: (i) Category I: Well conceived, scientifically and technically sound proposals pertinent to program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals. (ii) Category II: Scientifically or technically sound proposals requiring further development and are recommended for acceptance, but are at a lower priority than Category I; (iii) Category III: Proposals not technically sound or do not meet agency needs.  Subject to the availability of funds, AFRL reserves the right to select for award any, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. When requested, a debriefing will be provided IAW FAR 15.505 and 15.506.
E. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: 

While the Government reserves the right to award a procurement instrument best suited to the nature of the research proposed, a Cost Plus Fixed-Fee Completion contract of 8 to 15 months duration is anticipated. The offeror shall include their recommendation and rationale for the type of instrument proposed in the proposal.  In the event the Government is unable to conclude negotiations with the apparent successful offeror, it reserves the right to conduct negotiations with another acceptable offeror.   
It is anticipated that contractors may have access to or may generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws. Therefore, only offerors who are certified by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) may submit proposals.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Office of the Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems (OPM-CAS) and the U.S. Army HQ, Operations Support Command (HQ, OSC) are seeking interested sources for a proposed three phase contractual effort in support of the M864 Projectile Re capitalization Program.  The first phase of this effort will explore the feasibility of downloading M864 projectiles, removing the M223 fuze from grenades, attaching Self Destruct Fuzes (SDFs) to grenades, assembling a V-Thread Repair Ring, and final Load,  Assemble and Pack (LAP) of the M864 projectile.  Following the first phase, the second and third phases will be dedicated to supporting the Materiel Change and Type Classification efforts for the M864 projectile. These latter two phases focus on the quali fication of two sources for  SDFs to be used on the M42 and M46 dual-purpose grenades.  Tasks under this program include, but are not limited to: Phase I: Feasibility Study 1.	Download of (250) M864 projectiles using a process representative of production whereby the original quality condition of major components and assemblies such as the Body and Ogive Assembly, Base Burner Assembly and Grenades remains intact.  This proces s must demonstrate the potential to support the LAP of 30,000 M864 projectiles per year.  2.	Download of (250) M483A1 projectiles using a process representative of production.  This process must demonstrate the potential to support the LAP of 30,000 M864 projectiles per year. 3.	Removal of the grenade stabilizer and M223 fuze from all HE M42/M46 grenades downloaded in paragraphs 1 and 2 above using a process representative of production that leaves the original quality of the grenade studs intact.  This process must demonstrate  the potential to support the LAP of 30,000 M864 projectiles per year. 4.	Build (7,200) Grenades, GP: M46, INERT. 5.	Remove the stabilizer and Inert M223 fuze from all (7,200) Inert M46 grenades assembled in paragraph 4 above using the process identified in paragraph 3.  Follow this process by attaching INERT XM236 SDFs to all 7200 grenades. 6.	Assemble (90) Modified Projectile Subassemblies with the V-Thread Repair Ring IAW drawing to be provided with Request for Proposal.  These subassemblies will then be assembled into (90) complete M864 projectiles using grenades from paragraph 5 above. Th e process shall be representative of production that demonstrates the potential to support the LAP of 30,000 M864 projectiles per year. Phase II - Materiel Change 1.	Build (1200) Grenades, GP: M46, INERT. 2.	LAP (16) Inert M864 projectiles.  Each M864 projectile will consist of INERT M46 grenades from paragraph 1 above, a LIVE baseburner assembly and LIVE expulsion charge.  3.	Modify the studs on (5500) Body Assembly, Type CA IAW Modified Stud drawing to be provided with the Request for Proposal. 4.	Review competing SDF designs with the responsible contractor.  Such issues as design, operability, and safety relative to the M864 LAP process shall be addressed.  5.	Assemble each of two SDF designs to INERT M46 body loading assemblies from paragraph 3 above and LAP into M864 projectiles for each SDF test iteration; (76) projectiles total. Phase III: Type Classification  1.	Assemble each of two SDF designs to HE M42 and M46 body loading assemblies from Phase I, paragraph 3 above and LAP into (446) M864 projectiles to support Qualification Testing.   2.	Build (2000) Grenades, GP: M46, INERT. 3.	LAP (24) Inert M864 projectiles with INERT M46 grenades from paragraph 2 above, LIVE baseburner assemblies and LIVE expulsion charges. 4.	Modify the studs on (16,500) Body Assembly, Type CA IAW Modified Stud drawing to be issued with the Request for Proposal. 5.	Assemble each of the two SDF designs to INERT M46 body loading assemblies from paragraph 4 above and LAP into (228) Inert M864 projectiles to support Qualification Testing. 6.	Maintain a quality management system in accordance with ISO 9001:2000.  The above liste d tasks are not all inclusive and hardware quantities are subject to change.  A copy of the complete draft Statement of Work (SOW) may be obtained by request from the Procuring Contracting Officer, Norman Brown, email brownn@osc.army.mil or telephone (309)  782-3709 or from Jan Tedell, email tedellj@osc.army.mil, telephone (309) 782-3587. In its evaluation to determine the successful offeror under this procurement the Government will consider the following factors: 	Ability to download and modify projectiles 	Ability to modify grenades and fuzes 	Ability to LAP projectiles at the required quantities Within ten (10) days of advertisement of this requirement all interested bidders should provide the contracting officer a letter of interest along with a brief description of the firms capabilities, including a description of facilities, personnel and past  experience.

In April 2000, former President Clinton signed E.O. 13148 "The Greening the  Government through Leadership in Environmental Management" which established a  five year EMS implementation goal for all Federal Facilities.  In July 2001,  the Department of the Army published policy guidance on EMS implementation  establishing ISO 14001 implementation by December 2005 as an Army Goal and full  conformance to the standard by 2009.    ISO 14001 consists of a series of voluntary standards addressing the creation  and maintenance of an Environmental Management System. These standards require  companies to establish an environmental policy, determine the environmental  aspects and impacts of product/activities/services, plan environmental  objectives and measurable targets, work on implementation of programs to meet  these objectives and measurable targets, and create a system of corrective  action and management review.  Technical Requirements / ISO 14001 Implementation Activities: The Contractor implementation assistance experience should include performing  baseline assessments to review the status of the installations EMS with regard  to ISO 14001 requirements, developing programs/implementation plans to achieve  ISO conformance, developing objectives and targets, identifying significant  aspects and impacts of the installations operations, Internal Auditing training  and assistance, ISO general awareness briefings, Executive briefings to  management, implementation team training, and various reviews and report  development. Experience with Army and other DOD installations, Program/Project  Manager Offices (PMs) / Program Executive Offices (PEOs) preferred. Knowledge  of Army weapon system acquisition process and policies preferred. This is a market survey, not a pre-solicitation notice. If a formal  solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be  published. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the  Government by November 15, 2002.

<DESC>F-16 Radar Antenna Motor System Request for Information

This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI).  The Air Force is considering replacement of the existing Azimuth and Elevation Motor system on the APG-68 radar antennas with a more reliable, longer life brushless motor system with up to a ten-year warranty.  We are looking for a system that would offer "best value" to the government, not necessarily lowest procurement cost.  This brushless motor system would incorporate brushless motor technology and must address any required changes to the electrical interface (i.e. motor drive electronics, wiring, etc).  Contractors can expect modification validation, system integration and testing by the APG-68 OEM (Northrop-Grumman Corp) and are encouraged to work closely and/or partner with the OEM.  The following information is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting a market survey of industry to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Hill AFB, Utah.  This is not a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid.
We are seeking contractors who are interested in designing and manufacturing high reliability brushless motor systems using modern technology rather than traditional build to print requirements.  The F-16 Logistics Operations Division, Radar Section has a requirement for as many as 1500 systems.  These new motors will replace the current Azimuth Motors (NSN 6105-01-154-8955, P/N 585R911G01) and Elevation Motors (NSN 6105-01-154-8956, P/N 585R912G01).  The antenna motors are part of the Array Gimbal Assembly, which is a subassembly of the Antenna Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) of the F-16 AN/APG-68 radar systems.  The current Azimuth DC Motors and Elevation DC Motors (two per axis) use metal tape speed reduction drives and paired gimbal bearings to provide the gimbal motion for the antenna.  
Interested parties are requested to submit two copies of a summary of the capabilities and facilities they have which will allow them to perform the development and manufacture of the new motors.  Rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimates are also solicited as an aid in the budgeting process and should include a figure for the units priced both with and without a ten-year warranty.  The requested information is for planning purposes only, and the contractor will not be bound by these preliminary estimates.  This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished.  The government does not intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Written responses must be submitted by 18 November 2002 to OO-ALC/LGKE, ATTN: Lorraine Vernon, 6072 Fir Ave, and Hill AFB, UT 84056-5820.  A top-level drawing set describing the current Azimuth Motor and Elevation Motors and associated electronics are available.  No telephone or fax requests will be accepted.  
For answers to technical questions regarding this effort or to obtain the top-level drawing set, please contact Lt. Mike Weinheimer at 775-4613, e-mail Michael.Weinheimer@hill.af.mil. For answers to contractual questions, please contact Lorraine Vernon at (801) 777-5777, e-mail lorraine.Vernon@hill.af.mil.

<CONTACT>Keith Surber, Dir, Denver Contracting Operations, Phone 303-672-5281 x1866, Fax 303-672-5062, Email Keith_W._Surber@hud.gov
<DESC>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has a requirement for technical services, to be performed in Washington, DC, to support HUD's Financial Consolidated Reporting System (FCRS).  HUD's FCRS is comprised of Hyperion Enterprise commercial off-the-shelf products and one customized application.  The Hyperion products utilized at HUD are: Hyperion Enterprise, Hyperion Enterprise Reporting, Hyperion Application Link (HAL), Hyperion Essbase and HypFACTS II.  HypFACTS II is a custom application that utilizes Essbase and Application Link.  

The FCRS was established as a tool to assist CFO users in the development of complex financial reports.  The system was implemented in 1997, and the first consolidated statements were issued to Treasury in 1998.  The system allows the user to transfer large volumes of financial data downloaded from the HUD Central Accounting and Program System, manipulate the data, and establish repeatable report formats.  The system enables the CFO to meet the following requirements:  Provide the FACTS II reporting timeline to United States Department of Treasury; Provide on-line auditor access to HUD's financial statements to support the annual financial statement audit; Provide the capability to report data by fund, entity, and major program.

The technical support service required includes assisting the CFO user community in complying with U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Management and Budget, and Office of Inspector General reporting schedules.  The contractor support services require a knowledge of federally mandated crosswalks, edits and time schedules for the production of financial statements, FACTS I and FACTS II reports and SF-133 report formats for internal HUD usage.  Technical services will include:  providing end-user support during the Quarterly Reporting Cycle to ensure the timely and accurate delivery of Edited Bulk Files to Treasury; identifying changes mandated by the U.S. Department of Treasury each quarter, and updating the HypFACTS II application and related supporting software for compliance with Treasury requirements; confirming the posted requirements are current per the Treasury's Financial Management Service;  modifying software prior to being delivered to HUD;  delivering an updated version of the HypFACTS II application reflecting Treasury-mandated edits; ensuring the updated software is successfully tested on the HUD development server prior to being released to the production server;  providing updated HypFACTS II software application; providing on-site technical/user support and conducting periodic training.  HUD anticipates the performance period will be one-year with four one-year option periods.

Interested parties must notify the Contracting Officer via email at the following address:  keith_w._surber@hud.gov.  With the email notification of interest, parties shall also provide their qualifications sufficient to ascertain the vendor may be able to perform the requirements stated above, identify whether the vendor is large or small, and, if applicable, the vendor's GSA schedule number. If sufficient GSA sources are identified, HUD will purchase from the schedule.

<DESC>The National Data Buoy Center (NDBC), Stennis Space Center, Mississippi is conducting a market survey to locate viable boat yards interested in sandblasting and painting National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) buoys.  These boat yards will be solicited for pricing information to establish a baseline of current market rates for sandblasting and painting 3-, 6-, 10- and 12-meter buoys in the local area.  Due to the need to transport the buoys to and from the boat yards, it is preferred that the boat yard be within 100 to 150 miles of Stennis Space Center, Mississippi.  The 3- and 6-meter buoys are truckable while the 10- and 12-meter buoys must be towed to the yard.  The 3-meter buoys are all aluminum discus buoys with a diameter of 10 feet and weighing 2,900 lbs.  The 6-meter buoys are all aluminum boat shaped buoys.  Each 6-meter buoy is 20 feet by 8 feet by 8 feet and weighs 8,700 lbs.  The 10-meter buoys are steel with aluminum superstructure discus buoys 33 feet in diameter and weigh 57,000 lbs without blast.  The 12-meter buoys are steel with aluminum superstructure discus buoys 40 feet in diameter and weigh 104,000 lbs without blast.  Both the 10 and 12-meter buoys must be deblasted prior to lifting.  NDBC will provide specifications and drawings to interested parties upon request.  Requesters will be asked to provide quotations on the information package provided.  The quotations will be used to establish a market rate for the sandblasting and painting work.   The Government gives preference to small businesses.  All requests must be in writing sent by e-mail, mail, or fax.  Phone requests will not be honored.  Address requests to Penny S. Parker, National Data Buoy Center, Building 1100, Stennis Space Center, MS  39529-6000.  Fax number is (228) 688-3153. E-mail address is Penny.Parker@noaa.gov.

<SUBJECT>D -- Human Resources Automation System
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  SOURCES SOUGHT.  The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Office of Acquisition Management, in response to a request for our Office of Personnel, is seeking sources capable of providing an integrated automated solution for workforce management.  Essentially, the DEA requires a COTS system/extranet services for Classification, Recruitment/Staffing, and Performance Optimization of Government personnel within DEA.  The services being sought are similar to those provided by Avue Technologies, under their Classification, Recruitment/Staffing, and Performance Optimization Modules.  Vendors should describe the details of their system/services, service availability, as well as the size of the company.  The system should have the following capabilities:  1) designed first for use by the Federal Government as opposed to a system developed for commercial use; 2) user-friendly; 3) capable of exchanging data and communicating with other DEA systems and software; 4) Classification capabilities shall allow for assistance with Government personnel classification, pay, basic performance management, and employee development that automates the processes involved in creating positions and provides key documentation related to the position, analyzes a position and determines likely relationships between duties, job classification, compensation level, performance standards, employee development activities, and training.  This classification functionality shall be available to line managers at the desktop.  After the analysis is complete, this module produces integrated documents such as Position Description, Evaluation Statement, Performance Plan, Training Plan, Staffing Crediting Plan, and Interview Questions.  The services shall provide for the intake, rating, ranking, and referral of applicants.  Each job is dynamically built and edited and, when approved, this position is posted to one or more centralized web site recruitment pages.  The system shall also simultaneously build a custom job application based on the specific requirements of the position that applicants will fill-out on-line and submit for rating and ranking.  The system will enable applicants to load their personal data (such as a resume or SF-171 type data) for later retrieval and matching with specific vacancies of their choice.  The system shall have the capability to provide electronic notices throughout the staffing and hiring process to users within the DEA as well as to the applicant, using information developed from the applicant, core activities, and information provided by other systems. The system shall have the capability to review all applicants and produce a list of qualified applicants and highly qualified applicants for the Government hiring manager, which can be electronically delivered to the Government manager.  The system shall be capable of adjusting the lists based on regulatory requirements to take into consideration special priorities such as veteran's preference, eligibility requirements, and priority placement programs.  The system shall be capable of providing ?open and continuous? recruitment features such that applicants can define their interest so that they are informed, by email, when positions are posted which meet their interest profile.  Applicant information should be contained in a centralized database and queried at any time.  The system shall also provide an applicant supply file to store and retrieve applicants with previously determined skill sets and competencies for open positions.  In addition, each staffing action is electronically archived and maintained by the Office of Personnel, or maintained for that office by the vendor.  4) The Performance Optimization aspect of the system shall be capable of providing specific strategic goals to organizational units that cascade down into individual position performance objectives, track specific project milestones and/or assigned performance feedback dates and notify both employees and managers of such deadlines to collect information regarding the degree to which performance objectives are met.  The system shall track overall or organizational performance by ?rolling up? achievements from individual performance ratings into a consolidated organizational view.  This system shall provide for electronic performance appraisal and automatically query employees to provide feedback and input into the appraisal process during the course of the appraisal period.  Employee contributions would be compiled and delivered as reports to the manager.  Appraisals shall be tracked and, where necessary, performance deficiencies are evaluated and improvement plans shall be generated to provide employees with specific skill- and knowledge-building activities and training to bring performance levels to full proficiency.  This process will serve as a tool for managing awards processing. 5) Overall system specifications include a) the ability to access data through Internet Explorer or Netscape, b) Canned and Ad Hoc reporting capabilities, c) Physical Data Center Security as well as secure transmission and storage of data all at points, d) all hardware such as Routers, Switches, Storage Devices, e) 24x7x365 help desk support, f) access by external parties (such as job applicants), g) Microsoft?s .Net and Java2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) compliant, and h) have XML data interchange capability.  6) Upon termination of the contract, all data will be delivered to the DEA for it?s future use or record keeping.  The services shall be available to approximately 10,000 DEA employees.  Support contractors that supplement the DEA?s human resources department shall be able to access and utilize this product, but will not use it for their own employment classification, staffing, or performance management activities.  The number of outside applicants should be considered infinite.. The system shall be accessible from all DEA offices to include HQ, Field Divisions, Resident Offices, and District Offices.  Payments for services received (monthly maintenance) will be made only after services have been completed, or as established by industry practices.   Interested parties shall provide the contracting office, no later than 4 pm October 31, 2002, evidence of their capability to perform the contract, and a statement of the size of their company.  All interested parties shall respond to this notice in writing.  No telephone responses will be accepted.
