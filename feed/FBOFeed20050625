<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Institute on Urban Health Research, Boston, MA.

Purpose:

This  requirement is for the development, production and dissemination of an informational brochure on Hispanic drug abuse targeted for service providers. 

The information source for the brochure will be the recently completed National Strategic Plan on Hispanic Drug Abuse Research.  The purpose of the Strategic Plan was threefold: (1) to increase our understanding of drub abuse research among Hispanics, (2) to identify scientific opportunities in drug abuse research among Hispanics, and (3) to highlight needs and strategies for supporting the training and mentoring of young Hispanic scientists in drug abuse research. This Strategic Plan came to fruition under the direction of Dr. Hortensia Amaro, Distinguished Professor at the Bouve College of Health Sciences and Director of the Institute on Urban Health Research (IUHR) at Northeastern University, in collaboration with the National Hispanic Science Network (NHSN) and other scientists in Hispanic drug abuse research under the auspices of the Robert Wood Johnson foundation. By providing a scholarly review of existing research, locating gaps in research and training, and identifying opportunities for scientific development, the document hopes to guide and inform the scientific agenda of major funders of drug abuse research. The Strategic Plan is comprised of eight chapters that address critical areas of Hispanic drug abuse research: epidemiology, neuroscience, prevention, treatment, blending of research and practice, services, HIV/AIDS prevention, and training of research scientists. These areas were identified by an expert panel under the guidance of the National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse Steering Committee and with input from the membership of the NHSN. The expert panel consisted of 11 senior research scientists who are leaders in drug abuse research and the training of Hispanic scientists. Eight working groups were formed under the leadership and guidance of one or two members of the expert panel. Each working group produced one chapter for a total of eight chapters. Chapters were reviewed by independent experts in the field and revisions made accordingly.   The Strategic Plan will be disseminated to the scientific community through journal articles in major substance abuse research journals. It has also been distributed to the NIDA and RWJ leadership so that they may consider recommendations on needed research.
The Institute on Urban Health Research (IUHR) was founded in response to serious and largely unmitigated disparities in the level of overall health and health care found in urban populations, particularly those of the urban poor, African-American and Latino communities. Under the direction of Dr. Hortensia Amaro, IUHR conducts research on health issues that disproportionately impact urban communities, particularly the urban poor, African-American and Hispanic communities.  Accordingly, the Institute's research focuses on racial and ethnic health disparities and the cultural and community contextual factors that affect health status and health-care access. The IUHR at Northeastern University promotes excellence in interdisciplinary community-based and basic research that leads to strategies that improve health in urban communities through a better understanding of the causes of disease, racial and ethnic health disparities and characteristics of urban environments related to health.
IUHR is the sole source capable of performing the tasks necessary for completion of this contract, specifically, the development, production and dissemination of this informational brochure.  
IUHR  has the proprietary the knowledge of the Hispanic population within substance abuse settings, and is the only source that has the expertise needed in order to develop this type of informational brochure for service providers treating Hispanics in substance abuse treatment, on the topic at hand.

This market survey is a challenge to Academia to explore applications of  technology and to foster development in areas of interest to the Army. The following areas are not all-inclusive, but are a synopsis of the various topics and Science and Technology Objectives which are of interest to this command: -ARMAMENTS 1) Ballistic Impact Dynamic Modeling of Fabric for New Protection Systems: Develop innovative design tool for evaluating the performance of fabrics that will be used in improved ballistic systems against protection systems against current and future threats.  - ARMED UNMANNED VEHICLES 2)  Multi-Platform Manned/Unmanned System-Mission Planner/Controller: Develop a mission planner and controller for multiple manned /unmanned systems. This planner will receive tasking information for a combined group of manned and unmanned vehicles(UVs) treated as a single system(i.e. a Reconnaissance,  Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RTSA) -BATTLESPACE AWARENESS 3)  Advanced Algorithms for Prediction, Display and Visualization of Moving Targets: Develop 4-D terrain- and mobility-based targeting algorithms that will optimize the display of information to enable a single operator to manage the tracking and targeting of multiple ground and sea surface, and air targets, such that time critical moving targets may be attacked with both precision guided and non-precision guided munitions with a high probability of success. 4) Innovative Intelligence Agent and Cognitive Decision Aids Component Technology for Net Centric Fires: Develop real time intelligent agent based algorithms and reusable code components that can provide the basis for developing the next generation of intelligent ,network centric fires management, execution and control software for Future Combat System  applications  5) Wide Area Optical High Speed Scanning Sensor System for Rapid Response in Urban Battlefield Conditions: Develop a rapid response scanning optical Anti- Personnel sensor system capable of rapid identification, classification and directed response against enemy personnel, achieving a substantial force  multiplier for soldiers in MOUT operations. 6) Transient Battlefield Effects Classifier for Precision Target Location in Networked Sensor Systems: Develop a time domain based classification algorithm suitable for multiple sensor types, capable of reliably classifying transient  signals emitted from threat sources on the battlefield, allowing networked  sensors to substantially improve the accuracy of their target location/tracking  solution and promising a more dynamic and revealing overall assessment of  events on the battlefield.  7) Rugged Multi-Chip Module (MCM) for Hyperspectural Imager: Research and develop and design a rugged , low power MCM package for acquisition, processing and displaying hyperspectural image data for the war fighter. The MCM shall contain the adaptable and real-time reconfigurable digital signal processing engine and all support circuits, interconnection, assembly and connectors in a self contained package. 8) Visual Physiology Applied to Long Wave Infrared Imaging: Explore and determine the optimal location of three narrow multi-spectral bands in the Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) region, i.e. 7 to 14 microns, that can be fused and the  method of fusion to most nearly provide a person similar information that that he would see daylight. Develop micro size hardware system that fuses and  displays the imagery at video rates. 9) Disposable /Survivable Antenna Technology: Design an antenna or antenna system capable of delivering high power microwave energy in hostile situations. 10) Target image Transformation and Transfer: To determine a methodology to resize, transform, compress and transfer the image of a target and associated  reference points from a Fire Control System to an autonomous small caliber  projectile and store the image in the projectile.  -IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES (IEDs)/ASYMMETRIC THREATS 11) Proactive or offensive approach to defeating the IED threat Design and develop technologies or concepts that interdict early in the life cycle of the enemy's IED development and emplacement. This would include static emplacement as well as suicide bombers (Human Borne IEDs and Vehicle Borne  IEDs).  In addition, concepts for detecting IEDs prior to emplacement or IED components prior to assembly; detecting facilities or vehicles involved in the development or manufacturing process, and concepts for preventing the supply of components or emplacement of assembled IEDs. -CF/FF GUN & MUNITIONS 12) Novel Actuation Technologies for Guided Precision Munitions Develop: novel methods and devices for affecting flight trajectory correction in guided munitions without requiring actuation components that occupy a considerable volume and consume a significant amount of electrical power. The actuation methods and devices being sought are aimed at being used for subsonic projectiles such as mortars. 13) Smart Self Configuring Miniature Widescreen: Develop a miniature widescreen design based on MEMS, micro-machine, or other smart materials/electronics designs which allows automatic detection of the aggravating dynamic effects of wind noise and then specifically counteracts those effects through dynamic self- configuration/self-regulation in real time. 14) Conformal Semiconductor Circuits for Future Combat Systems (FCS) Advanced Munitions: To develop rugged , low cost electronic circuits, including  transistors, microwave and millimeter wave structures, and optoelectric devices that could be applied conformal to curved or otherwise non-planar surfaces for munitions applications. The primary objective is to develop a means to write, print or deposit electronic circuits with active elements on outer surfaces of munitions or on the inside surface of parabolic mirrors for communications and/or sensing applications. 15) Polymer Materials for Small Arms Cartridge Cases: To identify and develop an optimal cost-effective polymer based material system, an efficient  lightweight polymer small arms (5.56 mm and 7.62mm) cartridge case design and  an economical fabrication process that will result in more than thirty percent (30%) weight saving per cartridge over the existing brass cased cartridge. 16) Novel Low-Cost Full Position and Angular Orientation Sensors for Guidance and Control of Precision Munitions:  Develop novel concepts for low-cost, non GPS based, full position and angular orientation sensors for guidance and  control of smart and precision munitions. The sensors are desired to be small, require low power and occupy small volumes for application in small to large  caliber munitions. 17) Extended Operational Performance of Linear-Beam Amplifiers: To maximize the peak output power of existing linear-beam amplifiers without degrading either  frequency response or bandwidth. Power levels in excess of 250kW are desired. -MANUFACTING SCIENCE 18) Science Based Manufacturing Define, develop and design legacy and emerging materials, equipment, processes  and procedures for the manufacture of weapons and ammunition.  This information must be captured so that it can readily be transferred to another producer.  -NOVEL/DIRECTED ENERGY 19) Hybrid Soldier Power Source: Novel Concepts are being sought for methods and devices to harvest electrical energy during locomotion for hybrid power systems for soldiers. The power must provide a power source that is safe and light weight. The power source must not provide a thermal signature, be cumbersome, increase fatigue or interfere with the free movement of the user. 20) Performance Enhancements for Explosively Driven Magnetic Flux Compression Generators: Design and Develop an improved performance Magnetic Flux Compression Generator 21) L-BAND High Power Amplifiers for Directed Energy Weapons: Commercially available high average power broadcasting amplifiers are specifically designed and configured for compatibility with existing fixed-site broadcast equipment and more importantly, comply with the tight broadcasting specifications  mandated by the FCC. -NANOTECHNOLOGY 22) Novel Dielectric material Enhancement: Design and develop enhancements to current dielectric materials increasing their performance through changes in  chemical make-up, crystal structure and surface finishing. -HOMELAND DEFENSE  23)  Delivery of Inorganic and Microbial Regents to Surface Environments: Develop methods to transport inorganic reagents (metal and metal oxide  particles) and microbes to targeted soil and ground water locations, for  decontamination of chemically polluted subsurface environments The overall objective is to create relationships with the targeted universities. This market research is an effort to introduce the aforementioned  institutions to the technology trends available here at RDEC. Although these  concepts are considered basic research, it is desirable to mature these  concepts for possible future program insertion.
