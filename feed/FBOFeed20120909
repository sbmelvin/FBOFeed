<p>BASIC SERVICE<br />Basic service is defined as that set of capabilities that are inherent within the base price and shall not be unbundled from the base price. The basic service prices shall consist of all access, transport, and applicable discretionary surcharges and fees. Basic service shall also include<br />management and operations; transition and migration and implementation; and reporting functions unless specified otherwise in this contract. Basic services prices shall also exclude any taxes and End User Common Line (EUCL) charges that may apply.</p>
<p>Universal Service Fund (USF) and Pre-subscribed Inter-exchange Carrier Charges (PICC) are considered as part of the basic service prices.</p>
<p>The Pricing Tables shall be used by the offeror to identify the price of service and the mandatory taxes, surcharges, and fees that will be billed to the Government or Government end-user. The information provided in these tables, excluding mandatory taxes, will be considered in the evaluation of the offerors proposal. Any other charges not included in the pricing tables and supporting documents submitted by the offeror shall not be allowed for the term of this contract.</p>
<p>FEATURES<br />Features are capabilities that are offered beyond the basic service to be selected at the option of the user. Other charges are non-service specific non-recurring charges associated with service provisioning in accordance to the best commercial practices, may include, but are not limited to charges associated with changing the features assigned to a line, processing a service order request on an expedited basis, etc. The offeror may also provide optional products and services that are within the scope of this contract but are not identified in the price tables.</p>
<p>OTHER CHARGES<br />Charges for Other Direct Costs (ODCs) shall be established on an individual-case basis, in accordance with Other Direct Costs. Examples of ODCs include provision of services and materials to prepare sites for service and equipment. Repeated use of an ODC, for the same type of task, is prohibited and will lead to a contract modification and the establishment of a new CLIN.</p>
<p>The Cost Proposal shall provide a cost breakout that, at a minimum, justifies the cost identified by any labor category (including wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit).</p>
<p>All non-price evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price; however, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the proposed price may become the determining factor for award.<br /><br />The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions; however, this does not preclude the Government from having discussions if it is in the best interest of the Government to do so.<br /><br />PROPOSAL SUBMISSION<br /><br />Proposals are to provide the requested information in a brief and succinct manner, making every effort to present information clearly and concisely. Proposals should address the requirements of the project consistent with the evaluation criteria described in this Solicitation. Lengthy narratives containing extraneous information are discouraged. All information shall be submitted in English. Proposals that do not follow this format or otherwise include documentation that is difficult to read, may be rejected or may result in a lower evaluation rating.<br /><br />The Offeror shall submit a separate technical and cost proposal that addresses the Statement of Work. Proposals are due by 4:00 p.m.. EST on September 14, 2012 via email to Delfina St Clair at Delfina.St.Clair@nlrb.gov or by regular mail. Proposals should be submitted in either Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Word 2007.

POC: SFC Jason Levi at 760-380-4472 <BR> <BR>The award decision is based on evaluation factors that are tailored to the acquisition. Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PAST PERFORMANCE #2: PRICE #3: DELIVERY. PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as: THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS  10 Sep 2012 1600 EST.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br><br><br><br>The 149th Fighter Wing has a requirement for a 8 month aircraft wash and corrosion prevention of the F-16 aircraft.  There will be a total of 8 washes per month for a total of 84 washes for the 8 month period.  The contractor shall perform wash services at the 149th Fighter Wing as defined in the Performance Work Statement.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 488190 with a small business size standard of $30M annually.  This requirement will be a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  A firm fixed price contract will be awarded as a result of this solicitation.  This RFQ has a total of 1 line item for the 8 month period, please provide pricing for the 8 months of washes per wash to include labor and all other expenses involved.  The award will run for a period of 8 months from the date of award.  Award date should be prior to 15 October 2012 and the Government intends for the award to run from 15 October 2012 - June 15, 2013, however this period is contingent upon funds availability.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The two factors which will be used to evaluate offers are: Price and Past Performance.  Price and past performance will be approximately equal weight in the determination of the award.   The criteria for evaluation is below: <br> Offerors shall include 3-5 references from recent and relevant contracts to include with their offer a brief description of performance and a good POC for that reference to include full name and phone number.  For a contract to be considered recent, the contract must have been performed within the last three (3) years, July 2010 - July 2012.  Definition of relevant for this particular requirement is contracts that are similar or greater in scope and magnitude that the effort described in this solicitation as follows:  <br>Very Relevant = Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope, magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  <br>Relevant = Present/past performance effort involved much of the same scope, magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. <br>Somewhat Relevant = Present/past performance effort involved some of the same scope, magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  <br>Not Relevant = Present/past performance effort did not involve any of the same scope, magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  <br>Scope, Magnitude and Complexity will be determined in regards to the similarity between the contractor's previous contracts (past performance) and that which will be performed in accordance with this particular project and this particular PWS.  An assessment process will take place to review all offeror's price and past performance.  This assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment of one of the following ratings:  Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence.  Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record that is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be obtained shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.  <br>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE = Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  <br>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE = Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has an expection that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br>LIMITED CONFIDENCE = Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  <br>NO CONFIDENCE = Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.  <br>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE = No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.  <br>Basis for Contract Award:  Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price.  This price shall be broken into per wash pricing and the total overall pricing lump sum amount of the total 8 months of service.  After pricing comparison the Government will then move onto past performance.  If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating and is determined to be responsible, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at that point.  Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration or any other offers.  If the low offeror is not found to have a "Substantial Confidence" rating than the Government will make an integrated best value award decision at that time by assessing the offers that are next in line.  Offerors are encouraged and cautioned to submit sufficient information on their past performance to aid them in the assessment process.  The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.  The Government however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in it's best interest.  <br>PROVISIONS/CLAUSES:  The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Item, applies to this acquisition.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility.

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as: THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 11 SEP 2012 at 1100 PST.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS/NOTICE OF INTENT
The Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Integrated and International Energy Analysis (OEA, EI-35), in the Energy Information Administration (EIA) has a requirement for a subscription service that will enable access to proprietary analysis, data, support, and analyst input to FACTS products, published by Facts Global Energy. 
The Government intends to award a sole source purchase in order to FACTS GLOBAL ENERGY (FACTS INC.) in mid September 2012. The period of performance for this award will consist of a twelve (12) month base year.  This award will not exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.  Performance shall commence no later than 15 days from the date of award.
FACTS INC will provide high quality, in depth access through a full membership to online services for the following: China Oil and Gas Service; East of Suez Oil Services; Short Term Global Oil Service.  
EIA staff relies on the timeliness, canvas of data, forecast analysis, and accurate trade-related analysis that this information provides. Policy makers and EIA staff alike rely on this information and the sources for research in publications. FACTS INC is uniquely qualified, and provides comparable data compared to other leading names, but at a better value and with more in-depth coverage of regional areas of interest-China and Iran.. This purchase is meant to support the DOE mission and maintain the public trust. 
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 424920 - Book, Periodical, and Newspaper Merchant Wholesalers. 	
In accordance with Competition in Contracting Act, 41 USC 253 [c] [1], as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, other than full and open competition is authorized when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.
This is a NOTICE OF INTENT; however, interested parties may submit a capability statement or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency by Monday, September 17, 2012 at Noon, 12:00pm (Eastern) via e-mail to Danielle.Hicks@hq.doe.gov. The written response must include a general statement for services mentioned in this announcement and past performance information for relevant work. A determination by the Government to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.
