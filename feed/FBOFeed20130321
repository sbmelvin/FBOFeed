Conditions exist for waiver of First Article.  Solicitation, SPRTA1-13-R-0257, will specify the conditions under which First Articles may be waived. QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS: Yes EXPORT CONTROLLED: Yes QUALIFIED SOURCE(S): Competitive Acquisition, Small Business Set aside and Current approved sources are:  Ferrotherm Co., 13779, SB - LPI Corp., 1CG22, SB - Budney Co. Inc., 29795, SB - ABA Industries, 28884, SB - Tss Technology Inc., 31340, SB - Birken Mfg Co., 51992, SB - Union Machine Co., 8U485, SB - Columbia Mfg Inc., 9Y765, SB - Numet Machine Technology, 06959, SB - Flanagan Brothers. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Justification: supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price, technical, and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download at www.fbo.gov. Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to the buyer, Miranda Dillard 405-734-8098, Miranda.dillard@tinker.af.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), Fort Dix, New Jersey 08640-5000, on behalf of the Project Manager for Close Combat Systems, intends to issue a Other than Full and Open Competition Request for Proposal (RFP) for a single five (5) year, Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with priced range quantities for the manufacturing, inspection, testing and delivery of the FMU-153A/B Point Detonating Delay (PD/DLY) Fuze. The estimated maximum contract value will be $21,432,390 with a guaranteed minimum of $201,000.  The applicable NAICS code for this effort is 332993 and the FSC code is 1390.  The NSN for the FMU-153 A/B PD/DLY Fuze is 1390-01-616-2581.  This acquisition will contain provisions requiring critical components to be acquired within the National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-3(a)(2)(i), Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Development, or Research Capability, or Expert Services to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing supplies or services in case of national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-3(b)(1)(iv)(B), use of this authority is appropriate when it is necessary to create or maintain the required domestic capability for production of critical supplies by limiting competition to items manufactured in the United States, its outlying areas, or Canada.  <br>  <br> The FMU-153 A/B Fuze is used to detonate the Projectile Gun Unit (PGU) 44/B cartridge.  The PGU 44/B cartridge is fired out of a modified howitzer on the AC-130 Gunship.  The program supports Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) training and tactical mission requirements.  The FMU-153A/B Fuze is a PD/DLY fuze that provides the user with the capability to defeat urban targets by allowing the artillery projectile to first penetrate the target before functioning.  This fuze may be set for either PD or DLY depending on the type of target.  In the PD mode, the fuze may be used against soft targets, or for registration on hard targets.  In the DLY mode, the fuze may be used against hard targets where penetration is desired.  The FMU 153/B PD/Delay fuze is a combination of two (2) proven fuze designs:  the MK399 MOD1 PD/Delay and the MK407 MOD1 PD/Delay fuzes.  The combination is the packaging of the internal components from the MK407 MOD1 into a modified hardened MK399 MOD1 fuze body.  The repackaging was direct and simple since the cavities in the fuze bodies are the same dimensions.   <br>  <br> The Technical Data Packages (TDPs) are Distribution  quote mark D quote mark , approved for release to Department of Defense (DoD) and U.S. DoD contractors.  Offerors must have facilities with sufficient safety clearance to handle hazard classifications (i.e. 1.2D).  Any request by DoD Contractors for Distribution Level  quote mark D quote mark  data shall submit the following documents:  DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement; Non-Disclosure Agreement; and, AMSTA-AR 1350.  After review of the completed forms by the Government, offerors will be notified of the Government's approval/disapproval to receive the TDP.  Completed forms should be sent via encrypted email to linda.a.schmidt12.civ@mail.mil/darryl.m.majors.civ@mail.mil.  These forms, as well as the draft RFP W15QKN-13-R-0001 and attachments are available on the Army Single Face to Industry website. <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address:  <br> Army Contracting Command - New Jersey, South Scott Plaza, Bldg 5418,  <br> Fort Dix, NJ 08640-5000  <br> Point of Contact(s):  <br> Darryl Majors, Contract Specialist, 609-562-8047/Linda Schmidt, Contracting Officer, 609-562-7357 <br>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) has a requirement for Combined Screening Team (CST) to assist the Area Support Group-Kuwait (ASG-KU) in performance of screening of non-U.S. citizens seeking employment or access to any U.S. installation within the Area Support Group-Kuwait (ASG-KU) Area of Operations (AOR). The overall goal is to identify, detect, deter, neutralize and exploit all Foreign Intelligence and Security Services (FISS) and all International Terrorism Organizations (ITO). <br>  <br> The CST tasks consist of Biometric Automated Toolset (BAT) enrollment, Locally Employed Person (LEP) screening, and Counterintelligence (CI) screening. CST will perform functions for the purpose of granting installation access badges to include enrolling all LEPs in BAT and conducting LEP screenings. CI Qualified Contractors (CIQCs) will conduct CI screening as per LEP screening interview results. Walk-in reports identified by CIQC to have CI value will be referred to ASG-KU-CI. In accordance with AR 381-20, Para 4-1, Sub Para K, CST contractors supporting CI activities will be authorized to perform CI analysis. CST contractors will maintain a local CI database of all Other Country Nationals (OCNs) screened through ASG-KU, which will be populated in the BAT data base. CIQCs will conduct CI screenings of LEPs upon occurrence of CI indicators during the screening process. CST will coordinate with the ASG-KU Direct Support CI Detachment, in order to effectively support CI operations within the scope of this PWS. CST will be equipped to travel and operate from multiple fixed sites, with the assigned Action Officer and IAW unit procedures, but will not conduct intelligence missions outside of secure areas. CST will not be armed or used to conduct source operations or Threat Awareness and Reporting Program (TARP) investigations or briefings. Regardless of any other direction the contractor shall not conduct any COVERT intelligence gathering, as the use of contractors to do so violates Army policy. The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the services herein. Such contract service providers shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn is responsible to the Government. <br>  <br> The ACC-RI intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract under solicitation W52P1J-13-R-0057 using full and open competition. The Government anticipates a base year plus four (4), one-year options. The solicitation is expected to be released on or about 15 April 2013. Potential offerors are instructed to visit the ASFI website: https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi to view the actual solicitation when it is released. Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be emailed to Mr. Kurt L. Kleinlein at kurt.l.kleinlein.civ@mail.mil or Ms. Shanna Smith at shanna.r.smith6.civ@mail.mil. <br>

<SUBJECT>Acquisition of carrier trays for operating Titertek Quadflex liquid handling system
<SOLNBR>2013-Q-15400
<RESPDATE>021613
<CONTACT>Liubov A. Kriel, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882856, Email vyh1@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Science (DLS), intends to award a sole source purchase order to Titertek Instruments, Inc., 330 Wynn Dr. NW, Suite 100, Huntsville, AL 35805-1965 for the purchase of carrier trays for operating Titertek Quadflex liquid handling system.
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase customized carrier trays for operating one-of-a-kind Titertek Quadflex liquid handling system, which produces dried blood spot materials for newborn screening quality assurance (QA). This type of liquid handling system is the only one in the world. The lab needs additional trays and equipment for the system in order to increase capacity and through-put of dried-blood spot QA materials. Titertek Instruments, Inc. is the only responsible source capable of meeting the Government's requirement because they are the only vendor who has the ability to make these customized carrier trays for the liquid handling system that is used to make close to a million spots per year. The Titertek Quadflex liquid handling system dispenses whole human blood at the lab specifications onto specialized filter paper cards. The filter paper cards are held by carrier tray that is made specifically by Titertek for the Titertek Quadflex liquid handling system. There carrier trays are customized to hold the specially sized filter paper cards and to hold these cards in place and facilitate complete drying of the applied blood spots. Each tray holds only nine cards so it takes many trays to make the thousands of dried blood spot cards that are needed each quarter. Other liquid handling systems cannot dispense whole blood for making dried blood spot QA materials to the agency's specifications. Thus, Titertek Instruments, Inc., the manufacturer of customized Titertek carrier trays for Titertek Quadflex liquid handling system, is the only company that can be used.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Titertek Instruments, Inc.. However, firms that believe they can meet these requirements are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice by providing a capability statement to the Contract Specialist by February 16, 2013. The Contract Specialist will not respond to verbal request. All requests must be in writing.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries shall be sent to Liubov Kriel by email at vyh1@cdc.gov and reference solicitation number 2013-Q-15400 on the subject line.</p>

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for an acquisition for which DLA Distribution intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for Preventive and Remedial Maintenance of firefighting vehicles, auxiliary attachments, fire hoses, and breathing air compressor located at DLA Distribution Susquehanna, New Cumberland PA.
<p>The Period of Performance for the proposed contract action will consist of a Base Year and Two (2) Option Years.</p>
<p>The firefighting vehicles to be maintained were manufactured by Kovatch Mobile Equipment (KME), and consist of a KME Response Truck and two (2) KME Pumper Trucks. Fire and Rescue Products, a division of W.W. Engine and Supply, is the only source that can provide Preventive and Remedial Maintenance for these firefighting vehicles because they are the KME factory-authorized distributor for the New Cumberland, PA area. In order to ensure that the performance, reliability and safety of these firefighting vehicles are not compromised, the contractor that performs Preventive and Remedial Maintenance must be a factory authorized distributor that employs factory trained service technicians who are technically familiar with the KME firefighting vehicles, and have unlimited access to obtain OEM replacement parts. KME has established this authorized distributor network to ensure replacement part compatibility and repair service integrity because the use of non-OEM replacement parts and non-OEM factory trained service technicians could be catastrophic in terms of equipment liability costs and personnel injury or death. Accordingly, the Government intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price/time-and-materials purchase order utilizing FAR Parts 12 and 13 to Fire and Rescue Products to provide Preventive and Remedial Maintenance of firefighting vehicles, auxiliary attachments, fire hoses, and breathing air compressor.</p>
<p>Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Only one (1) contract award will be made for this requirement. Contractors must have the capability to provide maintenance for all of the firefighting equipment listed above.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 811219 with a small business size standard of $19,000,000.00.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may respond by submitting qualifications/capabilities of the company to provide Preventive and Remedial Maintenance of firefighting vehicles, auxiliary attachments, fire hoses, and breathing air compressor by 4:00 PM Eastern time, APRIL 5, 2013 to DLA Distribution, Acquisition Operations, J7-AB, J Avenue, Bldg 404, New Cumberland, PA 17070, Attn: Daniel Herring, Phone: 717-770-6030, FAX: 717-770-5689, e-mail: daniel.herring@dla.mil, or Christopher Rowe, Phone: 717-770-7133, FAX: 717-770-5689, e-mail: christopher.rowe@dla.mil for consideration by the agency. If no affirmative responses are received by 4:00 PM Eastern time, APRIL 5, 2013 to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, a purchase order will be negotiated with and awarded to Fire and Rescue Products.</p>

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.<br /> <br />The Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is re-competing a full and open contract for support services for feasibility projects, pilot studies, methodologic research, specialized tasks in large scale studies, full scale support for cross-sectional, cohort and case-control studies.<br /><br />A major objective of DCEG is to identify and understand mechanisms of carcinogenesis.  Studies within HREB importantly focus on sex differences in cancer etiology and address risk factors for some of the most prevalent gender-specific cancers of men (prostate, testis) and women (breast, endometrium, ovarian, cervix).  In addition, efforts are placed on clarifying the etiology of a number of rare cancers (e.g., liver cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, male breast cancer).<br /><br />To achieve its goals, HREB's approach has been to (1) integrate risk factor information with many different biologic markers into interdisciplinary molecular epidemiologic investigations to understand a variety of exposures as related to multiple cancers and gain insights into mechanisms that mediate risk factors; (2) to sub-divide tumors into etiologically and prognostically distinct entities; (3) examine natural history of and progression for cancer precursors; (4) address rapidly emerging issues in cancer epidemiology through novel investigations of poorly understood risk factors and under-studied hormonal and reproductive cancers; and (5) assist in training the next generation of hormonal, reproductive, and molecular epidemiologists.<br /><br />The philosophical focus of HREB research is to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that relate carefully defined exposure assessments to specific outcomes to provide new insights into cancer etiology, hormonal carcinogenesis, and mechanisms of action.  Molecular approaches play a critical and increasingly important role in HREB research. Approximately thirteen studies will likely receive support under the contract.<br /><br />This support services contract is essential for HREB to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate risk factor information with many different biologic markers to provide new insights into cancer etiology and mechanisms of action. The NCI/HREB requires the assistance of an organization highly experienced in providing technical support for all phases of epidemiologic studies, including support for pilot and feasibility efforts to assess capabilities for launching multidisciplinary studies, development of precise methods of defining exposures to identify new causes of cancer and to adequately characterize the shape of the exposure-response relationship, and to understand the interaction of genetic and environmental factors related to cancer risk. Thus, the support services contract will need to provide staff with superb logistical skills, knowledge of epidemiological studies and diverse biological specimens, and appreciation of specimen collection and handling requirements in order to enable technologically sophisticated assay development and performance. The contract will establish a mechanism to provide all the services required to conduct a wide variety of domestic and international (case-control, cohort, cross-sectional, and pilot) studies.<br /><br />The scientific design and oversight of the activities are the responsibility of the HREB professional staff.<br /><br />This work is currently being conducted under contract HHSN261200800029C held by Westat, Inc.<br /><br />The services will be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541990. It is anticipated that one contract may be awarded beginning on or about September 1, 2013.<br /><br />The RFP will be available electronically at a later date and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile or email transmissions will be accepted. IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE MENTIONED SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command / NAS Patuxent River, MD intends to issue a sole source award to Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control (LMMFC), Dallas, TX, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c )(1) and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i). The requirement is for the contractor to provide target material TOPSCENE database production and maintenance and pre-planned TOPSCENE software product improvements for Mission Rehearsal Scene Visualization for Naval Aviation and life cycle support of TOPSCENE legacy software products as well as to support contingency operations through target identification if requested. Tactical Operational Scene (TOPSCENE) is the Navy's program of record for Mission Rehearsal Scene Visualization for Naval Aviation. The key TOPSCENE objectives are to provide software products and support of the fielded mission rehearsal systems as standalone software applications or as integrated software within the Naval Aviation Mission Planning Environment. LMMFC will be required to produce software products that support geo-specific scene visualization, weapon and sensor specific simulation, and interoperability with legacy mission planning systems and software, e.g. Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS), and Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS). Since the inception of the TOPSCENE Program at Milestone B, 4th quarter FY1990, LMMFC has been the sole designer, developer and producer of the TOPSCENE/TTVS application.
<p>LMMFC is the only source with the requisite knowledge and experience to complete the development, integration and production of the TOPSCENE/TTVS software products to meet the Navy's requirements. The Navy does not have a complete technical data and computer software package, nor sufficient license rights in the technical data and computer software delivered necessary to conduct a competition. Therefore, LMMFC is the sole source capable of providing the support and producing the software products required. See numbered note 22.</p>

<DESC>The United States Government, represented by The Agency for International Development (USAID/Caucasus Georgia) through the Regional Contracting Office intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about April 5, 2013. It is anticipated to be a multi-year Cost Plus Fixed-Fee Contract to implement The Restoring Efficiency to Agriculture Production activity (REAP) in Georgia.
<p><br />The objective of REAP is to increase employment and incomes in rural areas. This will be achieved by providing assistance to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in order to support improved agricultural productivity, marketing, and processing. REAP will expand the number, quality, competitiveness, and profitability of agribusinesses serving small-holder and emerging commercial farmers in Georgia by providing demand-driven TA and grants to qualified enterprises.</p>
<p>Facilitating the entry of new agribusinesses to the Georgian market and expanding the operations of existing enterprises will create new jobs in the agriculture sector, improve the availability of high-quality inputs and machinery services for farmers, and strengthen markets for agricultural goods and services in the country.</p>
<p>Sub-awards, including grants, will be utilized to facilitate the achievement of activity objectives, with a particular focus on working through Georgian institutions and ensuring sustainability. The Contractor will use clear, simple, and transparent procedures for all sub-awards. REAP will provide a mechanism for "grants-under-contract" consistent with ADS 302.3.4.8, all other relevant regulations, and guidance from USAID's Office of Acquisition and Assistance (OAA). At the direction of USAID/Caucasus, up to 5% of contract resources may be reprogrammed to assist primary producers in response to natural or man-made disasters occurring over the life of the contract.</p>
<p>More specifically, REAP will make grants and technical assistance (TA) available to existing and newly-formed (start-up) private enterprises in the agriculture sector, including input suppliers, machinery service providers, storage facilities, sorting/grading centers, and small- and medium-scale processors. Grants and TA may also be provided to primary production businesses, cooperatives, or associations. Grant applicants meeting certain criteria will be provided with TA to develop viable business plans, and selected applicants will receive matching grants and additional TA to implement their business plans. The Contractor will also provide additional TA to farmers and non-grantee SMEs to improve technical and business skills and facilitate improved linkages between input suppliers, farmers, value-adding enterprises, and end markets (both domestic and international).</p>
<p>Through these activities, it is expected that the Contractor will achieve the following objectives:</p>
<p>&bull; Sustainably increase the availability and utilization of agricultural inputs, services, and technical information among small-holder and emerging commercial farmers;<br />&bull; Improve the business operations, quality, and profitability of beneficiary agribusinesses;<br />&bull; Increase skills, yields, and incomes of farmers linked to assisted businesses;<br />&bull; Increase employment opportunities in rural areas.</p>
<p>Except for the above, no additional information regarding this planned RFP is available at this time. All necessary information will be supplied at the time the RFP is posted at www.fbo.gov . Questions/requests for information will not be responded to until RFP issuance. Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement. No proposals for funding should be submitted until after the RFP is issued.</p>
<p>Prospective Offerors are advised that this procurement is subject to internal USAID approvals and the availability of funds. This pre-solicitation notice in no way obligates USAID to release a solicitation or award a contract. This notice satisfies the synopsis requirement in FAR 5.201.</p>

<DESC>309th Electronic Maintenance Group<br />Sources Sought Synopsis
<p><br />Notice: This is not a solicitation but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541330.</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes a sources sought synopsis for purposes of conducting market research.

<p>The Air Force is in the process of preparing documentation to gain the required approval to issue a sole source Justification &amp; Approval (J&amp;A) for proposal to BAE which has supported the Air Force in this capacity for the past several years. Statutory authority is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (C) (1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.

The Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC) and the 523rd Avionics Squadron is designated as the source of on-call technical support and repairs services for all ADICTS.</p>
<p>Subject to the Government's consideration, a viable source, not already qualified to provide the requisite services should submit a concise and service specific response presenting sufficient information to substantiate that: (1) they possess the necessary skills and resources to provide maintenance for the ADICTS; and (2) they possess the OEM proprietary data (including software source code) and drawings used to provide on-call technical support and repairs services for the ADICTS.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Air Force will not pay for either the effort or the associated costs to respond, or for any information provided. The information provided is considered market research and may be utilized by the AF in developing its acquisition strategy Statement of Objectives, and Performance Specifications. Any proprietary information that is submitted may be used as a general concept but specific information will be safeguarded as proprietary, if so marked.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to information received will be normally considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Responses must be submitted by 11:00 am MDT on April 04, 2013 to the individual who this posting identifies as the buyer (Ms. Brook Manning). This buyer is the primary point of contact for this sources sought synopsis, and the Procuring Contracting Officer/PCO (as identified in this posting) is the alternate point of contact. Email responses may be submitted in PDF or Microsoft Word Format. Questions will be accepted electronically directly from the buyer. The Government will post responses to industry questions within the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND. The Department of State (DOS) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is the Bureau charged with foreign policy development relating to international crime, drug trafficking, corruption, criminal justice reform, post-conflict/civilian policing, and related issues. In Macedonia, and throughout the Balkans, INL supports criminal justice sector reforms and facilitates effective cross-border and regional law enforcement cooperation. In each country in the region, INL provides training, technical, and material support to police, prosecutors, and judges. INL has a wide array of partners in this effort, including other U.S. agencies, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and commercial providers.</p>
<p>Macedonia is an active recipient of Assistance to Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia (AEECA) funding from DOS Office of the Coordinator of U.S. Assistance to Europe and Eurasia (EUR/ACE). AEECA funding provides bilateral economic, security, democracy, and humanitarian assistance to 18 states of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Embassy Skopje receives approximately $2.5M annually in AEECA funding for this effort, as well as for the following programs: a law enforcement capacity program, implemented by the Department of Justice's Office of International Criminal Investigative Training and Assistance Program (ICITAP); and a defense bar program, implemented by the American Bar Association; and a legal socialization civil society program. Macedonia, like every other candidate state for the European Union (EU), must demonstrate its capacity to fight organized crime and corruption and bolster public confidence in its justice sector institutions. INL's capacity-building programs are critical for achieving these goals.</p>
<p>After the formal adoption of the new Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) by the Macedonian Parliament on November 17, 2010, Macedonia began a substantial transformation of its criminal justice system from one that is inquisitorial to one that is more adversarial and closer to the U.S. system. The transformation entails dramatically changing the roles and responsibilities of the police, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges in Macedonia. The centerpiece of this new legislative framework is the adoption of a new CPC, which introduces new concepts into the criminal justice system: prosecutor-led investigations, greater defense rights and responsibilities to gather and challenge evidence, multiple special investigative techniques, direct and cross examination of witnesses, and trials in which the judge presides, rather than investigates.</p>
<p>INL programs in Macedonia focus on effective, efficient and transparent implementation of the CPC that will streamline investigations and prosecutions enhance interagency cooperation, and more effectively address organized crime, corruption, and political interference within Macedonian justice sector institutions. Implementation of this framework will promote greater accountability among justice sector institutions and actors, requiring extensive public outreach and significant monitoring and advocacy on the part of civil society and the media.</p>
<p>B. PURPOSE. The purpose of this position is to provide a Senior Justice Advisor (SJA) to U.S. Embassy Skopje who will serve as the central role in developing INL programs to support Macedonia's judicial reforms and other rule-of-law initiatives that will help further Macedonia's progress toward EU and NATO membership. This program will be focused on implementation of the CPC, but the advisor will be expected to formulate innovative, targeted, and sustainable approaches for building the rule of law in Macedonia.</p>
<p>The Advisor is responsible for in-country management of INL justice reform programs and ensuring that these programs are meeting expectations. The Advisor coordinates activities with the Deputy Chief of Mission, the rule of law political officer in country, and the INL Office of Europe and Asia (INL/EA) Program Officer in Washington, DC. INL seeks applicants with the requisite technical expertise, and a strong management background who are able to operate independently and work with limited resources.</p>
<p>C. STATEMENT OF WORK<br />Primary Duties and Responsibilities<br />a. Serve as the SJA within INL/EA's overall assistance mission in Macedonia.</p>
<p>b. Provide policy analysis and program guidance to INL, Embassy Skopje, and other USG entities on effective mechanisms for, progress in, and impediments to, achieving reform objectives in Macedonia.</p>
<p>c. Manage, coordinate, and supervise all phases of INL justice programs in Macedonia, including sustainment upon completion of projects and supervision of two local staff. The incumbent should be able to work independently to ensure that the program and administrative budgets are monitored routinely and that the projects fall within program guidelines notified to Congress and OMB.</p>
<p>d. Ensure compliance with INL program management policies and procedures, which will include negotiating INL bilateral Letters of Agreement; monitoring procurement and end use monitoring policies; and drafting program planning documents, such as work plans and monitoring and evaluation frameworks.</p>
<p>e. Establish and maintain relationships with Macedonian justice sector and other government officials, including prosecutors, investigators, judges, defense attorneys, civil society, parliamentarians, and other rule of law actors. Ensure adequate follow up with study groups and training (train-the-trainer, alumni conferences).</p>
<p>f. Design and monitor assistance programs for the justice sector utilizing a range of methodologies such as conducting interviews and focus groups as well as reviewing analytical reports. Ensure program activities develop local capacity. Activities should include a broad range of justice sector actors and there should be a strong emphasis on joint/collective training between different criminal justice groups (i.e. police- prosecutor workshops). Assist Macedonia in attaining EU accession goals by meeting EU benchmarks related to judicial reform and fair trials by hosting local workshops and practical case studies.</p>
<p>g. Coordinate with other implementers in the international donor community, including the European Commission, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and other donors. Maintain close collaboration with ICITAP, ABA, the Public Affairs Section and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).</p>
<p>h. Serve as a trainer for INL funded training programs. Provide mentoring and technical assistance to prosecutors on a range of issues such as plea bargaining and prosecutor-led investigations. Identify outside experts, when appropriate, to serve as trainers.</p>
<p>i. Focus on establishing guidelines, standard operating procedures, and public diplomacy tools build alumni networks and develop mechanisms for linking Macedonian criminal justice actors with U.S. and European criminal justice professionals.</p>
<p>j. Provide mentoring on key justice concepts to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the justice system, including prosecutor-led investigations, plea-bargaining, and expanded use of special investigative techniques.</p>
<p>k. Advise Embassy Front Office and INL/EA on legislative developments impacting the criminal justice sector. Assess the impact of political developments on U.S. policy objectives and make recommendations to the Country Team. Develop legal memoranda and technical support on legal issues that may arise in connection with policy or program issues.</p>
<p>l. Prepare after-action reports for all discrete assistance activities conducted in accordance with the work plan with the Embassy Country Team.</p>
<p>D. POSITION ELEMENTS<br />1. Supervision Received:<br />The Advisor will receive guidance from the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) and will receive program policy guidance concerning the overall program priorities and objectives from the INL/EA Program Officer. The Advisor is also expected to coordinate closely with the rule of law political officer in Embassy Skopje.</p>
<p>2. Supervision Exercised: <br />The Advisor will supervise all staff implementing INL's justice program in Macedonia.</p>
<p>3. Guidelines:<br />The Advisor will be guided by the INL Program and Policy Guide. Supplementary guidance will be provided by the Foreign Affairs Manuals for Financial Management (4 FAM), General Services (6 FAM) and Logistics Management (14 FAM), and associated Foreign Affairs Handbooks (FAH).</p>
<p>4. Complexity:<br />The work involves planning, organizing, and managing day-to-day administration and oversight of a large number of organizational initiatives and training details. The ability to effectively manage large quantities of ever evolving data is essential.</p>
<p>5. Scope and Effectiveness: <br />The Advisor performs a broad range of tasks related to a complex foreign assistance program in the Republic of Macedonia. INL programs have a significant impact on embassy operations, including those of other USG agencies.</p>
<p>6. Personal Contacts: <br />The Advisor will work closely with the senior ICITAP advisor, the American Bar Association project lead, the INL legal socialization program, Embassy Management Section personnel, USG law enforcement agencies, contractors implementing INL projects, and host country counterparts.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">REQUEST FOR INFORMATION for:<br />Ongoing Physical Security, Technical Security Infrastructure &amp; Security Administrative Support.<br />AG-3143-S-13-0019</p>
<p>I. Introduction: <br />The responses to this Request for Information (RFI) from interested, capable, small business firms will assist the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in making a set aside decision, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19.5.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of USDA. The Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Coordination (OHSEC) intends to compete its 8(a) follow-on requirement for ongoing physical security, technical security infrastructure, and security administrative support. USDA is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced and interested 8(a) potential sources that possess a Top Secret facility clearance. USDA intends to issue a competitive 8(a) solicitation for these requirements. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be incurred by interested parties in responding to this sources sought announcement.</p>
<p>USDA is seeking interested 8(a) sources (contractors) for a near-term solicitation and procurement for a continuing requirement for physical security, technical security infrastructure, and security administrative services in support of its Homeland Security programs. At this time, no solicitation exists. Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION. This nationwide effort will include support throughout the continental United States, Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico. The following NAICS codes are considered as applicable to this scope of work:</p>
<p>a. 541512: Computer Systems Design Services (This is the NAICS code used&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the original contract);<br />b. 541611: Administrative Management &amp; General Management;<br />c. 561621: Security Systems Services;<br />d. 928110: National Security.</p>
<p><br />II. Background: <br />OHSEC's Physical Security Division (PSD) is responsible for assisting USDA Agencies with risk mitigation plans to protect their facilities, personnel and assets outside of the National Capital Region. In order to execute necessary efforts, a contractor is needed to assist USDA in implementing its requirements in a timely and coordinated manner, and in fulfilling strategic directives and methodologies as approved by senior management. The capabilities require security support services inclusive of program management and contractor technical and administrative assistance to ensure completeness of USDA's assigned security missions. Managed by PSD, this contract will provide security services and related technical security support and counter-terrorism security activities in a wide range of areas for OHSEC and various USDA agencies.</p>
<p>Note : Procurements for security services and security products involving facilities or security system access control must be in accordance with HSPD-12 policy and the Federal Acquisition Regulation. In order to ensure government-wide interoperability, OMB Memorandum 06-18, "Acquisition of Products and Services for Implementation of HSPD-12" requires agencies to acquire products and services that are approved as compliant with Federal policy, standards and supporting technical specifications.</p>
<p>Note: Current internal USDA policy dictates that individual task orders for specific IT activities and/or services may require an IT Waiver document to be prepared and approved by the Office of Chief Information Officer (OCIO) for orders over $25k. This is the responsibility of the USDA Task Manager to develop.</p>
<p>III.

This acquisition will require access to information classified as "Sensitive but Unclassified" or "For Official Use Only".<br><br>BACKGROUND:<br>The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.  It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range.  Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification.<br><br>INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT:<br>1.  Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST, apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon, and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range.<br>     a.  System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics.<br>     b.  Pseudo real-time Line Of Sight (LOS) correlation to the projection screen.<br>     c.  Pseudo real-time Point of Aim (POA)/Point of Impact (POI) for all rounds fired.<br>     d.  High fidelity After Action Review (AAR) at student and Instructor Operator Station (IOS).<br>     e.  High fidelity weapon interface for Form, Fit and Function with Magazine loading.<br>     f.  All U.S. Army standard Courses of Fire (COF) with results feedback on doctrine scorecard.<br>     g.  Provides pre and post aim point trace for individual weapons.<br>     h.  Provides burst by burst trace for machine gun weapons.<br><br>2.  Ability to provide training events that support realistic physics-based modeling for environments and models with variable outcomes.<br><br>3.  Sufficient intellectual property rights in the interface protocols for the Government to allow a third-party contractor to maintain and repair the system and its weapons.<br><br>4.  Ability to support High Definition Television (HDTV) format interactive video training events for judgmental use of force SDS training.<br><br>5.  Provide ongoing ability to integrate the Army POR for gaming (currently Virtual Battlespace 2 (VBS 2) into the system.<br><br>HANDS ON INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITY:<br>Respondents are invited to use the EST located at PEO STRI, Orlando, for a period of up to 2 business days from 23 January 2012 - 24 February 2012.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:
INTRODUCTION:

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
In an effort to reduce energy usage and the overall operating cost at the Sheridan VAMC a chilled water loop is being constructed. This project includes the construction of a portion of this loop. 
Another energy and operating cost reducing effort in this project is the construction of a Variable Air Volume cooling and heating system for the Library and Computer learning center. This project will use an existing air handler, and will provide new ductwork, variable air volume units with reheat coils, and exhaust air. This air handling system will be computer controlled, and will have night setback and airside economizer features. Therefore this system will conserve energy in comparison to the existing through the wall units. 
The final portion of this project will be the addition of a tank-less steam to water heater in the homeless shelter. Currently the building domestic hot water is coming from a tank type water heater with a large quantity of storage located in another building. Energy will be saved in a reduction of heat loss in the distribution system from one building to the other, and will not have a storage tank continually requiring water to be heated. 
PROCUREMENT INFORMATION:

<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) and Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>

<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 4, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Air Resources Laboratory (ARL), Atmospheric Turbulence and Diffusion Division (ATDD), Oak Ridge, TN, proposes to enter into a contract with Wood International, Inc. on a basis other than full and open competition.  ATDD requires consulting services to provide systems administration and scientific programmatic support services for programmatic and infrastructure needs for a transition period of April 1, 2013 - May 31, 2013.
<p>The extensive expertise and experience of Wood International, Inc. with the needs of ATDD and its programs, both internal and external, cannot be duplicated without excessive programmatic expense and excessive start up time by any another other source.  Their experience and outstanding track record with ATDD, its programs, and its unique set of data collection and processing requirements simply cannot be duplicated with as few contractor personnel at as low a cost while maintaining critical continuity of operations both with in-house computing needs as well as programmatic requirements.</p>
<p>An increasingly critical issue for all Government computer systems is IT security, and the requirements for computer security.  The measures, mandated by various federal statutes and internal NOAA processes itself require a great deal of understanding of the entire ATDD network and each device attached to it, as well as an understanding of the scientific requirements and technical details surrounding their implementation.  ATDD's network has largely been engineered, installed, and maintained by Wood International over many years.  Wood International has successfully employed countermeasures against countless attacks on ATDD's systems throughout their tenure here at ATDD.  ATDD has not experienced a computer security problem that involved an outside attacker for many years, although thousands of attempts have been made.  It would take considerable and time-consuming effort by a different contractor to gain the needed familiarity with the complexities surrounding the configuration and management of this network, especially considering the many complex custom-built hardware and software systems.  Many of these systems were in fact designed and created by Wood International in collaboration with ATDD scientists and engineers.</p>
<p>In addition to the practical application of successful defenses against computer security attacks, there has been an enormous increase in the required documentation concerning computer and network security.  The certification and accreditation (C&amp;A) process that is required to permit a federal facility to operate computers has become more complex and technical each year.   This is driven by ever changing requirements with FISMA, Department of Commerce, and NOAA.  Wood International has performed the work for every C&amp;A process undergone by ATDD.  This process requires documentation concerning every aspect of ATDD's network and each computer on this network: hardware and software inventories, patch management, network topology (including the connections with outside agencies such as DOE), security specifics including policies and procedures, quarterly security sweeps, user training, certification of minimum security standards, testing plans, etc.  This documentation requires a deep understanding of the existing network as well as of the various mandates from NIST, DOC, and NOAA that comprise the C&amp;A requirements.  Wood International is the only company qualified to perform this work for ATDD.  No one else understands the network as a whole well enough to proceed with this process; it would take months for another contractor to gain the requisite knowledge to complete the mandated tasks.</p>
<p>For ATDD's scientific missions, Wood International has worked with scientific and engineering staff to develop unique software, databases, and data collection and processing methodologies whose loss would be highly damaging to existing ATDD programs and prohibitively expensive (if possible at all) to replace.  For example, NOAA's national U.S. Climate Reference Network (CRN) equipment database, developed by Wood International, contains an inventory of all CRN-related equipment and associated NIST-traceable calibration records that is critical to the long-term success of the long-term (50 to 100 years) data collection efforts of the CRN program.  Another critical system for ATDD is the Regional Air Modeling and Analytical Network (RAMAN).  RAMAN is a system of seventeen remotely located observing stations scattered across East Tennessee that collect meteorological data and ozone concentrations.  This system incorporates a database and website developed by Wood International that provides secure and quick access to this data in a variety of formats, including graphs and various data file formats, for ATDD and for our regional RAMAN partners.  NOAA's Surface Energy Budget Network (SEBN) at ATDD has similar data collection and dissemination system developed by Wood International, including specialized data network links to overcome challenging networking issues at some of the very remote, autonomous SEBN sites.  In the area of homeland security, DCNet/URBANet is a Congressionally mandated NOAA/ARL program designed to test and evaluate the feasibility of acquiring useful wind turbulence measurements within the complex topology of the urban environment, with particular emphasis on the Washington DC downtown area.  Wood International developed the database and website for this crucial program, which is used by a variety of government agencies dealing with homeland security issues.  Wood International has also developed the security infrastructure for Threatmap, an ARL homeland security-related system providing critical information to various homeland security planners and emergency response agencies.  Wood International has participated in the development and implementation of aircraft-based computer-driven data collection systems for both NOAA and its collaborative partners' research aircraft, including the joint University of Tennessee Space Institute (UTSI) and Harvard University efforts between ATDD and UTSI and Harvard University.</p>
<p>In the last several years, a host of new software packages have been introduced across NOAA by the Department of Commerce and NOAA for critical management purposes.  These include software for procurement, inventory, budgeting, travel, and time and attendance monitoring.  These packages have usually been provided with minimal training and have often not run well from ATDD's remote location.  Wood International has provided troubleshooting capabilities that were simply unavailable within NOAA, enabling the new systems to operate properly.  In this instance, the key factors were extensively detailed knowledge of the peculiarities of the ATDD network and connection to the Internet, as well as a broad range of experience in making software work.</p>
<p>In short, the expertise and unique knowledge of Wood International of all facets of computing at ATDD, from aircraft-based onboard data collection and processing systems, to remote sensing applications, geographic information systems, and secure wireless networking applications, to the in-house administrative systems necessary for day-to-day operation of the laboratory, and to their expertise in research, development, network design, implementation, DOC network security requirements and software, and network administration simply does not exist with any other source.  Wood International currently is under contract and is responsible for the vast majority of the existing core computing infrastructure at ATDD and has maintained it for several years.  No other source has the experience and knowledge to perform this function at the required level of competence and skill without an extended learning period.</p>
<p>The extensive expertise and experience supplied by Wood International, Inc., coupled with the software and databases developed by Wood International, Inc., and used extensively throughout ATDD, coupled with their unique understanding of the programs and business practices of ATDD, limits other organizations from assuming a similar role with ATDD.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br /></span>NO SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS SYNOPSIS AS THIS WORK IS NOW COMPLETED.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this Modification 4 is to deobligate $44,293.172 in ARRA funding from the task order as these funds are not anticipated to be needed at this time and all work is complete. <strong>The task order had a period of performance of September 20, 2011 through December 31, 2012.</strong> The objectives of this task order have been previously posing in www.fbo.gov. These objectives were to provide support in 1) evaluating the National Clean Diesel Campaign's (NCDC) American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) grants, 2) identifying and analyzing the actual emissions attributable to ARRA-funded projects, and 3) analyzing the environmental results and benefits of different types of ARRA projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The total dollar value of the support provided for this task for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) projects was $179,929.83.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

There is no charge for using FedConnect?. The pre-solicitation notice for this requirement will continue to be sent to FedBizOpps (FBO) and will also be made available on FedConnect?.  However, the solicitation will be made available on the FedConnect? portal only and will not be posted on CPOD's internet site. CPOD will communicate with potential offerors via FedConnect? on matters related to the solicitation actions for this requirement. Potential offerors can register with FedConnect? at www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/.  Please note that FedConnect? is used by multiple federal agencies and therefore assistance with FedConnect? will be provided by Compusearch Software Systems, not the EPA.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI).  This RFI working group announcement supports general program planning related to evolving the PM TRADE standards portfolio in a collaborative working group environment.  This RFI will not result in a contract action related to interface standards development.   This working group is strictly voluntary.   <br>  <br> PM TRADE is seeking industry participation, support, and feedback on identifying, maturing, and instantiating key Live Training interface standards. This is an opportunity for industry to provide knowledge, insight, and recommendations in shaping the logical partitions and in developing key Live Training interface standards with the government.  Adhering to these key interface standards will be a requirement in future programs. <br>  <br> Interdependencies across the PM TRADE product line portfolio are becoming more prevalent and necessitate that non-proprietary PM TRADE wide interface standards must be established and actively managed to ensure continuity in development and sustainment.  Through vendor-neutral interface standards, PM TRADE's intent is to reduce the total cost of ownership, improve interoperability, and implement an architecture that supports technology and component insertion.   Upon publishing, these PM TRADE non-proprietary interfaces and associated software will be configuration managed under the LT2 construct.  Refer to the attachment for additional information. This specific initiative does not impact and is separate from the FASIT interface standards. <br>  <br> On 2 April 2013 PM TRADE will host an Industry Day to initiate key Live Training interface standards development. See the attachment for details. Each company is requested to RSVP via email to Rob.Wolf1@us.army.mil by COB on 27 March 2013 with the information listed below.  Questions related to this working group shall be submitted in writing and addressed to Rob.Wolf1@us.army.mil and christie.p.martinez@us.army.mil

<p>B. The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists, no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price. In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) and 15.403-3(a), data other than cost or pricing data may be required to support price reasonableness and realism. Data shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.403-5. If, after receipt of proposals, the CO determines that there is insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1 apply, the Offeror shall be required to submit certified cost or pricing data. Should adequate price competition not exist after receipt of proposals, the provisions of FAR Part 15.403-4 shall apply, and the Offeror will be asked to provide certification of cost or pricing data?</p>
<p>C. Specific Instructions:</p>
<p>1. Volume I - PRICE PROPOSAL</p>
<p>(a) Insert proposed prices on the bid schedule (Attachment 2) for the base period, the one (1) option period, and a combined total price of the base period and option period .

<p>&nbsp;52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items - Addendum</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS</p>
<p>I. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD</p>
<p>A. This is a competitive Best Value acquisition using the Tradeoff Process, without technical proposals, with Past Performance being approximately equal to Price. This procurement will be conducted as a Total Small Business Set-Aside for small business concerns eligible under the small business program. The Government will award a contract resulting from the solicitation to the acceptable, responsible Small Business offeror whose proposal conforming to this solicitation offers the Best Value to the Government, with Past Performance being approximately equal to Price. Evaluation criteria are the same for all competing offerors.</p>
<p>B. Offerors shall propose on all items. Any offer that fails to cite a price for each item or fails to make an entry that indicates service will be provided at no charge may be rejected as nonconforming to this solicitation.</p>
<p>C. Only Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) offers will be evaluated. An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.</p>
<p>D. The evaluation process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1. Price: Initially, offers will be ranked according to Total Evaluated Price (TEP). The price evaluation will be made on the basis of the total price of all line items including the corresponding CLINs under Options. An offeror must therefore propose on all line items including the options. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness based on prices submitted from competitive proposals, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate. Prices will also be evaluated to determine if they are materially unbalanced. Materially unbalanced prices risk rejection.</p>
<p>2. Past Performance: Using the information provided in the Past Performance Reference Information (Volume II), Past Performance Proposal and other available information, the contracting officer shall seek recent and relevant performance information on all offerors based on the past efforts provided by the offeror and data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources.<br /><br />(a) Recent and Relevant Information: For the purpose of this combined synopsis/solicitation, Recent and Relevant Past Performance is defined as:</p>
<p>(1) Recent - Ongoing contracts with a performance history and contracts completed within three (3) years from the issue date of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) Relevant - Performance of work efforts involving Oil/Water, Grease Traps and Lift Stations services and management that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation and performance work statement.</p>
<p>(b) The Government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFP, based on the offeror's demonstrated past performance. The Government will conduct a performance confidence assessment based upon past performance of the offerors as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements. This evaluation will include the contractor's record of: (A) conforming to the Performance Work Statement and contract requirements, (B) management of work, (C) reasonable, cooperative behavior, performance and commitment to customer satisfaction and (D) quality control. This assessment represents the government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort, based upon the offeror's demonstrated past performance. The rating may be determined initially or as a result of discussions. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence.</p>
<p>(c) Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Definitions for Performance Confidence Assessments and Relevancy are as defined below:</p>
<p>Performance Confidence Assessments</p>
<p>Substantial Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, The Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Limited Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, The Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>No Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, The Government has no expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Unknown Confidence (Neutral) - No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>Past Performance Relevancy Ratings Definitions</p>
<p>Very Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br /><br />Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>(d) In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFP.</p>
<p>E. Best Value Determination: Offerors will be initially ranked from lowest Total Evaluated Price (TEP) to the highest TEP.</p>
<p>1. If the lowest TEP is determined to be reasonable, and is judged to have an overall Substantial confidence performance rating, that offer represents the Best Value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>2. IF THE LOWEST TEP OFFER IS NOT JUDGED TO HAVE AN OVERALL SUBSTAINIAL CONFIDENCE PEFORMANCE RATING THE EVALUATION WILL CONTINUE AS FOLLOWS:</p>
<p>(a) If the lowest TEP acceptable offer is reasonable, but does not have a confidence rating of Substantial Confidence, the next lowest TEP, acceptable offer will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror whose price is reasonable receives a confidence rating of Substantial Confidence overall for past performance.</p>
<p>(b) The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment Best Value award decision by determining if the Best Value to the Government is to pay a higher cost for a higher past performance assessment rating. The Government reserves the following rights:</p>
<p>(1) To award a contract to the lowest TEP offeror who has Substantial Confidence Rating;<br />(2) To award to higher TEP offeror who has Substantial Confidence Rating;<br />(3) To award a contract to the lowest TEP offeror who has at least a Satisfactory Confidence Rating.</p>
<p>3. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in FAR 52.212-1. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of present and past performance information) or respond to adverse present/past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>4. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>
<p>5. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers: The Government may reject any proposal that is assessed to be unrealistic in terms of contract requirements, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect lack of competence or failure to comprehend the scope of the requirement. Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of price may be rejected at any time during the evaluation process. Proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions with the offerors (other than minor clarification[s]), unless discussions are determined to be necessary. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. Offerors may be required to participate in telephone discussions or in face-to-face oral discussions at the Operational Contracting Division, 308 West "D" Avenue, Suite 130, Bldg 260, Eglin AFB FL. Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers received, without discussion of such offers. The offeror's initial proposal should reflect their best effort.</p>

<DESC>Post of duty is: 99 New York Avenue, NE, Washington, DC 20226.
<p>YOU MUST BE ABLE TO COMMUTE DAILY TO THE PERSONNEL SECURITY BRANCH OFFICE IN WASHINGTON, DC</p>
<p>Description<br />The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) has an established Contract Background Investigation Program (CBIP) to conduct personnel security background investigations on prospective ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as periodic reinvestigations on all current employees. The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information. Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450, 12968, and 13467, the Privacy Act of 1974, Office of Personnel Management regulations, other relevant regulations from the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures.</p>
<p>ATF's CBIP utilizes the services of experienced investigators to conduct investigative leads. However, ATF realizes there is a need to secure the services of persons possessing certain degrees of expertise in the processing of background investigations, including planning, scoping, assigning and reviewing. To that end, ATF has determined that the most efficient and cost-effective method of conducting such activities is to employ the services of contract investigators and therefore, has a need for "In-House Special Investigators," hereinafter referred to as contractors.</p>
<p>Operational and administration aspects of the program are contracted out to trained and experienced investigators or personnel security professionals, typically, though not exclusively, retired federal investigators who have at least 3 years of current experience in the administration of and/or conduct of personnel security background investigations. Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by ATF.</p>
<p>Contract investigators who are under contract with ATF shall be known as "Special Investigators" and carry credentials authorizing them to perform such background investigations as the Assistant Director may authorize. Contractors may also be assigned to assist with other official ATF investigations.</p>
<p>The Office of Professional Responsibilities and Security Operations, Personnel Security Branch (PSB), shall monitor the conduct of all background investigators. The Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) and the contractor's responsibilities thereunder are subject to changes in Federal law, regulation and policy, which may include, but are not limited to procedural changes related to the use of government equipment, security procedures, and investigative priorities. All modifications may be sent to contractors via mail or electronic mail after review and approval of ATF Contracting Officer and Program Office.</p>
<p>Program Requirements<br />The PSB is currently organized into four (4) team sections. Applicant Team: responsible for conducting background investigations on potential ATF special agents, industry operations investigators, and other ATF personnel. Contactor Team: responsible for conducting background investigations on potential ATF contractors, task force officers, student interns, and volunteers. Employee Team: responsible for conducting periodic reinvestigations on current ATF employees. Investigations Team: responsible for organizing assignments, review and approval of background investigative leads sent to ATF Field Special Investigators. In addition, the Investigations Team provides guidance to Special Investigators in the field; they also serve as the authority for investigative coverage requirements.</p>
<p>Contractors must possess sufficient investigative, administrative and managerial abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them. Such tasks might include planning assignments, scoping investigations, assigning investigations, reviewing Reports of Investigation (ROI), auditing and adjudicating investigations, completing requests for payment and working on special projects as directed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), Branch Chief or designee. Contractors must be computer literate and efficient in software programs that support email, word processing, and data entry, which are utilized in the administration of the personnel security program.</p>
<p>Contractors shall ensure their availability to process needed work in a timely manner. A minimum of 36 hours and 4 days per week is required. Contractors are responsible for providing adequate office coverage with their respective team; to include holiday and high vacation/travel months. Failure to meet necessary availability may result in termination of the BPA. The minimum hour and days per week is subject to availability of Bureau funds and program office workload and can be altered at any time without prior notification.</p>
<p>Payment for Services and Scheduling<br />In compliance with ATF's specific invoicing procedures, contractors must submit a request for payment detailing the number of hours worked. All claims for payment or reimbursement shall be subject to audit and adjustment.</p>
<p>Contractors will be paid at the rate of $56.00 per hour for each hour up to and including 40 hours or otherwise established rate as determined by ATF. Contractors shall not work more than ten hours per day without prior approval from the COTR, Branch Chief or designee. Hours authorized and worked in excess of 40 hours per week will be paid at the rate of $84.00; the need for additional work hours must be agreed upon and have prior approval from the COTR, Branch Chief or designee.</p>
<p>Contractors are afforded a 15-minute break for each 4-hour period worked; they shall not be compensated for breaks greater than 15 minutes. Contractors must claim a minimum of 15-minutes for lunch each day worked; they shall not be compensated for time taken for lunch. Contractors will not be compensated for parking fees and travel to and from work.</p>
<p>ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services. This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations. Consequently, contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract. Contractors are further advised that the third party is required to make payments in the same timely manner as ATF. The third party contractor also will provide means for each contractor to register, enroll, and review the status of account payments through an on-line system. Specific details of this arrangement will be provided to each contractor if and when the third party source is identified.</p>
<p>Performance and Access to ATF Materials and Information <br />Contractors are responsible for safeguarding information. Background investigation information is protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 and, unless classified, is Sensitive but Unclassified Information (SBU). SBU must not be transmitted via unsecured email or Internet, or disclosed to unauthorized parties. Contractors must never furnish or divulge SBU contained in an investigation. Each contractor must make every reasonable effort to protect data associated with a background investigation. Data, notes, copies of testimonies, copies of ROIs, etc., are the sole property of ATF and must be safeguarded against unlawful disclosure.</p>
<p>Each contractor, when working in the PSB, must carry themselves in a manner that reflects positively on ATF. To that end, contractors, when on duty, should present themselves in a professional manner, be neatly groomed, and appropriately attired. Contractors must promote a positive workplace environment. Complaints of inappropriate conduct or performance may be investigated, and if substantiated, may result in the BPA being terminated. Contractors must exhibit professional qualities during all periods of performance and absolute integrity is required and expected. Contractors must be polite and professional in both conduct and appearance.</p>
<p>Contractors will have access to ATF's computer network and are required to successfully complete a series of mandatory online training courses; some may require an annual recertification. Currently, the ATF requires all contractors to complete the following courses: Introduction to National Security Information, Information Security Awareness with Acknowledgement of the Rules of Behavior and Social Engineering, Emergency Preparedness, IS-700: FEMA - National Incident Management System and IS-100.LE - ICS 100 for Law Enforcement Personnel. Additional training may be assigned at any time without prior notification and must be completed when requested by COTR, Branch Chief or designee. Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement. Any identification media, ATF provided software, and all other Government property must be surrendered when requested by the PSB.</p>
<p>Contractors should never use ATF credentials for investigating any matter not assigned to them by ATF, the PSB or for any personal gain. Contractors must not allow their credentials to be photocopied or taken from their possession. Lost or stolen credentials should be reported to the PSB immediately, as well as the local police department.</p>
<p>Contractors, who wish to terminate their BPA with the ATF, prior to its expiration, must notify the PSB with a minimum 30 day written notice.</p>
<p>Security and/or Suitability Screening<br />Each contractor must be able to obtain and maintain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) and receive a Top Secret clearance. This investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of the PSB, and be performed under such standards as the PSB may establish. A favorable adjudication of the SSBI must be determined by ATF prior to access to ATF information, information technology systems, and unescorted access to facilities.</p>
<p>Failure to timely complete the required background forms, have a background investigation favorably adjudicated or receive a Top Secret clearance constitutes grounds for disqualification of the contractor. The contractor is advised that this investigation may take 60 days or more to complete, depending upon the complexities of the issues. ATF will conduct a Periodic Reinvestigation on contract investigators every five years. Should the contractor be disqualified, he or she will not be granted unescorted access to any ATF facility, and access to ATF proprietary information or data will not be authorized.</p>
<p>Contractors may be required to complete a Conduct and Integrity Certification and Agency Specific Qualification Certification prior to submitting a formal background investigation package. Failure to adhere to ATF's conduct and integrity guidelines and/or be in compliance with DOJ and ATF agency specific qualifications may result in immediate disqualification.</p>
<p>Dun and Bradstreet Registration and System for Award Management <br />Contractors must obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and have a current registration in System for Award Management (SAM) for payment via electronic funds transfer. SAM requires that registrations must be recertified on an annual basis in order to remain active. The contractor is responsible for making changes to his/her own information. Any change to the contractor's name, address, telephone number, company name, tax identification number, or financial institution information must be made by the contractor in SAM. It is vital contractors keep their registration current. In addition, contractors must notify the PSB and the ATF Financial Management Division of any changes so the proper updates can be made to all systems.</p>
<p>Contractor Certification<br />Each contractor must complete a Contractor Certification which declares that any submission of a contractor's request for payment and any supplemental material, whether submitted in hard copy or electronic format, represents actual hours worked and/or actual reported investigative work that was performed and conducted in compliance with requirements of the awarded BPA.</p>
<p>Facilities<br />ATF agrees to furnish the equipment and facilities to allow contractors to perform the duties expected of them. Post of Duty: 99 New York Avenue, NE, Washington, DC 20226.</p>
<p>Deliverables<br />Contractor tasks will be assessed on a continuing basis. Tasks will be performed in a manner acceptable to the PSB and must be accomplished in accordance with personnel security guidelines and branch procedures.</p>
<p>Solicitation<br />ATF intends to issue vendors a BPA that will be available for placing calls/orders through April 30, 2014. The solicitation will close April 1st, 2013. All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) vendors. A BPA will be awarded after all evaluations are passed, tentative selections are made, interviews completed and background investigations adjudicated favorably.</p>
<p>Vendors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA. Vendors are hereby notified that any BPA issued under this solicitation will expire no later than April 30, 2014 and may be terminated prior to this date should changes to procurement types and authorities be implemented. A BPA is not a contract. A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish and eliminate the need for more complex acquisition methods. There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity. All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected vendor, or the call will be transferred to another vendor. Calls/orders may be competed among all vendors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF representative. The BPA and the contractor's responsibilities thereunder are subject changes in Federal law, regulation and policy, which may include, but are not limited to, procedural changes related to the use of government equipment, security procedures and investigative priorities. Modifications may be sent to vendors via mail or electronic mail. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 Investigation Services, and is the appropriate designation required by the CCR.</p>
<p>The following clauses are incorporated in full force: FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror - Commercial Items (Oct. 00) and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial (incorporated by reference). Each offeror must be willing to submit a completed copy of the provisions set forth in FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items, FAR 52.209-5, Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters and provide a statement proving they have read and understand the term and Conditions set forth in the FAR 52.212-4. These three documents will be provided to the vendor, by the PSB, when and if a tentative offer for award is extended.</p>
<p>EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.<br />Capability of the Vendor.<br />ATF will consider BPAs to vendors, as needed, on a pass/fail basis, based on past performance and experience, and the vendor's acceptability (the acceptance of ATF terms and conditions including the hourly rate). All vendors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with SAM. These are mandatory requirements and any firm will be eliminated that fails to comply. Vendors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability. Vendors rated as "passed" will be awarded points for past performance and experience. Vendors with an overall score of at least 68 points and that meet the mandatory requirements will be considered for issuance of a BPA and award will be made to those companies receiving the highest scores. At least 56 points must come from Offeror Demonstrated Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance and 12 must come from Vendor Capabilities.</p>
<p>A. Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance (80 Points): Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing. A minimum of three years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended. ATF will evaluate each vendor's experience on the basis of its breadth, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting and/or administering personnel security background investigations in the federal environment, as well as computer proficiency. ATF may assess the vendor's communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a vendor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations. ATF may contact some of the vendor's customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the vendor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the vendor's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the vendor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the vendor was committed to customer satisfaction. In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to: other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases. Contractors with recent ATF experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided to ATF. ATF will consider performance that contractors have previously rendered to ATF to be more influential than past performance rendered to another source. (56 points minimum).</p>
<p>B. Capabilities (20 Points): Capabilities are the vendor's ability to adhere to agency and program requirements. (12 points minimum).</p>
<p>Acceptability<br />ATF will determine the acceptability of each vendor offer on a "pass" or "fail" basis. A vendor's offer is acceptable when it manifests the vendor's assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including attachments and amendments (if any). If a vendor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, ATF will consider its offer to be unacceptable. Vendors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so.</p>

<DESC>The requirements for this contract are to provide advisory and assistance services to DSCA to support the MoDA program which deploys DoD civilians to serve as advisors to partner nation Ministries of Defense or similar government organizations in order to build effective and accountable security institutions. Over 80 advisors are currently deployed to Afghanistan. The FY12 National Defense Authorization Act grants authority for the MoDA program to deploy DoD civilian advisors worldwide. Due to this rapid program growth, the MoDA program office requires contractor support in the areas of human resources, operations support, training, assessment, reach-back development, and global outreach efforts. The contractor will support the full range of MoDA program functions detailed under the requirements section.<br />To perform this work successfully requires special and expert knowledge, skills and experience in disciplines not resident within DSCA. Continued utilization of contractors with specialized knowledge and expertise is required in accomplishing critical, time-sensitive tasks. The advice and consultancy requested is intended to provide sound recommendations and products in a wide range of cross-functional areas, as shown in Part 5 below. The specific work effort related to these areas will be explained, prioritized, and further clarified on a regular basis by the COR.<br />

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number is OPM2613Q0115 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document incorporates all mandatory commercial item provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-66 dated February 28, 2013.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 611430 and the small business size standard is $10.0 million. This procurement is set-aside exclusively for small businesses, allowing only a small business to submit proposals.</p>
<p>The U.S. Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Center for Leadership Development (CLD) provides high quality leadership and management development for supervisors, managers and executives across the Federal government through both multi-agency and single-agency designed courses. OPM has established two leadership institutes, the Federal Executive Institute in Charlottesville (FEI), Virginia, and the Management Development Center's (MDC's) with locations in Shepherdstown, West Virginia and Aurora, Colorado. OPM also offers courses at the OPM Headquarters in Washington, D.C. and at other locations. <br /><br />As a Federal business enterprise, CLD provides services that assist Federal agencies in achieving their missions by providing competency-based leadership programs to build great leaders for great government.</p>
<p>One single-agency course offered by CLD is the Mid-Level Transitions (MLT): Developing Leaders for the Future course for the U.S. Custom and Immigration Services (USCIS). The USCIS MLT teaches the "leadership" aspects of mid-level managers and provides the leadership tools needed to transition successfully into a managerial role. Participants learn critical skills to lead employees, and are assessed for leadership competencies via an OPM 360 degree assessment and one-on-one coaching. Participants are exposed to principles of Managing in Challenging Times, Coaching for Development, Political Savvy, Leading through Power and Influence, Conflict Resolution for Managers, Managing a Virtual Workforce, Managing Change, and working with coaching trios to improve their leadership skills.</p>
<p>In support of its mission, OPM needs to acquire no more than (3) contractors to provide the overall delivery of the USCIS MLT to include: Visiting Program Director (VPD), Instructor, and 360 Coaching services.</p>
<p>OPM intends to award no more than (3) Firm-fixed Price purchase orders to the offeror(s) that represents the best value to the government. The offeror(s) shall provide all labor, incidental materials, and other services necessary to render services under the resulting contract, see Statement of Objectives (SOO) detailed below.

Quotations submitted in response to this notice shall include the solicitation number in the subject line and be signed, dated and submitted via email to Shannon.Kennedy@opm.gov.</p>
<p>Technical and Pricing proposals MUST be in two separate files. If your technical and price proposals are not submitted in two separate files, your response to this solicitation will be considered non-responsive and will not be given any further consideration. Each of the parts shall be separate and complete, so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of and concurrently with the evaluation of the others.<br />All communications shall be directed to the attention of:</p>

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Centers for Environmental Prediction, intends to award on a sole source basis, under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements to University of Notre Dame for the Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) tide and surge model. The estimated value is $125,000.00.
<p>The western coastline of Alaska spans over 10,000 km of diverse topography ranging from the low-lying tundra of the Arctic Circle to the sharp volcanic relief of the southwest archipelago. This area is highly susceptible to coastal storms, which can cause coastal erosion, flooding, and have other pernicious effects to the environment and commercial efforts. The reduction in ice coverage due to climate change could potentially increase the frequency and degree of coastal flooding and erosion. In addition, estuarine and deltaic systems act as effective conduits for storm surge, so under the case of reduced near shore ice coverage, these systems could introduce storm surge into terrestrial environments unaccustomed to saline intrusion, flooding, or other alien biogeochemical factors.</p>
<p>The Government requires the development of an accurate, efficient, and robust high performance computational model of the western Alaska's coastal environment that can be used to simulate tides, surge, and wind waves, include the effect sea ice has on these processes. Evaluate this model for use in a forecasting capacity by the National Weather Service, and for design by the United States Army Corps of Engineers or Local Agencies.</p>
<p>University of Notre Dame is the key developer of ADCIRC tide and surge model in operational use by NOAA. University of Notre Dame possesses unique knowledge and abilities making them the only external source able to execute the required development activities.</p>
<p>Vendors who believe that they have the ability to meet this requirement should submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating that they can meet the Government's needs to fulfill this requirement. Failure to submit sufficient documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses must be received within the 15 days of this publication.</p>
<p>If any firms have questions regarding this requirement, contact Shalisha Harris, Contracting Officer at (301) 628-1378 or shalisha.harris@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>Submit written questions to Shalisha Harris no later than March 29, 2013.The closing date is April 5, 2013, 11a.m. Eastern Standard Time</p>

<DESC>Plague is a highly virulent vector-borne disease that has had dramatic effects on populations of many species of mammals (including humans) worldwide.  Plague was introduced to North America from Asia ca. 1900, spread throughout the western United States by 1950s, and invaded western South Dakota in 2005.  It is the primary threat to conservation of federally listed Utah prairie dogs and black-footed ferrets.  The disease may be spread among prairie dog colonies by other species of rodents that live in the intervening habitat.  The USGS Fort Collins Science Center (FORT) is conducting a research study to identify which species of rodents are responsible for maintaining and spreading plague.   The USGS-FORT Principal Investigator (PI) requires a contractor to assist in the conduct of this study in the vicinity of Badlands National Park, South Dakota.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>7. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>8. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Brenda.l.lentz@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>9. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 1100 Pacific Time on 29 MAR 2013.</p>

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Centers for Environmental Prediction, intends to award on a sole source basis, under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements to University of Notre Dame for the Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) tide and surge model. The estimated value is $125,000.00.
<p>The western coastline of Alaska spans over 10,000 km of diverse topography ranging from the low-lying tundra of the Arctic Circle to the sharp volcanic relief of the southwest archipelago. This area is highly susceptible to coastal storms, which can cause coastal erosion, flooding, and have other pernicious effects to the environment and commercial efforts. The reduction in ice coverage due to climate change could potentially increase the frequency and degree of coastal flooding and erosion. In addition, estuarine and deltaic systems act as effective conduits for storm surge, so under the case of reduced near shore ice coverage, these systems could introduce storm surge into terrestrial environments unaccustomed to saline intrusion, flooding, or other alien biogeochemical factors.</p>
<p>The Government requires the development of an accurate, efficient, and robust high performance computational model of the western Alaska's coastal environment that can be used to simulate tides, surge, and wind waves, include the effect sea ice has on these processes. Evaluate this model for use in a forecasting capacity by the National Weather Service, and for design by the United States Army Corps of Engineers or Local Agencies.</p>
<p>University of Notre Dame is the key developer of ADCIRC tide and surge model in operational use by NOAA. University of Notre Dame possesses unique knowledge and abilities making them the only external source able to execute the required development activities.</p>
<p>Vendors who believe that they have the ability to meet this requirement should submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating that they can meet the Government's needs to fulfill this requirement. Failure to submit sufficient documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses must be received within the 15 days of this publication.</p>
<p>If any firms have questions regarding this requirement, contact Shalisha Harris, Contracting Officer at (301) 628-1378 or shalisha.harris@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>Submit written questions to Shalisha Harris no later than March 27, 2013.The closing date is April 5, 2013, 11a.m. Eastern Standard Time</p>

<DESC>AFLCMC/EBYA, Contracting Office, Eglin AFB FL is planning to procure spare components in support of the BQM-167 Air Force Subscale Aerial Target (AFSAT) program in 1st quarter FY14. AFSATs are used by the 53d Weapons Evaluation Group (WEG) to test and evaluate air-to-air and surface-to-air weapon systems. The Air Force currently procures the BQM-167A target, produced by Composite Engineering Inc. (CEi), to meet this need. The Government does not own a technical data package for the BQM-167A target system and its peculiar support equipment and therefore cannot provide this data to interested parties.<br />Schedule is critical for the procurement and delivery of spares, and any potential source must be able to deliver these items within the required timeframe to meet critical mission requirements. Potential sources must be capable of providing all the spare items required (~250 unique items in total), not a subset. The Government plans to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract in FY14 that will extend through FY18, and issue delivery orders on a quarterly basis to meet ongoing spares requirements. Spare components to be procured include, but are not limited, to the items listed in Attachment #1:<br />Potential offerors who are capable of meeting the Air Force's spare requirements and delivery schedules outlined above are invited to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC). The offeror's SOC shall clearly demonstrate that: (1) it is capable of producing the spare components listed above within the delivery lead times specified; (2) the delivered spare components are produced in compliance with "International Standard ISO 9001, Quality Management Systems Requirements; and (3) spare components delivered will meet form, fit, and performance requirements for physical and functional compatibility with the BQM-167A aerial target system to include target and associated support equipment. The SOC shall be limited to 25 pages including attachments. Responses are requested by&nbsp;22 April 2013.
<p><br />The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition is 336413 with a size standard of 1,000 employees. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the government to any specific acquisition approach. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an IFB or RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment to contract by the Government. Contracting POC is Capt Trent Fritz at AFLCMC/EBYA, 207 West D Avenue, Suite 214, Eglin AF, FL 32542-6853 or at trent.fritz@eglin.af.mil. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.

<DESC>M734A1 Multi-Option and M783 Point Detonating/Delay Mortar Fuze Market Survey  <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army Contracting Command (ACC) - New Jersey NJ 07806-5000 (Installation: Picatinny Arsenal), in support of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (OPM-CAS), is conducting a market survey to identify qualified sources to produce the M734A1 Multi-Option and M783 Point Detonating/Delay Mortar Fuzes.  The M734A1 fuze has four selectable functions: two proximity Height of Burst settings (60/81 PRX and 120 PRX); Impact (IMP); and Delay (DLY). The M783 fuze has Impact and Delay capability and shares many of the same components as the M734A1. The M734A1 and the M783 Fuze can be used on 60mm, 81mm, and 120mm High Explosive (HE) and 60mm and 120mm White Phosphorous (WP) Smoke Cartridges. The two fuzes will be procured under the same contract.  <br>    <br>  The Offeror must possess the necessary skills and facilities to fabricate and deliver the above components. Potential candidates must have manufacturing experience for similarly complex fuze production. Subject to approval, competition is limited to U.S. and Canadian sources.   <br>    <br>  The U.S. Government anticipates soliciting for offerors located within the National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB) for a single award, Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) delivery order contract for a basic award of five (5) ordering periods to cover requirements for Fiscal Years (FY) 2015 through 2019.  Multiple ID/IQ contracts are not being considered due to Economic production considerations. The estimated quantities to be purchased over the five ordering periods are approximately 439,357 M783 Fuzes and 145,230 M734A1 fuzes.  Both the M783 and the M734A1 fuze shall be manufactured to a Government owned Technical Data Package (TDP), drawings, and specifications, which are coded as Distribution Statement D (authorized distribution of technical documents to Department of Defense components and their contractors). The TDP will be made available through the Procuring Contracting Officer upon request, and after submission of a valid DD2345 and signed Non-disclosure Agreement (NDA).  <br>    <br>  Interested contractors should submit a summary that includes a brief description of the contractor's capabilities to include: parent organizations, name/address/point of contact identification/email address, capabilities, past experience as a manufacturer of fuzes or similar items, monthly production capacity and/or potential capacity, possible partnering/teaming arrangements, or if the company is a large or small business and CAGE Code. This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the US Government. All information submitted will be held in a confidential status. Interested firms should provide this requested information to Mike Samra via email ONLY to: michael.w.samra.civ@mail.mil within 30 calendar days of this publication. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted. The Government will accept written questions by email. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the U.S. Government.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT (SSA) AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT, INVITATION FOR BIDS, REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS, OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. IT IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ACQUIRE ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, NOR DOES THE GOVERNMENT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. <br>  <br> The purpose of this SSA is to identify potential sources capable of providing up to twelve (12) Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance Systems (EMARSS) and Integrated Contractor Logistics Support (ICLS) for EMARSS within forty-two (42) months of period of performance.  EMARSS is an ACAT II program of record with an approved Milestone B decision and is the Army's future force airborne intelligence collection, processing, and targeting support system.  EMARSS is a manned multi-INT Airborne Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) system that provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify/identify, and track surface targets in day/night, near-all-weather conditions with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy.  EMARSS aircraft will be located within Aerial Exploitation Battalions (AEB), which are assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM). The EMARSS system will consist of a commercial derivative aircraft, Beechcraft King Air 350ER with Proline 21 cockpit, equipped with Electro-optic/Infrared (EO/IR) Full Motion Video (FMV) sensor, a COMINT collection system, an Aerial Precision Guidance (APG) system, line-of-site (LOS) tactical and beyond line-of-site (LOS/BLOS) communications suites, two operator workstations and a self-protection suite.  The technical requirements of EMARSS are available as an attachment to this announcement. <br>  <br> EMARSS will operate as a single platform in support of tactical missions.  Mission altitude and flight tracks are chosen to optimize sensor data collection on the target area of interest while avoiding known threats.  Flight tracks may be selected to strike a balance among the capabilities of multiple sensors, or to optimize collection from individual sensors based upon the daily collection tasking dictated by the tactical commanders Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs).  EMARSS will provide efficient response to Combat Forces ISR tasking with centralized Processing, Exploitation & Dissemination (PED) of ISR while simultaneously transmitting critical FMV and intelligence products to engaged tactical forces.  <br>  <br> Your response will be treated only as information for the Government to consider.  You will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this SSA. Furthermore, this request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated or received for this effort.  The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy, Statement of Work/Performance Work Statements and/or Statement of Objectives.  Interested parties are responsible to adequately mark proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response accordingly <br>    <br>  Any potential response shall address the following items:  <br>    <br> 1) Identify how many EMARSS could be delivered within a forty-two (42) month period of performance. The responses shall explain how many EMARSS could be delivered within the period of performance based on one or both of the following scenarios:  <br>  <br> a) Contractor designs and develops EMARSS.  Identify the candidate sensors the contractor would recommend as part of their design on EMARSS to the extent possible. This would require EMARSS to successfully pass developmental and operational testing within the first twenty-one (21) months.  The contractor shall be responsible for attaining an Army Airworthiness Release (AWR) within the first twenty-one (21) months. The contractor would also be responsible for production acceptance testing.   <br>  <br> b) Contractor requires a technical data package (TDP) to build EMARSS. (The TDP would only be in 3D CATIA format).  The contractor will be responsible for conducting a First Article Test and Production Acceptance Testing.  Any deviations from the design would need Government approval, and may require the contractor to perform additional testing and/or update the AWR with the Aviation Engineering Directorate (AED). <br>  <br> 2) APG, Blue Force Tracking-Aviation, Distributed Command Ground System - Army software, Orion workstation control software, and Precision Strike Suite - Special Operation Forces software may all be assumed to be provided as Government Furnished Property/Software.  Identify any additional Government Furnished Property/Software that would be required to meet the Government's schedule.    <br>  <br> 3) Provide information as to how your company can provide EMARSS ICLS services for all technical issues for CONUS and OCONUS EMARSS systems.  <br>  <br> 4) Provide information regarding the ability to provide engineering and technical services for the EMARSS, including technology insertion, system upgrades and system integration.  Demonstrate the company's expertise in supply chain and logistics management. <br>  <br> 5)  Address in detail with supporting data company's recent relevant work performance and/or current work experience in the performing similar efforts with the same level of complexity and scale for the U.S. Government.  Company may provide work experience and past performance data related to affiliated companies and as such that work experience and past performance data will be identified as to the affiliated company submitting a response. <br>  <br> Responses to this SSA must be unclassified and shall be limited to thirty (30) pages to include all attachments and exhibits.

A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 22 - 600 - Long Beach Healthcare System is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use.

While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Lab and Field Supplies - RFI Update<br />Question re Electronic / Searchable Retail Catalog Availability<br />March 21, 2013</strong></p>
<p>While the deadline for full RFI submissions is past,&nbsp;EPA has a question for all interested contractors.</p>
<p>Based on feedback obtained from RFI responses, EPA is considering establishing an open market BPA rather than the planned approach of issuing a BPA to GSA contract holders. Pricing would be based on a vendor's retail catalog rather than their GSA contract catalog. In order to understand whether this approach is feasible, we would like to know whether contractors would be able to provide a full catalog of available items and pricing in an electronic and searchable format</p>
<p>Please respond to this question, letting us know whether you would be able to provide an electronic version of your full catalog and pricing as part of an RFQ response. Please note that we are not asking for your catalog at this time. Rather, we want to know if you would be able to provide a catalog of available items and pricing if requested in the upcoming solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>Email your responses to: bowman.janetb@epa.gov by Thursday, March 28, 2013.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you again for your help in ensuring the EPA is able to establish a BPA that is effective for both EPA and our industry partners.<br /></p>
<p>==================================================== <br /><strong>Original Request for RFI Submissions<br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY<br />LABORATORY AND FIELD SUPPLIES <br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)</strong></p>
<p>===========================================================<br /><strong><br />Disclaimer<br /></strong><br />This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ), Invitation for Quote (IFQ), or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services. Responses to this RFI are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract of any nature. The Government will not award a contract based on this RFI. The Government reserves the right to determine how it should proceed as a result of this notice. Responding parties should not anticipate Government feedback on their respective submissions. The Government will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. All information solicited and received in this RFI will be treated as information only. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.<br />==========================================================<br /><strong><br />PURPOSE<br /></strong><br /><strong>RFI:</strong> This Request for Information is issued for the purpose of gathering data on small businesses with the ability to provide the products and services needed to support EPA's Laboratory and Field Supplies requirements. The overall objective is to get feedback from industry for our initiative to establish an EPA-enterprise approach to sourcing laboratory and field supplies. This approach will include establishing a web-based ordering portal available across all EPA labs and data reporting available at the EPA level. Of particular importance is the supply market's capability to (1) maintain an ordering portal with EPA-specific pricing and (2) meet EPA supplies needs through GSA contracts and/or open market.<br /><br /><strong>Industry Day:</strong> Related to the RFI, a virtual Laboratory and Field Supplies Industry Day was announced on FedBizOpp.Gov on February 11, 2013. Industry Day will be held on February 26, 2013 at 1:00 p.m. See the FedBizOpps Special Notice, "Lab Supplies Industry Day" for details. Interested contractors are encouraged to attend the virtual Industry Day.<br /><strong><br />BACKGROUND<br /></strong><br />In response to the OMB's strategic sourcing initiative, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted a spend analysis of its Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 acquisition data and concluded that the "laboratory supplies" commodity area represents an excellent opportunity for strategic sourcing. The EPA spends approximately $7 million annually via purchase card in this commodity area.<br /><br />The agency's key laboratory organizations are the Office of Research and Development, the Programs, and the Regions. There are approximately 40 agency laboratory units across the continental US that serve these organizations. There are a wide variety of mission specific and generic supplies that are routinely acquired.<br /><br />The EPA intends to award one or more single or multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) as a small business set aside. Depending on the results of market research, the BPA(s) may be established with GSA contract holders or non-GSA contractors (open market).<br /><br /><strong>Description of Information Requested<br /></strong><br />The Government requests that you read through this RFI, as well as the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW) and its three attachments, and fill in the requested information in the four spreadsheets in the Price Quote Workbook: (1) Contractor Information, (2) Categories, (3) Category Manufacturers, and (4) Specific Products, and the spreadsheet in the Online Ordering Features Workbook.<br /><br />Responses to this RFI may be evaluated by Government technical experts drawn from staff within EPA and/or by selected support contractor personnel. Support contractors will be bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and must be clearly marked.<br /><br /><strong>STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)<br /></strong><br />EPA is currently assessing the ability of industry to meet its laboratory and field supplies needs as well as to provide an on-line ordering interface and periodic detailed reporting. The attached Draft SOW represents the SOW EPA plans to present to industry to meet these needs.<br /><br /><strong>REQUESTED INFORMATION<br /></strong><br />Please answer the following questions and provide the requested information to assist the EPA in understanding industry capabilities:<br />1. To the extent willing, please provide the requested information in the spreadsheets within the Price Quote and Online Ordering workbooks attached to the SOW (See Attachments 1 and 2.). The EPA understands substantial time and resources are required on your company's part to provide EPA with requested information, but your responses will provide significant input into EPA's identification o f a mutually the best contract strategy for acquiring laboratory and field supplies. We appreciate your efforts to help EPA design a mutually beneficial solution. <br />2. Online Ordering Features: <br />a. Do you have the ability to serve EPA's labs in the manner described above and in the draft SOW (web portal, reporting requirements, etc.)?<br />b. If not, under what conditions would you be willing to take steps to support this type of contract?<br />c. How long would be required to establish the ability to support EPA's labs in this manner?<br />3. What challenges do you foresee in supporting the EPA requirements outlined in the draft SOW?<br />4. What suggestions do you have for developing a more cost effective EPA-wide lab &amp; field supplies program?<br />5. Are there any changes to the draft SOW that would make it more attractive to you as a contractor? Please describe.<br />6. What suggestions do you have regarding the Performance Metrics table on pages 7 and 8 in the Draft SOW?<br /><br /><strong>What Should Be Included in Your Response </strong></p>
<p>1. Do submit succinct, thoughtful responses to the questions listed in this RFI. <br />2. Do provide all information requested in attached spreadsheets.<br />3.

<DESC>This amendment posts the original attachment. <br>  <br> This is a Request for Information (RFI).  This RFI working group announcement supports general program planning related to evolving the PM TRADE standards portfolio in a collaborative working group environment.  This RFI will not result in a contract action related to interface standards development.   This working group is strictly voluntary.    <br>    <br>  PM TRADE is seeking industry participation, support, and feedback on identifying, maturing, and instantiating key Live Training interface standards. This is an opportunity for industry to provide knowledge, insight, and recommendations in shaping the logical partitions and in developing key Live Training interface standards with the government.  Adhering to these key interface standards will be a requirement in future programs.  <br>    <br>  Interdependencies across the PM TRADE product line portfolio are becoming more prevalent and necessitate that non-proprietary PM TRADE wide interface standards must be established and actively managed to ensure continuity in development and sustainment.  Through vendor-neutral interface standards, PM TRADE's intent is to reduce the total cost of ownership, improve interoperability, and implement an architecture that supports technology and component insertion.   Upon publishing, these PM TRADE non-proprietary interfaces and associated software will be configuration managed under the LT2 construct.  Refer to the attachment for additional information. This specific initiative does not impact and is separate from the FASIT interface standards.  <br>    <br>  On 2 April 2013 PM TRADE will host an Industry Day to initiate key Live Training interface standards development. See the attachment for details. Each company is requested to RSVP via email to Rob.Wolf1@us.army.mil by COB on 27 March 2013 with the information listed below.  Questions related to this working group shall be submitted in writing and addressed to Rob.Wolf1@us.army.mil and christie.p.martinez@us.army.mil

This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011.<br><br>PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.  This acquisition will require access to information classified as "Sensitive but Unclassified" or "For Official Use Only".<br><br>BACKGROUND:<br>The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.  It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range.  Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification.<br><br>INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT:<br>1.  Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST, apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon, and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range.<br>     a.  System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics.<br>     b.  Pseudo real-time Line Of Sight (LOS) correlation to the projection screen.<br>     c.  Pseudo real-time Point of Aim (POA)/Point of Impact (POI) for all rounds fired.<br>     d.  High fidelity After Action Review (AAR) at student and Instructor Operator Station (IOS).<br>     e.  High fidelity weapon interface for Form, Fit and Function with Magazine loading.<br>     f.  All U.S. Army standard Courses of Fire (COF) with results feedback on doctrine scorecard.<br>     g.  Provides pre and post aim point trace for individual weapons.<br>     h.  Provides burst by burst trace for machine gun weapons.<br><br>2.  Ability to provide training events that support realistic physics-based modeling for environments and models with variable outcomes.<br><br>3.  Sufficient intellectual property rights in the interface protocols for the Government to allow a third-party contractor to maintain and repair the system and its weapons.<br><br>4.  Ability to support High Definition Television (HDTV) format interactive video training events for judgmental use of force SDS training.<br><br>5.  Provide ongoing ability to integrate the Army POR for gaming (currently Virtual Battlespace 2 (VBS 2) into the system.<br><br>HANDS ON INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITY:<br>Respondents are invited to use the EST located at PEO STRI, Orlando, for a period of up to 2 business days from 23 January 2012 - 24 February 2012.

This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011.<br><br>PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that Offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.  This acquisition will require access to information classified as "Sensitive but Unclassified" or "For Official Use Only".<br><br>BACKGROUND:<br>The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains Soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.  It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range.  Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification.<br><br>INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT:<br>1.  Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST, apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon, and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range.<br>     a. System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics.<br>     b. Pseudo real-time Line Of Sight (LOS) correlation to the projection screen.<br>     c. Pseudo real-time Point of Aim (POA)/Point of Impact (POI) for all rounds fired.<br>     d. High fidelity After Action Review (AAR) at student and Instructor Operator Station (IOS).<br>     e. High fidelity weapon interface for Form, Fit and Function with Magazine loading.<br>     f. All U.S. Army standard Courses of Fire (COF) with results feedback on doctrine scorecard.<br>     g. Provides pre and post aim point trace for individual weapons.<br>     h. Provides burst by burst trace for machine gun weapons.<br><br>2.  Ability to provide training events that support realistic physics-based modeling for environments and models with variable outcomes.<br><br>3.  Sufficient intellectual property rights in the interface protocols for the Government to allow a third-party contractor to maintain and repair the system and its weapons.<br><br>4.  Ability to support High Definition Television (HDTV) format interactive video training events for judgmental use of force SDS training.<br><br>5.  Provide ongoing ability to integrate the Army POR for gaming (currently Virtual Battle space 2 (VBS 2) into the system.<br><br>HANDS ON INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITY:<br>Respondents are invited to use the EST located at PEO STRI, Orlando, for a period of up to 2 business days from 23 January 2012 - 24 February 2012.

This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011.<br><br>PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that Offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.  This acquisition will require access to information classified as "Sensitive but Unclassified" or "For Official Use Only".<br><br>BACKGROUND:<br>The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains Soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.  It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range.  Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification.<br><br>INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT:<br>1.  Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST, apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon, and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range.<br>     a. System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics.<br>     b. Pseudo real-time Line Of Sight (LOS) correlation to the projection screen.<br>     c. Pseudo real-time Point of Aim (POA)/Point of Impact (POI) for all rounds fired.<br>     d. High fidelity After Action Review (AAR) at student and Instructor Operator Station (IOS).<br>     e. High fidelity weapon interface for Form, Fit and Function with Magazine loading.<br>     f. All U.S. Army standard Courses of Fire (COF) with results feedback on doctrine scorecard.<br>     g. Provides pre and post aim point trace for individual weapons.<br>     h. Provides burst by burst trace for machine gun weapons.<br><br>2.  Ability to provide training events that support realistic physics-based modeling for environments and models with variable outcomes.<br><br>3.  Sufficient intellectual property rights in the interface protocols for the Government to allow a third-party contractor to maintain and repair the system and its weapons.<br><br>4.  Ability to support High Definition Television (HDTV) format interactive video training events for judgmental use of force SDS training.<br><br>5.  Provide ongoing ability to integrate the Army POR for gaming (currently Virtual Battle space 2 (VBS 2) into the system.<br><br>HANDS ON INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITY:<br>Respondents are invited to use the EST located at PEO STRI, Orlando, for a period of up to 2 business days from 23 January 2012 - 24 February 2012.

This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011.<br><br>PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that Offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.  This acquisition will require access to information classified as "Sensitive but Unclassified" or "For Official Use Only".<br><br>BACKGROUND:<br>The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains Soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.  It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range.  Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification.<br><br>INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT:<br>1.  Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST, apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon, and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range.<br>     a. System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics.<br>     b. Pseudo real-time Line Of Sight (LOS) correlation to the projection screen.<br>     c. Pseudo real-time Point of Aim (POA)/Point of Impact (POI) for all rounds fired.<br>     d. High fidelity After Action Review (AAR) at student and Instructor Operator Station (IOS).<br>     e. High fidelity weapon interface for Form, Fit and Function with Magazine loading.<br>     f. All U.S. Army standard Courses of Fire (COF) with results feedback on doctrine scorecard.<br>     g. Provides pre and post aim point trace for individual weapons.<br>     h. Provides burst by burst trace for machine gun weapons.<br><br>2.  Ability to provide training events that support realistic physics-based modeling for environments and models with variable outcomes.<br><br>3.  Sufficient intellectual property rights in the interface protocols for the Government to allow a third-party contractor to maintain and repair the system and its weapons.<br><br>4.  Ability to support High Definition Television (HDTV) format interactive video training events for judgmental use of force SDS training.<br><br>5.

This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011.<br><br>PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that Offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.  This acquisition will require access to information classified as "Sensitive but Unclassified" or "For Official Use Only".<br><br>BACKGROUND:<br>The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains Soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.  It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range.  Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification.<br><br>INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT:<br>1.  Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST, apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon, and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range.<br>     a. System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics.<br>     b. Pseudo real-time Line Of Sight (LOS) correlation to the projection screen.<br>     c. Pseudo real-time Point of Aim (POA)/Point of Impact (POI) for all rounds fired.<br>     d. High fidelity After Action Review (AAR) at student and Instructor Operator Station (IOS).<br>     e. High fidelity weapon interface for Form, Fit and Function with Magazine loading.<br>     f. All U.S. Army standard Courses of Fire (COF) with results feedback on doctrine scorecard.<br>     g. Provides pre and post aim point trace for individual weapons.<br>     h. Provides burst by burst trace for machine gun weapons.<br><br>2.  Ability to provide training events that support realistic physics-based modeling for environments and models with variable outcomes.<br><br>3.  Sufficient intellectual property rights in the interface protocols for the Government to allow a third-party contractor to maintain and repair the system and its weapons.<br><br>4.

This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011.<br><br>PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that Offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.  This acquisition will require access to information classified as "Sensitive but Unclassified" or "For Official Use Only".<br><br>BACKGROUND:<br>The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains Soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.  It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range.  Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification.<br><br>INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT:<br>1.  Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST, apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon, and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range.<br>     a. System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics.<br>     b. Pseudo real-time Line Of Sight (LOS) correlation to the projection screen.<br>     c. Pseudo real-time Point of Aim (POA)/Point of Impact (POI) for all rounds fired.<br>     d. High fidelity After Action Review (AAR) at student and Instructor Operator Station (IOS).<br>     e. High fidelity weapon interface for Form, Fit and Function with Magazine loading.<br>     f. All U.S. Army standard Courses of Fire (COF) with results feedback on doctrine scorecard.<br>     g. Provides pre and post aim point trace for individual weapons.<br>     h. Provides burst by burst trace for machine gun weapons.<br><br>2.  Ability to provide training events that support realistic physics-based modeling for environments and models with variable outcomes.<br><br>3.  Sufficient intellectual property rights in the interface protocols for the Government to allow a third-party contractor to maintain and repair the system and its weapons.<br><br>4.  Ability to support High Definition Television (HDTV) format interactive video training events for judgmental use of force SDS training.<br><br>5.  Provide ongoing ability to integrate the Army POR for gaming (currently Virtual Battle space 2 (VBS 2) into the system.<br><br>HANDS ON INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITY:<br>Respondents are invited to use the EST located at PEO STRI, Orlando, for a period of up to 2 business days from 23 January 2012 - 24 February 2012.

This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011. <br>  <br> PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that Offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.  This acquisition will require access to information classified as  quote mark Sensitive but Unclassified quote mark  or  quote mark For Official Use Only quote mark . <br>  <br> BACKGROUND: <br> The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains Soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.  It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range.  Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification. <br>  <br> INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT: <br> 1.  Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST, apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon, and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range. <br>      a. System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics. <br>      b. Pseudo real-time Line Of Sight (LOS) correlation to the projection screen. <br>      c. Pseudo real-time Point of Aim (POA)/Point of Impact (POI) for all rounds fired. <br>      d. High fidelity After Action Review (AAR) at student and Instructor Operator Station (IOS). <br>      e. High fidelity weapon interface for Form, Fit and Function with Magazine loading. <br>      f. All U.S. Army standard Courses of Fire (COF) with results feedback on doctrine scorecard. <br>      g. Provides pre and post aim point trace for individual weapons. <br>      h. Provides burst by burst trace for machine gun weapons. <br>  <br> 2.  Ability to provide training events that support realistic physics-based modeling for environments and models with variable outcomes. <br>  <br> 3.  Sufficient intellectual property rights in the interface protocols for the Government to allow a third-party contractor to maintain and repair the system and its weapons. <br>  <br> 4.  Ability to support High Definition Television (HDTV) format interactive video training events for judgmental use of force SDS training. <br>  <br> 5.  Provide ongoing ability to integrate the Army POR for gaming (currently Virtual Battle space 2 (VBS 2) into the system. <br>  <br> HANDS ON INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITY: <br> Respondents are invited to use the EST located at PEO STRI, Orlando, for a period of up to 2 business days from 23 January 2012 - 24 February 2012.

This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011.  <br>    <br>  PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that Offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.  This acquisition will require access to information classified as  quote mark Sensitive but Unclassified quote mark  or  quote mark For Official Use Only quote mark .  <br>    <br>  BACKGROUND:  <br>  The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains Soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.  It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range.  Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification.  <br>    <br>  INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT:  <br>  1.  Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST, apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon, and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range.  <br>       a. System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics.  <br>       b. Pseudo real-time Line Of Sight (LOS) correlation to the projection screen.  <br>       c. Pseudo real-time Point of Aim (POA)/Point of Impact (POI) for all rounds fired.  <br>       d. High fidelity After Action Review (AAR) at student and Instructor Operator Station (IOS).  <br>       e. High fidelity weapon interface for Form, Fit and Function with Magazine loading.  <br>       f. All U.S. Army standard Courses of Fire (COF) with results feedback on doctrine scorecard.  <br>       g. Provides pre and post aim point trace for individual weapons.  <br>       h. Provides burst by burst trace for machine gun weapons.  <br>    <br>  2.  Ability to provide training events that support realistic physics-based modeling for environments and models with variable outcomes.  <br>    <br>  3.  Sufficient intellectual property rights in the interface protocols for the Government to allow a third-party contractor to maintain and repair the system and its weapons.  <br>    <br>  4.  Ability to support High Definition Television (HDTV) format interactive video training events for judgmental use of force SDS training.  <br>    <br>  5.  Provide ongoing ability to integrate the Army POR for gaming (currently Virtual Battle space 2 (VBS 2) into the system.  <br>    <br>  HANDS ON INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITY:  <br>  Respondents are invited to use the EST located at PEO STRI, Orlando, for a period of up to 2 business days from 23 January 2012 - 24 February 2012.

This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011.   <br>      <br>   PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that Offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.  This acquisition will require access to information classified as  quote mark Sensitive but Unclassified quote mark  or  quote mark For Official Use Only quote mark .   <br>      <br>   BACKGROUND:   <br>   The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains Soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.  It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range.  Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification.   <br>      <br>   INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT:   <br>   1.  Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST, apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon, and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range.   <br>        a. System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics.   <br>        b.

This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011. <br>  <br> PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that Offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.  This acquisition will require access to information classified as  quote mark Sensitive but Unclassified quote mark  or  quote mark For Official Use Only quote mark . <br>  <br> BACKGROUND: <br> The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains Soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.  It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range.  Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification. <br>  <br> INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT: <br> 1.  Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST, apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon, and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range. <br>      a. System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics. <br>      b. Pseudo real-time Line Of Sight (LOS) correlation to the projection screen. <br>      c. Pseudo real-time Point of Aim (POA)/Point of Impact (POI) for all rounds fired. <br>      d. High fidelity After Action Review (AAR) at student and Instructor Operator Station (IOS). <br>      e. High fidelity weapon interface for Form, Fit and Function with Magazine loading. <br>      f. All U.S. Army standard Courses of Fire (COF) with results feedback on doctrine scorecard. <br>      g. Provides pre and post aim point trace for individual weapons. <br>      h. Provides burst by burst trace for machine gun weapons. <br>  <br> 2.  Ability to provide training events that support realistic physics-based modeling for environments and models with variable outcomes. <br>  <br> 3.  Sufficient intellectual property rights in the interface protocols for the Government to allow a third-party contractor to maintain and repair the system and its weapons. <br>  <br> 4.  Ability to support High Definition Television (HDTV) format interactive video training events for judgmental use of force SDS training. <br>  <br> 5.  Provide ongoing ability to integrate the Army POR for gaming (currently Virtual Battle space 2 (VBS 2) into the system. <br>  <br> HANDS ON INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITY: <br> Respondents are invited to use the EST located at PEO STRI, Orlando, for a period of up to 2 business days from 23 January 2012 - 24 February 2012.

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.106-1) with Aerius Photonics, LLC. (FLIR), 2223 Eastman Ave B, Ventura, CA 93003-5622, as the only responsible source that can provide 2 FLIR Tau2 640 and 1 FLIR SWIR 15XR Thermal Cameras. (The SWIR is a special order camera with special specifications which are not a normal item FLIR manufactures for distribution through retailers.)  <br>  <br> The basic requirements for this equipment are as follows: <br>  <br> Specifications for LWIR Camera: <br> Must have same form factor as a Tau generation-1 camera (1.75 quote mark  x 1.75 quote mark  x 1.18 quote mark ) (System must be able to use the same polarimetric mounts and software already developed for a Tau 640 camera) <br> Must have a 640x512 digital resolution <br> Must have a time to image of less than 4 seconds <br> Must include a Tau WFOV Lens Focus Tool   <br> Must include a tripod mounting adapter <br> Must support and include a camera link expansion board <br> Must include a 12V 4 quote mark  blackbody for gain calibration and supplemental FFV <br> Must include a 19mm lens (f/1.25) <br> Must not display an on-screen logo <br> Must have a 17u pixel pitch <br> Must have a 30 Hz refresh rate (NTSC) <br> Must have a sensitivity of 7.5 - 13.5 um <br>  <br> Specifications for SWIR Camera: <br> Resolution:  640x512 digital output (14-bit imagery) <br> Spectral Range: 0.6-1.7um (extended range) <br> Power Requirements:  12 VDC <br> Exposure Time:  500ns to 500ms <br> Mount:  System must be able to use the same polarimetric mounts and software already developed for a Tau 640 camera <br> Must have noise at sensor characteristics:  Low Gain  less than  200 e rms; High Gain  less than  35 e rms <br> Max Frame Rate: 30 Frames Per Second <br> Must Support Operating Temperature of -20 degrees C to 55 degrees C at full performance <br> Must include 25mm f/1.4 lens, which supports 0.8-1.7um sensitivity (C-mount) <br> Must include 5-meter camera link cable, a 0.5m analog MCX to BNC cable, and a 2-meter USB-A to USB mini B cable <br>  <br>  <br> The FLIR Tau2 640 and FLIR SWIR 15XR manufactured by Aerius Photonics LLC. meets these basic requirements. Since ERDC  EL already possesses an existing FLIR Tau 640 thermal camera, they have developed extensive software and mounting capabilities which make use of this form factor and the capabilities of this camera.  This system had a uniquely stable and controllable, automatic gain-control capability that made for good quality, low noise imagery over periods of changing thermal conditions. While they would like to purchase two more identical cameras to the Tau 640, this model has been discontinued and replaced with the FLIR Tau2 model line.  The Tau2 represents an improvement over the original Tau and has 640x512 with 17!-L  pitch and single pixel symbol resolution; however, there is no difference in the form factor or fit between Tau2 and the first generation Tau cameras.  It will be possible to run Tau imagery on existing ERDC software without the need to redevelop and calibrate new codes.  It will also be possible to use the ERDC  developed polarimetric mounts already developed for the Tau 640 with the new Tau2 camera.  Using this system will eliminate the need to change camera models or manufacturers preventing additional cost to the government. Purchase of any other system would require substantial software and hardware modifications. <br>  <br>  <br> This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement.  The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 334413 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including price, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same or similar product.  All capability statements received by the closing date of this publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  <br>  <br> Capability statements shall be submitted only by e-mail as a Microsoft Office Word, Microsoft Office Excel, or Adobe PDF attachment to Amanda.Andrews@usace.army.mil.  Statements are due by 1200 (12:00pm) Central Standard Time 15 February 2013.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because the procurement is awarded to a sole source under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (FAR 13.5). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br>  <br> MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD  <br> FOR OTHER THEN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION  <br> UNDER THE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION THRESHOLD  <br> 1. Contracting Agency: Southern Regional Contracting Office, Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC), Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234  <br>  <br> 2. Description of Action: Approval is requested to solicit a sole source acquisition with BioFire Diagnostics (BFDx); for FilmArray microbial identification test panel kits for use on government-owned FilmArray Analyzers. This action will be accomplished through the use of a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order.  <br>  <br> 3. Description of Products/Services: This action is for the purchase of the FilmArray reagent kits and consumables associated with the FilmArray test menu. BFDx FilmArray reagent kits are used to test various types of biological samples for the presence of pathogenic and biological treat agents using the BFDx FilmArray analyzers.  <br>  <br> 4. Authority Cited: 10 USC 2304(c) as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), Soliciting from a single source. For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name or industrial mobilization).  <br>  <br> 5. Reason for Cited Authority: AMEDD C&S utilizes specific analyzers in its mission as a multi-service Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) and the Next Generation Diagnostic System (NGDS) training center for the Department of Defense. BFDx FilmArray is the only designated laboratory system that is part of the NGDS training, test and evaluations. BFDx is the sole manufacturer of the FilmArray analyzer and related reagent kits, which are FDA approved for in-vitro diagnostics. Soliciting for competition would not be reasonable. Therefore Full and Open Competition need not be provided for.  <br>  <br>   <br> 6. Contracting Officer Certification: I certify this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  <br>  <br>  <br> Name:	Melissa Oliva <br> Title:	Contracting Officer <br>  <br>  <br> \\Original Signature\\ <br>  <br> Dated: 01 Mar 2013 <br>  <br>

<DESC><p>The required intellectual capital support will be delivered to the National Institute of Standards and<br />Technology in Gaithersburg, MD as the servicing acquisition provider.</p>
<p>The primary focus of this effort will be to provide professional staffing services to the Board of Directors<br />for the FirstNet for consultants to assist with planning and startup activities for FirstNet's nationwide public safety broadband network.</p>
<p>Subtitle B, Title VI of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of2012 (P.L. 112-60) defines the governance of public safety spectrum and creates FirstNet, which is responsible for establishing a nationwide, interoperable public safety broadband network. FirstNet is an independent authority within NTIA, and led by a Board of Directors, hereafter the Board. The Secretary of Commerce appointed the Board in August 2012 with assistance from NTIA.</p>
<p>The general duties and responsibilities of FirstNet are to build, deploy, and operate a nationwide public safety broadband network. To start-up FirstNet, the Board is seeking services from a professional staffing company who has the ability to hire consultants upon an immediate need or within an established need that can provide the Board with consultants that have expertise in a variety of subject areas. The Board expects the consultants to provide limited term assistance during the planning and start-up phase of the organization until the board is completely established and has the ability to hire permanent staff or acquires vendors to perform these specific functions for FirstNet.</p>
