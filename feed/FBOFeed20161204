<DESC>With continued U.S. Military presence in Afghanistan at current levels, the warehouse and logistics support services contract will continue to provide a mechanism to receive excess property and equipment, which will in turn continue to save the IPs and the U.S. taxpayers money. Additional services provided on this contract are the storage and destruction of secure armor equipment (SAE) and surplus program equipment from closed USAID awards.  The warehouse and logistics yard also provides for the storage of OE funded equipment should USAID needs it.
