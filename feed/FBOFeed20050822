<DESC>The National Science Foundation (NSF) Policy Office intends to issue a Competitive Firm-Fixed-Price contract for an Electronic Suite of NSF Policy Office Guidance Documents.  These are NSF policy and procedural documents that relate to the Foundation's proposal and award process; and provide vital information for use by offerors and NSF awardees.  These documents are all available electronically on the NSF website.  To make these tools more accessible as well as to create a basic understanding of their function for minority-serving institutions and non-traditional NSF awardee organizations the Policy Office will create a CD-ROM, or “electronic suite” of relevant guidance, documents, and available outreach. While the ultimate goal will be to produce materials that are representative of the totality of public interaction undertaken by the Office of Budget, Finance and Award Management, this first-generation project intends to focus specifically on NSF's major policy and procedural documents related to the proposal and award process. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government or as a Request for Proposal.  No contract will be awarded resultant of this notice.  Oral communications and facsimile responses are not authorized. All questions must be submitted electronically to the National Science Foundation, Attn: Jillian Pate, Contract Specialist, Division of Contracts and Complex Agreements, at jpate@nsf.gov. The anticipated contract start date will be the first part of November 2005.  The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about September 2, 2005 with an anticipated offer due date on or about September 15, 2005.

The solicitation cited above can only be obtained by accessing a secure website known as the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOpps and the Central Contract Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  In order to obtain information from FedTeDS, you will first be required to register with CCR.  The Central Contractor Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity.  Effective October, 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  You may access CCR at the following URL www.bpn.gov.   Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following URL http://www.FedTeDS.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled “Register with FedTeDS” and then choosing the “Vendor Registration Form” hyperlink.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  (Your Company’s Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Company’s, CCR Point of Contact) your Company’s DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), your telephone number, and your e-mail address.  Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC intends to extend Contract NAS4-99030, Aircraft Logistics Support Services, for six (6) months. The incumbent contractor, Kay and Associates, Inc. currently provides maintenance, modification, and support services for approximately 1200 pieces of Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE). Associated services provided include Shuttle mission staffing, operation and maintenance of Shuttle Support Equipment; training of personnel on special purpose vehicles and flight line driving; maintenance of GSA, utility, and NASA owned vehicles; and technical liaison services. NASA/DFRC intends to procure these services from Kay and Associates, Inc. of Buffalo Grove, Illinois. The authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements”. A separate competitive follow-on procurement is being conducted at this time however it will not be completed in time to prevent a lapse in service. A lapse in the services provided by this contract would prevent DFRC from completing its mission. The services include the maintenance and upgrade of unique aircraft ground support items and special-purpose NASA-owned vehicles not normally found in non-research flight operations. The incumbent is in possession of the requisite knowledge, skills, and experience required, which will ensure continuous services during the interim extension period. Award to any other source would result in failure to meet the Agency's requirements. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This is an announcement of a Request for Information (RFI).    This RFI is issued for the purpose of identifying potential sources capable of demonstrating commercial off the shelf (COTS) products with capabilities that support the transformation and viewing of Air Force Technical Electronic Manuals (ETMs)/Technical Orders (TOs).  These products must have a viable commercial presence in industry and should be in current use in applications similar to the Air Force use. This is not a solicitation.  This is a market survey.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not reimburse any costs for providing any information, documentation, and/or data submitted or preparation costs for submittals in response to this RFI.  In addition, the Government will not pay for any costs associated with participation in demonstrations. BACKGROUND INFORMATION: The Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) Program is researching capabilities available through commercial products, learning about industry-leading vendors, and exploring how commercial products accomplish AF TO translation and viewing capability scenarios.  The purpose of this RFI is to evaluate products that can support TO translation and viewing on the Air Force Portal as well as in disconnected mode. The Enterprise TO solution should allow effective and consistent viewing of TOs that were created and stored in multiple formats (e.g., Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Portable Document Format (PDF), and XML). POC: GCSS-AF Vendor Product Liaison, Dr. Will Tracz  (607) 741-2666 GCSS-AF SPO, 1Lt Joseph Whitmore (781)377-6076 See attachments for more details about this request for information.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the German-Dutch Wind Tunnels (DNW), Emmeloord, Netherlands for wind tunnel testing and support for the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye (AHE) program.  This effort will include the procurement of wind tunnel testing services and support of a powered propeller driven E-2D 1/7 scale model and its propeller system.  The proposed efforts require model duct calibration, isolated propeller testing and scale model wind tunnel testing of a 1/7 scale E-2D Advanced Hawkeye model.  The model is powered with compressed-air motors and is currently being manufactured by DNW via a subcontract with Northrop Grumman Corportation (NGC) under Contract N00019-03-C-0057, the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye Sytem Development and Demonstration (SD&D) contract.  Testing will require model maintenance support and technicians to support model changes.  Key Wind Tunnel Test objectives include attaining six-degree-of-freedom (6 DOF) force and moment data for stability and control, and performance for both the model aircraft and the propeller system, including slipstream/power effects.  The technical requirements for this wind tunnel testing effort include:  a wind tunnel of sufficient size and facilities capable of testing a model with a wing span of 11.42 ft (3.48 m) while maintaining a wing-span-to-tunnel-width ratio of no greater than 80% and blockage less than 5%; providing no less than 90 bar air-supply pressure and 80 kW power to the air motor's inlet; airflow velocities of no less than 0.4 Mach; Reynolds number (based on blade chord of approximately 11 inches (28cm)) at the 70% propeller blade radius of at least 0.5 x10^5; and test personnel with demonstrated expertise and recent previous experience with powered testing of turboprop aircraft to obtain stability, control and performance data.  DNW is the only contractor that has the requisite knowledge, facilities, and equipment to provide the technical support for the E-2D AHE model and execute the wind tunnel testing requirements without substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements.  This synopsis is for information purposes only.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Government intends to purchase services to assist The Navy Environmental Health Center to understand the health effects for emerging chemicals.  The Navy Environmental Health Center is continuously tasked with responding to issues involving materials of evolving regulatory interest (MERIT).  DoD has been working along side EPA, and other agencies and stakeholders. As they are identified, Navy needs to ensure that research needs and approaches for addressing health concerns are conducted in an environmentally sound manner and meet or are better than existing regulatory requirements.  In some cases, current information regarding toxicology and fate and transport is very limited or nonexistent.

MERIT chemicals may include polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perchlorate, nitrosamines, chlorinated pesticides and munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) and/or their potential environmental break down products.  MEC include ingredients in solid propellant mixtures used for rockets, missiles, and munitions, various caliber, exploding and unexploded (potentially discarded) ordnance, smoke and pyrotechnics, test kits, particulates, energetic materials, carbonyls/ aldehydes, dioxins and furans, various gases (for example, hydrogen cyanide, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, etc.), chemical agents (such as GB, VX, and mustard gas), explosives, heavy metals, such as tungsten, depleted uranium, and lead, ammonium picrate, nitroglycerine, nitrocellulose, HMX, RDX, TNT, black powder, ammonium nitrate fuel oil, etc.

Tasks

The support includes but is not limited to:
·	Conduct rigorous scientific research/review of the literature and other information to identify specific toxicological data needed to make a scientifically sound determination and provide timely and accurate comments.  The literature review should include USEPA and California EPA sources because they may have already evaluated the chemical and developed regulatory applicable reference doses or cancer slope factors.  The literature review should also include the general toxicological scientific literature; 
·	Prepare and provide toxicity profiles to NEHC for chemicals that NEHC identifies.  The toxicity profiles generally should not be longer than 3 pages and should focus on the topics identified in the outline below as information is available, including:
o	Assess the scientific validity of available data, data needs and data gaps
o	Verify that the key studies underlying the health assessment are of the quality, reliability, and relevance required drawing conclusions about the health implications of exposure to low levels of specific chemical in drinking water.
o	Interpret and summarize the key toxicology issues and help determine the validity of the scientific findings presented.
o	Identify populations at risk of increased susceptibility/disease outcomes.
o	Derive toxicity values for these MERIT and/or U.S. EPA proposed UCMR2 new list of chemicals.  
o	Prepare a chart of appropriate toxicity values for each chemical;
·	Prepare briefing materials, Power Point slides, and handouts to present in support of technical meetings; 
·	Determine whether to recommend that the Navy agree or disagree with the Federal, EPA Regional, and/or State regulators toxicology conclusions and outline the reasons.  
·	Provide specific toxicity information, as applicable, for each chemical concerning the disruption of function in humans and animals at various stages of life.  These efforts may help to prevent regulatory bodies from issuing overly conservative drinking water maximum contaminant level (MCL) that would create an unjustified heightened sense of concern in the public and needlessly waste tax payers money in cleanup costs.
·	Review the toxicological and epidemiological research, health studies, and regulatory initiatives that will impact Navy sites
·	Review available body burden data and determine appropriate toxicity values to use for indoor air/VI pathways for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in calculating the human health risk
·	Participate in conference calls with NEHC and other parties to discuss toxicological or other information that may issues involved in the evaluation of VI sites.
·	Revise the toxicity profiles based on NEHC input and finalize.  
·	Provide NEHC (if requested) with a copy of all pertinent scientific papers and information.  

TOXICOLOGICAL PROFILES CONCEPTUAL OUTLINE
·	Chemical and Physical Information Relevant to Human Health Risk Assessments
·	Toxicokinetics relevant to Human Health Risk Assessments such as Gastrointestinal, Respiratory Tract, and dermal absorption.
·	Hazard Identification 
o	Studies in Humans – Epidemiology and Case Reports for oral, inhalation and dermal exposure.
o	Subchronic and Chronic Studies and Cancer Bioassays in Animals
o	Reproductive/Developmental Studies
o	Other Studies 
o	Weight-of-evidence Evaluation and Cancer Characterization
o	Susceptible Populations
o	Dose-Response
§	Oral reference dose (RfD) basis
§	Inhalation RfC basis
§	Dermal RfD basis
§	Oral Slope Factor
§	Inhalation Slope Factor
§	Dermal Slope Factor
·	Summary and Conclusions
·	References

The contractor shall provide the following deliverables:

1.	Toxicological Profiles for 40 chemicals including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perchlorate, nitrosamines, chlorinated pesticides and munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) and/or their potential environmental break down products following the above outline.  
2.	Responses to Regulatory Comments regarding the development of toxicological profiles for each chemical in MERIT.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) plans to contract on a sole source basis with Guoping Wu, 1 Yuhuinan Rd, Beishihuandong Rd, Beijing 100029PR, China for: Smoky Coal Exposure Assessment.   The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541620 and the business size standard is $6M.  Background: The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics will carry out a smoky coal exposure assessment study in two regions (e.g. Xuan Wei and Fu Yuan counties). Smoky coal exposure has been identified as one of the most important risk factors for lung cancer. As such there is an interest in both quantitative and qualitative data to better understand the observed risks for lung cancer. The highest risk for lung cancer due to smoky coal exposure has been described in China in Xuan Wei and Fu Yuan counties.  This exposure study is intended to be an extension of previous research that has been performed by the China National Environmental Monitoring Center of the Chinese Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) in this area in China. It is important that the previous data and the newly collected exposure data are comparable as it is intended to combine and compare the two sets of data. Furthermore, China National Environmental Monitoring Center of the Chinese Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) is the only governmental administration in China that is authorized to collect environmental surveillance information and assess environmental quality nationwide. Dr. Wu is a senior investigator in CNEMC and an expert in the field of research of environmental evaluation and environmental-related diseases with more than 20 years of experiences. Xuan Wei has the highest lung cancer rate in China, primarily driven by Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) exposure derived from smoky coal emissions. Thus this region constitutes a unique natural experiment that is one of the best opportunities in the world to study smoky coal exposure.  Period of Performance:   one year from date of issuance.  This is a notice of intent not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.

<SUBJECT>59 -- Supply Chain Management - Tobyhanna Army Depot
<SOLNBR>SP0500-05-R-0087
<CONTACT>Kim Nichols, Contracting Officer , Phone 215-737-2437, Fax 215-737-5586, Email kim.nichols@dla.mil
<DESC>This program provides total supply chain management in support of consumables used in maintenance, repair & overhaul of Army weapon systems.  The contractor will employ a combination of commercial & DLA sources of supply in the performance of logistics support.  The contract will also include provisions in support of worldwide demand (WWD) requirements for selected items; just-in-time support; & at least a 98% fill rate for all schedule of item requirements. The IPV contractor will employ a supplier/manufacturer network with the resources, finances & supply chain management capability to support planned & unanticipated requirements.  The logistics solutions will integrate the various sources of supply, thereby achieving robust competition at the supplier level, while still providing seamless interface with DLA & the Army customer.  This sophisticated logistics solution requires a continuous open exchange of information between customer, supplier network & DLA.  A seamless logistics system with state-of-the-art information technology (IT) & assured communications is essential for optimum support & total asset visibility.  This solicitation's customer base is the Tobyhanna Army Depot in Pennsylvania.  The contract scope includes approximately 27,000 National Stock Numbers (NSNs) with a total estimated annual value of $15,000,000.00.  The market basket shall consist of commercially sourced items which represent the profile of commercially sourced items for the contract term and are a subpopulation of the schedule of items.  Some items will be designated WWD & some will be designated site specific.  Unanticipated, non-repetitive requirements will be supported by spot-buys which are acquisitions based on customer urgency.  For each NSN on the market basket and the subsequent contract, offerors are required to provide a unit price & a total price for each NSN, a material management price and a grand total evaluated price (Note: All estimated prices are fully burdened to include material cost, profit & F.O.B. destination).  It is the Government's intent to issue an Indefinite Quantity, Fixed-Priced with EPA contract.  The solicitation will contain a 3-year base period with one (1) 3-year option and two (2) 2-year options.  The solicitation will utilize 'best value source selection' procedures.  The government will consider other factors in addition to price when evaluating proposals to determine the best overall expected value.  Technical merit is considered significantly more important than price.  The evaluation factors will be Technical Merit; Past Performance; Socio-Economic Consideration; Javits-Wagner-O'Day considerations & DLA Mentoring Businesses Agreement Program.  Just-in-time deliveries to the customer sites (not the World Wide demand requirements) will be required.  Offerors will be required to submit a delivery schedule for each of the items that are designated as having WWD quantities listed in the Market Basket.  Note: Deliveries may vary among items; these deliveries are for the WWD portion (not the site demand).  The Trade Agreement Act applies to all items except those in FSG 95. The deadline for receipt of proposals will be forty-five (45) days from the solicitation issue date.  DSCP plans on conducting site visits within two weeks after the solicitation issue date.  The Schedule-of-Items and the Market Basket can be obtained, WHEN THE SOLICITATION IS ISSUED, by accessing the DSCP website at www.dscp.dla.mil/gi/general/ipvsites.html.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Christopher Heim, 508 233 6328
<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM - Natick Contracting Division, in support of the US Army Soldier Systems Center-Natick identified a requirement for Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment, also known as MOLLE.  MOLLE is replacing the All-Purpose Lightweight   Individual Carrying Equipment (ALICE) for general use by the U.S. Army.  The Government will provide a Technical Data Package, that will consist of the following primary components: Core Rifleman`s Set (NSN: 8465-01-525-0578, maximum quantity 899,492), P istol Set (NSN: 8465-01-524-7328, max quantity of 179,900), Grenadier Set (NSN: 8465-01-524-7624, max quantity of 89,948)), SAW Gunner Set (NSN: 8465-01-524-7362, max quantity of 89,948), Medic Set (NSN: 8465-01-524-7632, max quantity of 35,980), Large Fie ld Pack Set (NSN: 8465-01-523-6276, max quantity of 899,492), and a series of modular pouches to be mounted on the outer tactical vest, FLC, and/or rucksack or assault pack.  MOLLE provides a better, more modular way to carry loads, therefore improving com fort and increasing user acceptance.  MOLLE is compatible with all individual Soldier tactics, techniques, procedures, and individual equipment and is durable enough to withstand foreseeable use and misuse in diverse military operational environments.  The  Government anticipates that this requirement will be a thirty (30) percent Small Business Set-Aside, with the other seventy (70) percent being a Full and Open Competitive acquisition, however, the Government reserves the right to change the solicitation p rocedure. Firms shall not be reimbursed for any costs associated with proposals.  The Government envisions one award under the Small Business Set-Aside portion and up to two awards under the Full and Open Competition portion of which Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP)  Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts would be awarded as a result of the Request for Proposals (RFP). However the government reserves the right to award one contract or none. The Government anticipates the total length of contract(s) t o be five (5) years. If more than one contract is awarded the requirements will be divided (ratio to de determined) among successful offerors. Offerors are to note that National Industry for the Severly Handicap (NISH) is currently the mandatory source for  various components associated with the MOLLE. When released, the solicitation, including all amendments, and applicable documents (with the exception of patterns, if applicable) will only be available in electronic medium at the US Army RDECOM  Natick Co ntracting website at https://www3.natick.army.mil .  The point of contact for this is Chris Heim and can be contacted via email at christopher.andrew.heim@natick.army.mil

Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following URL http://www.FedTeDS.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled “Register with FedTeDS” and then choosing the “Vendor Registration Form” hyperlink.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  (Your Company’s Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Company’s, CCR Point of Contact) your Company’s DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), your telephone number, and your e-mail address.  Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation.

<DESC>Modification to submission posted on FedBizOpps on May 10, 2005 is modified as follows:

Quotes are due June 7, 2005.  

The Economic Price Adjustment clause is replaced in its entirety by the following:  Contract rates will be adjusted annually, when the contract is renewed, in accordance with the following to reflect increase or decreases in the cost of performance of the contract work.  Adjustments of rates will be based on changes in the folloiwng price indices:  (a) The Average of: (1) The Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Priced Index for all urban consumers (all items).  (2) The Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (all items).  The newly adjusted rates will become effective annually upon renewal of the contract.  The new rates will reflect the changes in the indices over the 12 calendar month period ending 45 days immediately prior to the annual adjustment.  The rates will be derived by multiplying the average percentage change in the indices times the current contract rate.  The result will be added to or subtracted from the contract rates to become the newly adjusted rates.  The rates (rounded to the next dollar)to be adjusted as indicated herein are:  All hourly priced rates listed in the Schedule of Items.

ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT – STATE WORKER’S COMPENSATION INSURANCE

Contract unit prices may be adjusted at the time an option is exercised, to reflect general increases or decreases in State Worker’s Compensation insurance rates for the categories of labor applicable to this contract.  The Contractor shall submit a current statement showing rates charged per $100 gross payroll to the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days after receipt of a written request.  Adjustments will be limited to increases or decreases in the general rates only, exclusive of any modifier applicable to an individual Contractor and shall not include any amount for general and administrative cost, profit, or overhead.

Example:

Unit Price = $300.00
Percent of Unit Price Affected (wages, excluding payroll taxes) = 50%
Percent increase in Worker’s Compensation Rate = New rate per $100 gross payroll ($48.00) – Previous rate per $100 gross payroll ($40.00)


$300 X $48.00 - $40.00 X .50
	         100		= $12.00			New Unit Price = $312.00

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Patuxent River, MD is seeking information for potential sources regarding industry technologies applicable to reduce heat stress associated with current anti-G suit and limit anti-G bladder expansion away from the pilot.  This request is for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. 

CURRENT TECHNOLOGY: Current anti-G suits employ 1.7 oz polyurethane-coated nylon bladders, welded flat that inflate to round shapes. These bladders are encased in a sewn and bound 4.3oz aramid shell that is cut slightly smaller than the bladder shape to offload the bladder welds.  
The mechanism of protection is that of direct compression on the vascular tissue below the bladder as well as hoop compression around the body as the surrounding fabric casing tightens to in response to bladder inflation.
The anti-G suit is currently worn over the top of a flight coverall, dry suit, and undergarments.  In the past, the anti-G suit was worn over undergarments but underneath the dry suit and flight coverall. However, its inflation height (thus level of protection) was hampered by the size of the outer garments. Rather than increase the bulk of the outer garments to accommodate the anti-G suit, the anti-G suit was made flame resistant and moved to the outermost layer, and designed to reduce the bulk of the outer garments.  

DEFICIENCIES OF CURRENT BLADDER TECHNOLOGY:  
1) The anti-G suit bladders cover most of the surface area below the waist with impermeable bladders, which also increase thermal load.
2) The anti-G suit bladders are made of flammable, meltable materials, and must be encased within a flame resistant shell.
3) The “football” shape of anti-G suit bladders seem to apply inefficient point compression to tissue, and thus requires large inflated diameters to effect venous return.
4) The anti-G suit weighs up to 6 lbs, and impacts the overall aircrew physical workload.
5) The polyurethane coated nylon fabric is sticky on its coated face, and requires a spacer fabric to prevent kinking.
6) In the current anti-G suit design, if the bladder is damaged the entire suit must be disposed of because access to the bladders is very difficult and attempts to repair the bladder may result in additional damage.
7) The skill level to repair anti-G suits is high – inexperienced sewing machine operators can inadvertently “run over” the bladder, and ruin the asset. Thus no bladder repairs are allowed.
8) The bladder design requires die cutting and die-welding which have expensive initial set-up tooling costs.
9) The polyurethane coated nylon is relatively stiff for its weight, and restricts wearer mobility.
10) The polyurethane coated nylon is noisy when it is moved – a deficiency in a survival/evasion situation.
11) The compression of the coverall, dry suit, and undergarments underneath the anti-G suit restricts mobility, but also creates pressure points from folds 

The applicant must demonstrate the capability to:
1) Reduce the weight, thickness, and stiffness of bladder layer 
2) Employ a channel bladder system rather than the current football to distribute pressure more evenly around body, and to reduce the inflated profile overall
3) Incorporate traditional capstan in conjunction with bladder channels
4) Incorporate holes between bladders where possible to allow heat to escape and any external ventilation air to pass through the suit towards the skin

PROGRAM GOALS:
1) Demonstrate that new bladders can exert necessary vascular compression 
2) Demonstrate that inflated profile is reduced
3) Demonstrate that bladder inflation/deflation occurs as rapidly as current 
4) Demonstrate that an anti-G suit with new bladders is lighter and less bulky 
5) Demonstrate that an anti-G suit with new bladders is more “breathable” – allows more ventilation
6) Demonstrate that the anti-G suit with new bladders provides commensurate G-protection in centrifuge
7) Demonstrate that the anti-G suit with new bladders reduces skin temperature and body core temperature of wearer compared to current

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Patuxent River, MD is seeking information for potential sources regarding industry technologies applicable to reduce heat stress associated with current anti-G suit and limit anti-G bladder expansion away from the pilot.  This request is for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. 

CURRENT TECHNOLOGY: Current anti-G suits employ 1.7 oz polyurethane-coated nylon bladders, welded flat that inflate to round shapes. These bladders are encased in a sewn and bound 4.3oz aramid shell that is cut slightly smaller than the bladder shape to offload the bladder welds.  
The mechanism of protection is that of direct compression on the vascular tissue below the bladder as well as hoop compression around the body as the surrounding fabric casing tightens to in response to bladder inflation.
The anti-G suit is currently worn over the top of a flight coverall, dry suit, and undergarments.  In the past, the anti-G suit was worn over undergarments but underneath the dry suit and flight coverall. However, its inflation height (thus level of protection) was hampered by the size of the outer garments. Rather than increase the bulk of the outer garments to accommodate the anti-G suit, the anti-G suit was made flame resistant and moved to the outermost layer, and designed to reduce the bulk of the outer garments.  

DEFICIENCIES OF CURRENT BLADDER TECHNOLOGY:  
1) The anti-G suit bladders cover most of the surface area below the waist with impermeable bladders, which also increase thermal load.
2) The anti-G suit bladders are made of flammable, meltable materials, and must be encased within a flame resistant shell.
3) The “football” shape of anti-G suit bladders seem to apply inefficient point compression to tissue, and thus requires large inflated diameters to effect venous return.
4) The anti-G suit weighs up to 6 lbs, and impacts the overall aircrew physical workload.
5) The polyurethane coated nylon fabric is sticky on its coated face, and requires a spacer fabric to prevent kinking.
6) In the current anti-G suit design, if the bladder is damaged the entire suit must be disposed of because access to the bladders is very difficult and attempts to repair the bladder may result in additional damage.
7) The skill level to repair anti-G suits is high – inexperienced sewing machine operators can inadvertently “run over” the bladder, and ruin the asset. Thus no bladder repairs are allowed.
8) The bladder design requires die cutting and die-welding which have expensive initial set-up tooling costs.
9) The polyurethane coated nylon is relatively stiff for its weight, and restricts wearer mobility.
10) The polyurethane coated nylon is noisy when it is moved – a deficiency in a survival/evasion situation.
11) The compression of the coverall, dry suit, and undergarments underneath the anti-G suit restricts mobility, but also creates pressure points from folds 

The applicant must demonstrate the capability to:
1) Reduce the weight, thickness, and stiffness of bladder layer 
2) Employ a channel bladder system rather than the current football to distribute pressure more evenly around body, and to reduce the inflated profile overall
3) Incorporate traditional capstan in conjunction with bladder channels
4) Incorporate holes between bladders where possible to allow heat to escape and any external ventilation air to pass through the suit towards the skin

PROGRAM GOALS:
1) Demonstrate that new bladders can exert necessary vascular compression 
2) Demonstrate that inflated profile is reduced
3) Demonstrate that bladder inflation/deflation occurs as rapidly as current 
4) Demonstrate that an anti-G suit with new bladders is lighter and less bulky 
5) Demonstrate that an anti-G suit with new bladders is more “breathable” – allows more ventilation
6) Demonstrate that the anti-G suit with new bladders provides commensurate G-protection in centrifuge
7) Demonstrate that the anti-G suit with new bladders reduces skin temperature and body core temperature of wearer compared to current
Note that demonstrations in centrifuge and on human subjects will be performed by NAWCAD.  
Note that demonstrations 1-3 shall include testing on human volunteers.

The Government is interested in the following criteria: (a) technical and scientific merit; (b) offer’s ability to demonstrate/execute feasibility; (c) offer’s existing capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of the above that will enable the vendor to achieve the intended objective; (d) ability to demonstrate and execute cost savings alternatives.

<SUBJECT>B -- UAV Battlelab Dynamic Spectrum Management and Allocation Tool Broad Agency Announcement FY05
<SOLNBR>BAA-UAVB-05-004
<RESPDATE>090905
<ARCHDATE>09092005
<CONTACT>David Huber, Contracting Officer, Phone 702-652-3366, Fax 702-652-3367, Email david.huber@nellis.af.mil - Micah O'Neal, Contract Specialist, Phone 702-652-5401, Fax 702-652-3367, Email micah.oneal@nellis.af.mil
<DESC>A.         THIS IS A BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA UAVB 05-0003) FOR UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE DYNAMIC SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT AND ALLOCATION TOOL CAPABILITY.

B.         INTRODUCTION 

A software-based tool is needed to assist in frequency management and coordination in a dynamic environment.  As Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) proliferate the battlespace, lack of available spectrum is becoming a critical issue.  The traditional way that Joint-level spectrum managers allocate and deconflict frequency assignments is largely a static process and inefficient.  A dynamic process is needed to allow the sharing and re-use of frequencies on a mission-by-mission, day-by-day basis, e.g., through an ATO-like process.  Rather than have spectrum assigned "permanently" to (and owned by) a particular unit, units should receive frequencies as needed based on the specific requirements for a given mission.  The spectrum resources should be managed/controlled/coordinated in a similar manner as that which currently exists for managing the airspace.  The system needs to be flexible enough to factor in mission locations, en-route/egress flight paths, mission altitudes, TX range requirements, frequency congestion areas, etc.  If an RPA unit stands down for WX outage, the frequency bandwidth they normally need should be available for use by other RPA platforms.   When the RPA is on-station over the target area, the frequencies needed during takeoff at the FOL 300 miles away should be temporarily marked as available for other users. The UAV Battlelab is interested in any systems that would be able to perform this dynamic spectrum management and allocation function. 


C.         OBJECTIVE

(1) Technical Description: 

The proposed concept will be based on the demonstration of a MATURE TECHNOLOGY.

All responses to this BAA will be evaluated for applicability to the aforementioned need.         


D.         ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Potential offerors are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number and reference number BAA UAVB 05-0003 with their submissions.  Potential offerors are required to register their company information at www.ccr.gov before any contracts can be awarded to that company.     Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to apply.

E.         CONCEPT PAPER PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS 

The cost of preparing concept papers in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost IAW FAR 31.205-18.     Every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the concept paper and any evaluations.     The submitter must mark the concept paper with a protective legend IAW FAR 3.104-5.    Offerors are strongly encouraged to submit concept papers, not to exceed five (5) pages, to the electronic addresses listed in section A of this announcement.     However, if you do not have the capability of transmitting the concept paper electronically, submit three (3) copies, not to exceed 5 pages, of the proposed concept to Mrs. Briggs at the address in Section A of this BAA.     The concept paper shall be formatted as follows: 

Section A: Title, Submitter, Date, E-Mail Account, Phone#, Fax #, Organization/Office Symbol, Address, Period of Performance, Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost of effort. 

Section B: Proposed Solution summarizing the system.

Section C: Identify similar contracts to include the point of contacts current telephone # and address.     For papers marked proprietary, the offeror shall submit a non-proprietary title and summary, not to exceed one (1) additional page.

Those solutions found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA and of interest to the Government may be invited to submit a complete technical and price proposal.  AN INVITATION BASED UPON A SUBMITTED CONCEPT PAPER DOES NOT ENSURE THE OFFEROR WILL BE AWARDED A SUBSEQUENT CONTRACT. 

F.         BASIS FOR AWARD

(1) Concept papers will be evaluated as they are received based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other concepts submitted under this announcement.  Concept papers will be evaluated under the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: 

(a) Technical merit of the proposed concept.

(b) Proposed cost.     

(c) Maturity of technology.

All three areas, (a) through (c), will be evaluated at the same time during the evaluation process.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the concept papers.

(2) Anticipated Period of Performance: Average duration of demonstrations will be up to 15 months from time of award through complete evaluation and demonstration of the operational concept.  However, some initiatives may require more resources depending on complexity of the concept.  Type of contract(s) expected: Firm-Fixed Price (Unless another contract type is determined by the contracting officer to be more appropriate).  Primary appropriation type: Operations and Maintenance.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice:

The AFFTC, 412 Test Wing (412TW/EWBC), Edwards Air Force Base, CA is seeking potential sources capable of providing and testing Microwave Pyrmidal Flame-Retardant Foam Absorbers in accordance with the following Statement of Work:
STATEMENT OF WORK FOR MICROWAVE PYRMIDAL FLAME-RETARDANT ABSORBERS. 1.0 SCOPE: The Electronic Warfare Directorate has a requirement to provide low frequency test capability in the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF).  This low frequency capability requires the installation of foam absorbers in order to eliminate multi-path reflections back to the System Under Test (SUT).  The purchase of 1,680 EACH 72” foam absorbers and 36 EACH 24” foam absorbers is needed to provide the necessary attenuation at these frequencies. 2.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS IEEE STANDARD 1128 –“Recommended Practice for RF Absorber Performance Evaluation in the Range 30 MHz to 5Ghz”. NRL Report 8093 – “Modified Smoldering Test of Urethane Foams Used in Anechoic Chambers”. 
3.0 REQUIREMENTS:  3.1 Testing. Each piece of absorber shall be uniquely numbered and tested.  Low frequency testing can be performed done using a coaxial reflectometer according to IEEE Standard 1128.  The IEEE low frequency method requires absorber to be tested eight pieces at a time, which is acceptable to verify the low frequency performance.  The absorber must be tested from 80Mhz to 500Mhz and meet or exceed (more negative) the reflection values in the chart below: (See break points on tale below.) The break points are listed in the table below: Frequency (MHz) Reflections at Normal Incidence (dB) 80 -20, 120 – 30, 200 – 40, 300 – 40, 500 – 45. 3.2 Manufacturing and Delivery Constraints. Each 2-ft by 2-ft absorber piece must be made out of a single piece of polyurethane foam. Due to the multiuse test nature of the BAF, glue lines would interfere with high frequency testing.  To ensure size and performance uniformity the polyurethane foam blocks must be carbon loaded prior to cutting.  Separately dipping the carbon loading from the fire retardant loading must be done to ensure more precise control of the carbon loading and hence the absorber’s final performance. The manufacturing and shipping of the absorber must be coordinated with the BAF test schedule.  At this point in time, delivery must be scheduled to begin during the week of 28 Nov – 2 Dec 2005. The BAF does not have storage resources to store the large volume of absorber and would like to install the absorber over an approximate 1 to 2-week delivery schedule.  The manufacturer must have a sufficiently large production capacity and indoor storage to be able to deliver the entire order in as short as a 1 week window for timely deployment in the BAF.  The last delivery of the entire order cannot exceed 2 weeks from the first delivery. 3.3 Fire Retardant.
Independently test the flammability of the absorber’s manufacturing method to meet the NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3).  3.4 Physical Characteristics for RAM:  “A low frequency test area design requires larger Radar Absorbing Material (RAM) in order to eliminate multi-path reflections from the floor to the test zone.   a. Implementation of the 72” RAM on the BAF chamber floor requires it to be tilted at various angles in order to obtain an attenuation of at least 20 dB at 100MHz.  In order to accurately tilt the 72” RAM and provide the greatest layout flexibility, three separate RAM wedge angles are needed, 45°, 30°, and 15°.  Each wedge type should be color coded to provide easy identification.  Velcro with suitable strength will be attached to each wedge and single piece of 72” pyramidal RAM.  The wedges will be loaded with the same carbon solution density as the 72” pyramidal RAM.  In addition, special RAM pieces needed for the specular region of the RAM layout will be required.  These pieces are made by using a special 2’x2’x2’ cube with the same carbon solution density as the 72” pyramidal RAM.  They will fit in the area where the 72” pyramidal RAM is titled at 45° and pointing in opposite directions.  The cubes will be made with Velcro on two adjoining surfaces so that two 24” pyramidal RAM pieces can be attached to them.  The total number of cubes needed for the specular region is 36 each.  The total number of 24” pyramidal RAM is 36 each. 	b.  Each piece of absorber shall be uniquely numbered and tested.  Low frequency testing can be performed using a coaxial reflectometer according to IEEE Standard 1128.  The IEEE low frequency method requires absorber to be tested eight pieces at a time, which is acceptable to verify the low frequency performance.  The absorber must be tested from 80 MHz to 500 MHz and meet or exceed (more negative) the reflection values table cited above: High frequency reflectivity measurements are required on 10% of the full lot of 72” pyramidal RAM.  The frequency band for this measurement is from 6 to 18 GHz at near normal incident angle.  Test samples will be taken from sub-lots throughout the manufacture run and are deliverable (A001). c. Each 2-ft by 2-ft absorber piece must be made out of a single piece of polyurethane foam. Due to the multiuse test nature of the BAF, glue lines would interfere with high frequency testing.  To ensure size and performance uniformity the polyurethane foam blocks must be carbon loaded prior to cutting.  Separately dipping the carbon loading from the fire retardant loading must be done to ensure more precise control of the carbon loading and hence the absorber’s final performance.  d. Independently test the flammability of the absorber’s manufacturing method to meet the NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3).  
e. Note: The physical characteristics of the 72” RAM: * Standard carbon loading is 1.1 lbs/ft3, further modeling by the manufacturer may show that a lighter loading will give better performance in the BAF setup.  The manufacturer must be equipped to vary the loading of the absorber at the time of manufacturing with no additional cost.  Various carbon loadings may be specified by the government for different lots.  No more then 3 lots are anticipated for the total order.
3.5 Past Performance Requirements. Provide evidence of previous contract success in meeting identical or similar requirements: 
a.	RAM manufactured to specification (SOW Para 3.2, 3.3 & 3.4)
b.	Meeting flammability testing requirements IAW NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3) as spelled out in the BAF safety document (SOW Para 3.3)
c.	Delivery similar quantity of RAM within the narrow time frame (SOW Para 3.2).

3.6 Program Management. The contractor shall notify the AFFTC Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) in a timely manner concerning any issues that would adversely impact the contractor’s ability to meet and satisfy the performance and schedule requirements of this SOW.

Please note that this synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for competitive bids/proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements for providing and testing Microwave Pyrmidal Flame-Retardant Foam Absorbers are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide listed above.

<DESC>The Intelligent Systems Division (ISD) of the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory (MEL) at of the U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a mission to develop the measurements and standards infrastructure needed for the application of intelligent systems by manufacturing industries and Government agencies.   ISD is being funded by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop performance standards and test methods for homeland security robots.   These two projects focus on standards for two main types of robot applications, respectively:

(1)  bomb disposal (also known as explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) in the military)

(2)  urban search and rescue (US&R)

ISD is designing and implementing extensive test suites for both types of robots, which will be proposed as standard test methods.  No such unambiguous measures of the performance of robots currently exist.  In order to help in the design, execution, and refinement of the tests being developed, ISD requires having one or more robots to exercise the tests.  Although the application domains are different, there is significant overlap in the capabilities required for the robots and we intend to leverage this as much as possible.

ISD is designing and implementing extensive test suites for bomb disposal and urban search and rescue robots, which will be proposed as standard test methods.  In order to do so, ISD requires access to specific commercial robots for devising, refining, and validating the tests.  The performance characteristics specified below are based on initial requirements defined in conjunction with the intended end-users of the robots (bomb squad members, military EOD responders, and emergency responders). 

The NIST Acquisition Management Division (AMD), on behalf of ISD, currently seeks to purchase one Foster-Miller Inc. Talon EOD robot specifically for testing and evaluating this robot¡¦s capabilities and performance per the NIJ and DHS Standards being developed.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Patuxent River, MD is seeking information for potential sources regarding industry technologies applicable to reduce heat stress associated with current anti-G suit and limit anti-G bladder expansion away from the pilot.  This request is for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. 

CURRENT TECHNOLOGY: Current anti-G suits employ 1.7 oz polyurethane-coated nylon bladders, welded flat that inflate to round shapes. These bladders are encased in a sewn and bound 4.3oz aramid shell that is cut slightly smaller than the bladder shape to offload the bladder welds.  
The mechanism of protection is that of direct compression on the vascular tissue below the bladder as well as hoop compression around the body as the surrounding fabric casing tightens to in response to bladder inflation.
The anti-G suit is currently worn over the top of a flight coverall, dry suit, and undergarments.  In the past, the anti-G suit was worn over undergarments but underneath the dry suit and flight coverall. However, its inflation height (thus level of protection) was hampered by the size of the outer garments. Rather than increase the bulk of the outer garments to accommodate the anti-G suit, the anti-G suit was made flame resistant and moved to the outermost layer, and designed to reduce the bulk of the outer garments.  

DEFICIENCIES OF CURRENT BLADDER TECHNOLOGY:  
1) The anti-G suit bladders cover most of the surface area below the waist with impermeable bladders, which also increase thermal load.
2) The anti-G suit bladders are made of flammable, meltable materials, and must be encased within a flame resistant shell.
3) The “football” shape of anti-G suit bladders seem to apply inefficient point compression to tissue, and thus requires large inflated diameters to effect venous return.
4) The anti-G suit weighs up to 6 lbs, and impacts the overall aircrew physical workload.
5) The polyurethane coated nylon fabric is sticky on its coated face, and requires a spacer fabric to prevent kinking.
6) In the current anti-G suit design, if the bladder is damaged the entire suit must be disposed of because access to the bladders is very difficult and attempts to repair the bladder may result in additional damage.
7) The skill level to repair anti-G suits is high – inexperienced sewing machine operators can inadvertently “run over” the bladder, and ruin the asset. Thus no bladder repairs are allowed.
8) The bladder design requires die cutting and die-welding which have expensive initial set-up tooling costs.
9) The polyurethane coated nylon is relatively stiff for its weight, and restricts wearer mobility.
10) The polyurethane coated nylon is noisy when it is moved – a deficiency in a survival/evasion situation.
11) The compression of the coverall, dry suit, and undergarments underneath the anti-G suit restricts mobility, but also creates pressure points from folds 

The applicant must demonstrate the capability to:
1) Reduce the weight, thickness, and stiffness of bladder layer 
2) Employ a channel bladder system rather than the current football to distribute pressure more evenly around body, and to reduce the inflated profile overall
3) Incorporate traditional capstan in conjunction with bladder channels
4) Incorporate holes between bladders where possible to allow heat to escape and any external ventilation air to pass through the suit towards the skin

PROGRAM GOALS:
1) Demonstrate that new bladders can exert necessary vascular compression 
2) Demonstrate that inflated profile is reduced
3) Demonstrate that bladder inflation/deflation occurs as rapidly as current 
4) Demonstrate that an anti-G suit with new bladders is lighter and less bulky 
5) Demonstrate that an anti-G suit with new bladders is more “breathable” – allows more ventilation
6) Demonstrate that the anti-G suit with new bladders provides commensurate G-protection in centrifuge
7) Demonstrate that the anti-G suit with new bladders reduces skin temperature and body core temperature of wearer compared to current
Note that demonstrations in centrifuge and on human subjects will be performed by NAWCAD.  Note that demonstrations 1-3 shall include testing on human volunteers.

Interested parties will be evaluated as they are received to determine the following merit criteria; (a) technical and scientific merit; (b) offer’s ability to demonstrate/execute feasibility; (c) offer’s existing capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of the above that will enable the vendor to achieve the intended objective; (d) ability to demonstrate and execute cost savings alternatives.  

The government is interested in written submittals of concepts and rough-order-of-magnitude cost estimates for the above. Companies responding to this request should provide detailed information on their capabilities and experience to DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND, AIRCRAFT SUPPORT CONTRACTS DEPARTMENT (Air 2.5.1.3), ATTN: Jessica McGee, Code 2.5.1.3.2.7, 21983 Bundy Road Unit 7 Bldg 441, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127. Written responses should be submitted by 19 April 2004 and reference this synopsis number on both the mailing envelope as well as on all enclosed documents.  Interested companies should indicate whether or not they are a small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), or large business.  Respondents must clarify if their firm can provide commercial or non-developmental items that could be modified, or the technology and expertise for development, to meet NAWCAD’s needs.  Please address all technical questions to Dr. Barry Shender, Code 4.1.4.1, (301) 342-8881.  Samples and 3-D models are encouraged.  Proprietary information MUST be marked as such, on a page-by-page basis.   This announcement is NOT a Request For Proposal nor does the Government intend to pay for any information/items submitted in response to this synopsis.  Data, samples and 3-D models WILL NOT be returned.  This synopsis does not commit the Government to award a contract.  This synopsis is for market research only and any procurement resulting from this announcement will be published separately on the Federal Bunisess Opportunities website.

     The NIH proposes to procure support staff to design, implement and maintain the infrastructure needed to conduct basic, applied and clinical research in accordance with the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12.  The NIH is soliciting offers to perform the statement of work below.
     
     
Statement of Work:

The National Institutes of Health consist of 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs) whose mission is to fund and conduct biomedical research. A cluster of these ICs are primarily interested in biomedical research involving the neurosciences. These ICs share a common need for research, development and research support services in order to support their neuroscience research mission.
The objective of this contract is to help provide the additional staffing necessary to help these ICs
fulfill their mission.

The ICs that this contract is designed to support are The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the
NIH Clinical Center (CC).

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) supports and conducts biomedical and behavioral research on the causes, consequences, treatment, and prevention of alcoholism and alcohol-related problems. NIAAA also provides leadership in the national effort to reduce the severe and often fatal consequences of these problems by: 
•	Conducting and supporting research directed at determining the causes of alcoholism, discovering how alcohol damages the organs of the body, and developing prevention and treatment strategies for application in the Nation's health care system; 
•	Supporting and conducting research across a wide range of scientific areas including genetics, neuroscience, medical consequences, medication development, prevention, and treatment through the award of grants and within the NIAAA's intramural research program; 
•	Conducting policy studies that have broad implications for alcohol problem prevention, treatment and rehabilitation activities; 
•	Conducting epidemiological studies such as national and community surveys to assess risks for and magnitude of alcohol-related problems among various population groups; 
•	Collaborating with other research institutes and Federal programs relevant to alcohol abuse and alcoholism, and providing coordination for Federal alcohol abuse and alcoholism research activities; 
•	Maintaining continuing relationships with institutions and professional associations; with international, national, state and local officials; and voluntary agencies and organizations engaged in alcohol-related work; and 
•	Disseminating research findings to health care providers, researchers, policymakers, and the public. 


National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is the nation's leading supporter of biomedical research on disorders of the brain and nervous system. NINDS needs to provide research services to support research at the NMR center. This will involve future development through gradual integration with existing systems as well as support for existing systems in continued optimized performance such that the progress of research is not impeded by various hardware/software problems and/or incompatibility with new application and systems for the NWR Center.

The Clinical Center (CC) is home to the National Institutes of Health intramural clinical research program. Located on the NIH Bethesda, Maryland campus, the Clinical Center complex is where clinical biomedical research occurs. The Clinical Center needs research support services to help facilitate research conducted by the Laboratory of Diagnostic Radiology Research. They need services to support scientific application programming and interfacing laboratory equipment to computer systems.

The purpose of this contract is to acquire the necessary research support services necessary to conduct basic and applied biomedical research in the areas image processing, neurophysiology, pharmacology, chemistry, genetics and to help conduct clinical protocols. The contract is needed to acquire the additional support staff necessary to design, implement and maintain the infrastructure needed to conduct basic, applied and clinical research. 

The development and expansion of systems used in biomedical research require a highly specialized scientific and technical staff. To reach our research and clinical objectives, we need to be able to acquire data from various sources, process and correct this data, analyze, interpret and present the results. This developmental work needs to have minimum impact on current research projects.

Because of FTE constraints, it is impossible to recruit a total Government employed technical staff capable of developing and expanding these research systems. The purpose of the requested contract is to obtain the scientific and technical support services needed to develop and expand systems used for medical image processing , neurophysiology, pharmacology, chemistry, genetics and to help conduct clinical protocols.

Terms and Conditions:
This shall be a fixed price contract for a period of one year and one option year.

The following technical evaluation criteria will be used in evaluating offers:
Evaluation Criteria:
The technical portion will receive paramount consideration in selecting a vendor.  Cost/price will be a significant factor if two or more vendors are determined to be equal following the evaluation of technical factors.

 Technical	
 Offerors are advised that award will be made to that offeror whose proposal provides the combination of features that offers the best or greatest overall value to the Government. The Government is more concerned with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than lowest overall cost.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance.  Overall cost to the Government may become the ultimate determining factor for award of a contract as proposals become more equal based on the other factors.  TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA ARE AS FOLLOWS:  The technical proposal will be evaluated on compliance with providing the specified items/services in Section B, and meeting the Statement of Work requirements specified in Section C and the Technical Evaluation Criteria.  The evaluation criteria are used by the technical evaluation committee when reviewing the technical proposals.  The criteria below are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes.

1.  Understanding the Performance Requirements				30 points

a) Provide a comprehensive statement of the scope and purpose of the project to demonstrate your complete understanding of the intent and requirements as outlined in Section C.  This understanding indicates a clear comprehension and awareness of the contract objectives.

Objectives:  State the overall objectives and the specific accomplishments you hope to achieve.   Indicate the rationale for your plan, and the relationship to comparable work in progress elsewhere. 

Approach: Use as many subparagraphs as needed to outline clearly the general plan of work that specifically addresses the services in Section C.
 
Methods: Describe in detail the methodologies you will use for the project, indicating your level of experience with each and any areas of anticipated difficulties. 

Schedule: Describe your onsite staff scheduling approach to the requirements to be performed during the business hours.  The contractor may propose alternate schedules such as staggering workday schedules to minimize overtime paid for weekend and holiday workers to develop more cost efficient methods for providing service.  

2.  Experience and Knowledge of Key Personnel			 	30 points

a)  Describe the technical capability and experience of all proposed key personnel. 

b)  Provide resumes of the proposed key personnel. 

c) Identify the key personnel and the hours they are expected to charge to this contract.  

d)  If a key person is currently not employed by the Offeror, his/her availability and commitment to this contract shall be documented in writing and signed by the proposed key person and an officer in the Offeror’s company. 

3.  Past Performance/Experience						20 points	

Evaluation of past performance/experience will be based on performance documentation or any other pertinent information available.  It will not be based solely on information provided by the offeror.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  NIH is seeking to determine whether an offeror has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to customer satisfaction and high performance of services.  This is a matter of judgment.  Failure to provide required information to assist in such evaluation in the proposal may result in disqualification.  The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offeror’s likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror’s record of past performance.  

4.  Ability to Deliver Timely Service						20 points	

a) Propose the method used to meet all time standards detailed in Section C, Statement of Work.

b) Provide an emergency response plan for unexpected requirements that must be serviced in a short period of time.

c) Contractors ability to recruit reliable, skilled and knowledgeable staff.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND
The Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) is a program developed by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find in a timely manner adequate staff to cover all positions in the field, in Washington and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  OFDA's Senior Management Team (SMT) approved a program which would bring on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters.  RATS positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.

INTRODUCTION

OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (OFDA/DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM employs sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (OFDA/PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OFDA/OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Support Program (DASP), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The RATS program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in the OFDA/OPS Division.  This team maintains a database for all contracted RATS, providing information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  The OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified RATS for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing RATS.  Each RATS incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

OBJECTIVES
The SMT has determined that OFDA needs to maintain a roster of 50 to 75 RATS to meet its surge capacity objectives.  Each incumbent will be deployable to backfill Washington positions, to field offices for staff enhancement, on DARTs and RMTs as disaster response demands, and for assessments of critical situations as warranted.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
RATS respond to humanitarian emergencies -- natural, technological and conflict-related disasters -- as required, worldwide.  The contractor may serve in the OFDA Washington offices as staff enhancement when critical shortages of staff occur and on RMTs, which provide program, administrative, technical and logistics support to OFDA DARTs from Washington.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND
The Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) is a program developed by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find in a timely manner adequate staff to cover all positions in the field, in Washington and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  OFDA's Senior Management Team (SMT) approved a program which would bring on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters.  RATS positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.

INTRODUCTION

OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (OFDA/DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM employs sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (OFDA/PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OFDA/OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Support Program (DASP), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The RATS program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in the OFDA/OPS Division.  This team maintains a database for all contracted RATS, providing information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  The OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified RATS for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing RATS.  Each RATS incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

OBJECTIVES
The SMT has determined that OFDA needs to maintain a roster of 50 to 75 RATS to meet its surge capacity objectives.  Each incumbent will be deployable to backfill Washington positions, to field offices for staff enhancement, on DARTs and RMTs as disaster response demands, and for assessments of critical situations as warranted.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
RATS respond to humanitarian emergencies -- natural, technological and conflict-related disasters -- as required, worldwide.  The contractor may serve in the OFDA Washington offices as staff enhancement when critical shortages of staff occur and on RMTs, which provide program, administrative, technical and logistics support to OFDA DARTs from Washington.  The contractor may also be required to travel on short notice as a critical component of a U.S. Government (USG) disaster assessment team or a DART or to backfill staff members in OFDA regional or program offices overseas.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>A. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subject 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. A1. This solicitation is issued as Request for Proposals RRB05R005. A2. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular Number 2005-05. A3. This solicitation is not a small business set-aside. A4. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) is issuing this Request for Proposal (RFP) to qualified firms to conduct a review of the RRB’s Financial Interchange (FI). A5.BACKGROUND: The RRB is an independent agency in the executive branch of the Federal government. Its primary function is to administer comprehensive retirement-survivor and unemployment-sickness insurance benefit programs for the nation's railroad workers and their families. These programs are provided under the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA). In addition, the RRB has administrative responsibilities under the Social Security Act for certain benefit payments and Medicare coverage for railroad workers. The FI is a collective term that describes a series of legally mandated periodic fund transfers between the RRB and the Social Security Administration, the RRB and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the RRB and the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury). In 1951, Congress enacted amendments that increased benefit levels under the RRA. This legislation guaranteed that benefits paid under the RRA would never be less than what would have been payable if the worker’s railroad earnings had been credited as Social Security employment instead of RRA covered compensation.  As part of that same legislative package, Congress established the FI between the Social Security and Railroad Retirement systems as an additional funding source. When the Medicare program was enacted in 1965, the Healthcare Financing Administration (now, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) became a party to the FI. In FY 2004, the RRB reported financing sources of approximately $10 billion of which $3.4 billion (34%) was attributable to the FI. FI transfers between the three agencies are made in a lump sum for an entire fiscal year in June, approximately 8-9 months after the end of the fiscal year. RRA Amendments enacted in 1981 and 1983 provide for monthly advances of amounts due under the FI from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury which are repaid at the time of the annual transfers. Interested parties may obtain more information about the RRB’s programs and financing from its public website U.S. Railroad Retirement Board Home Page. The available information includes descriptions of the agency’s organization and programs as well as financial reports prepared by the agency’s Bureau of Fiscal Operations and statistical and actuarial reports prepared by its Bureau of the Actuary.

<DESC>The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W911NF-05-R-0011 is to solicit proposals for the Department of Defense (DoD) Fiscal Year 2006 Medical Science and Technology (S&T) Chemical and Biological Defense Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative Fund (TMTIF).  The DoD conducts a vigorous medical research p rogram in chemical and biological defense with the goal of protecting the warfighter from disease and biological and chemical warfare agents.  The Chemical Biological Defense Program seeks to develop counter-measures that can be brought into acquisition an d fielded worldwide.  These products must be regulatory compliant, robust, and highly effective at a reasonable cost. Successful candidates must have a clear path to regulatory approval, production and end user utility. They must all be amenable to use in a military environment.   This BAA is focused on developing medical counter-measures to genetically engineered or non-traditional toxins, virulence factors and microorganisms as biological warfare (BW) threat agents.  This includes a faster bug-to-drug approach. It is anticipated t hat these counter-measures would include pre-treatments (including vaccines), therapeutics and basic science to characterize the nature of the threat and identify key targets for intervention or disruption of these agents. The agent classes that are to be focused on are: intra-cellular bacterial pathogens, hemorrhagic fever viruses and bioregulators.  Approaches to the objectives for this area include studying the genetic diversity and pathogenicity of natural isolates, identifying common structural elements of specific agents or classes of agents (preferred), elucidating common virulence mechanisms (su ch as type III secretory proteins), identifying functional domains in toxins and virulence factors, and using this information to develop rapid and effective medical countermeasures protecting against genetically engineered or emerging BW threats.  Through this BAA the DoD CBDP and the Army Research Office (ARO) expect to make several awards for one- to two-year performance periods, subject to the availability of appropriations.  Awards may be made as contracts or grants.  Single-year, stand-alone pr oposals are encouraged; multi-year proposals will be considered.  A total of up to approximately $63 million is anticipated to be available under this solicitation.  It is anticipated that funding will be between $1M to $4M per award. Interested offerors are required to submit white papers in accordance with instructions provided in Section IV.B. of this BAA.   The white paper must be received by 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, October 11, 2005.   Based on this evaluation, selected offer ors will be invited to submit full proposals for evaluation.    Technical point of contact for this BAA is Dr. Stephen J. Lee, Chemical Sciences Division, (919) 549-4365, email: stephen.lee2@us.army.mil.   The broad agency announcement for this program is located at the ARO web site: http://www.arl.army.mil/aro/research/index.htm.    The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710 -- Research and Development in the Physical, Engineer ing, and Life Sciences.  The Government reserves the right to not make an award if it is not in the best interest of the Government.

Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participat es in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees - Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates m ay be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priorit y for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12ft -5in clearance) will require a time stamped 'searched' label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  'Searched' labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle i s over 12ft-5in in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a 'searched' label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier , comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protecti on Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle mu st have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.

Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, m ust obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitor's pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitor's pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitor's pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on c ontractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.

If the CHBC is not adverse, a fa st access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is de nied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitor's pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitor's pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., q uits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame f or any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.

The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance no tice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.

This amendment 0001 is being issued to provide answers to questions that have been asked.   Any additional questions received will be posted at this site as soon as possible.   No extension to the due date is being granted as a result of questions.     

1)    The Statement of Work lists 'approximately' an 8 hours a day schedule.  To better price the requirement please provide us with exact hours of staffing.     ANSWER:  40 hours per week     

2A)  There appears to be no overlap of instructors.   Since there is only one person on-duty what happens when the fitness center manager gets sick or unforeseen emergency arises?     ANSWER:    The activities scheduled must be cancelled and/or the manager could schedule another qualified instructor.      

2B)  Would the center remain unmanned?      ANSWER:    Yes.     

3)   How many exercise classes per week exactly does the center wish to conduct?    Because of specialized training, many managers cannot teach all types of classes on the market.     ANSWER:     We would like to have a combination of 12-15 classes per week - yoga, step aerobics, resistance and body ball, Pilates, spinning.

INTRODUCTION

	This Contract is for Advisory and Assistance Services by non-governmental sources in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part  37 – Service Contracting and Part 15--Negotiated Contracts.

B.l		Summary

B.1.1		The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA)  is funding a Middle East and North Africa Information and Communications Technology Conference, which will take place in Muscat, Oman in late Spring 2006.  USTDA seeks to contract with a U.S. firm (Contractor) to research and write the Briefing Book for the conference.  The Contractor will propose a team with technical and business expertise in the information and communications technology (ICT) sector.  

B.1.2.		With the support of several U.S. government agencies, USTDA is planning a conference that will highlight issues and opportunities in the information and communications technology sector of the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA).  

The conference will tentatively be held over two-and-a-half days in late Spring 2006, in Muscat, Oman.  The conference would focus on market opportunities in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, Oman, and Lebanon.  Special emphasis will be placed on sector development and policy issues in Yemen, West Bank/Gaza and Iraq.  Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and UAE would be given observer status, due to their regional location and importance.  

Each of the participating countries in MENA has made significant progress in the last decade toward liberalizing its communications markets through deregulation, as well as developing better fixed-line services, Internet access, international bandwidth, and mobile phone density.  

One of the themes which has emerged from discussions to date is “Managing Competition,” which has important implications for U.S companies and for Middle Eastern and North African governments that wish to promote foreign investment in this sector.  Topics which could be addressed under this theme include:

·	Regulatory Landscape; 
·	Emerging Applications and Services;
·	Privatization;
·	Standards (focus on compliance with WTO rules); and
·	Spectrum Management.

The Conference will bring together project sponsors and information and communications technology sector government leaders from the national, state, and municipal levels in the participating countries, as well as a range of U.S. equipment suppliers and service providers catering to this industry.

We are targeting approximately 175 U.S. and foreign participants, with at least 50 U.S. company representatives and approximately 40 project delegates between the participating countries.  The conference will aim to balance policy and project objectives, and will feature one-on-one meetings, project presentations, and panel/roundtable discussions.

B.1.3.	As the technical expert responsible for the overall substance of the conference, the Contractor shall perform the following primary tasks: 
1.	Prepare a Briefing Book of country and sector overviews and at least 30 detailed project descriptions for projects to be presented at the Conference;
2.	Identification of U.S. companies to whom the conference should be marketed;
3.	Identification of project sponsors, speakers, and other special guests to be invited to the Conference;
4.	Assist USTDA and the logistical conference contractor to develop a detailed, substantive agenda for the conference; 
5.	Assist the host country sponsors in the development of presentations that will be made at the event; and 
6.	Attend the Conference to help with the agenda and facilitate the interaction between Conference attendees.

B.1.4		A separate logistics contractor will be hired to organize the logistics and execute the conference.  The Briefing Book contractor and the logistical conference contractor will be required to coordinate and cooperate with each other to successfully perform this work.

B.2.2		Payment shall be made by the payment office designated in Section G.3 of this contract 30 days after receipt of an acceptable Contractor’s Invoice in accordance with Section G.9.

B.2.3	The Contractor may invoice for up to 25% of the total contract price upon meeting with USTDA and the logistical contractor for a kickoff meeting and submittal to and acceptance of a workplan for the research and travel.

M.1.1		Information relevant to these criteria must be presented in accordance with the instructions in Section L.
	
M.1.2		The criteria have been tailored to the requirements of this particular solicitation.  Offerors should note that these criteria: (a) serve as the standard against which all technical proposals will be evaluated; (b) serve to identify the significant matters which Offerors should address in their technical proposals; and (c) will constitute 90% of the total evaluation criteria.

The Government may award a contract on the basis of initial offers received, without further discussion or negotiations. 

M.1.4		Award will be made to that Offeror: (1) whose proposal is technically acceptable; and (2) whose technical/cost relationship is most advantageous to the Government. While cost is secondary to technical, it will be a factor in the award decision. Award may not necessarily be made to that Offeror submitting the lowest cost proposal. Also, award may not necessarily be made for technical capabilities that would appear to exceed those needed for the successful performance of the work.  The Government reserves the right to make cost/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest and to the advantage of the Government.

M.1.5		Technical proposal shall constitute 90 percent of the overall score, while cost shall constitute 10 percent of the overall score.  The Offeror submitting the lowest cost proposal shall receive 10 points.  Each Offeror thereafter, shall be awarded points for cost in descending order, as described in Section M 4.

M.1.6		The factors used by the Government in determining the winning proposal are listed in Sections M.2 through M.4 in the order of their relative importance.  Quality will be subjectively judged in terms of technical excellence, capability, prior experience or past performance, schedule, and strategy.  The Government reserves the right to make selection decisions that are in the best interest and to the advantage of the Government on the basis of factors specified in this Solicitation.

M.1.7		Award may be made without further discussion or negotiations. The proposal should be submitted initially in the most favorable terms, from a cost and technical standpoint, which the Offeror can submit to the Government.
