<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Pittsburgh PA, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Advanced Mechanical Technology Inc. ( DBA AMTI) for: 1 - ACG SUITE- AccuGait Portable force platform with AMTI BioAnalysis, Balance Clinic, Balance Trainer Software and USB to Serial Adapter, 1- ACG2 - AccuGait Portable Force Platform without software, <br />2 - OR6-7-1000 - Biomechanics Force Platform (464 x 508 x 82.5 mm), 1000 lb capacity, 2 - SMF-1R - Mounting Fixture for OR6 Force Platforms with Pro-set Epoxy Adhesive 175/277, 2 - 7615-030-5-5 - Force Platform to Amplifier Cable (30 feet), 2 - MSA-6 - 6-channel MiniAmp Signal Conditioner/Amplifier and 1 - DT3034 - Data-Translation Dt3034 Analog/Digital Converter Card for BioAnalysis Software.
<p>AMTI should be considered a sole-source for this purchase due to the ability of their new components to interact digitally with our current AMTI system, and the ability to measure critical variables. While other force plate manufactories could provide force plates, they would be unable to digital interact with our current system. AMTI's NetForce software is a complete data acquisition solution designed to gather data from AMTI's multiaxis force platforms (our current system). NetForce provides an RS-232 serial data interface, thus allowing for laptop based data acquisition. This provides for the capacity to perform portable balance system measurements, and portable gait system (a critical planned research need). NetForce also expedites the data gathering process and helps organize and maintain your test results and subject information. NetForce interfaces directly with other AMTI products with a single click of the mouse. AMTI's BioAnalysis software package is a complete analysis suite ideal for gait and balance (our current research focus). The BioAnalysis software can be digitally integrated with AMTI products to provide a seamless acquisition and analysis system for biomechanics laboratories. BioAnalysis also provides a statistical analysis package which allows you to calculate averages and standard deviations over a range of selected trials for a large array of calculated gait, balance and power parameters. The statistical results may be printed or exported to text files for further analysis in third party spread sheet or analysis software. The Balance Module of BioAnalysis provides a suite of plotting and analytical tools for balance analysis. This module supports COP (center of pressure) plots, the 95th percentile ellipse plot, X and Y FFTs, radius vs. time, area vs. time, and Fx and Fy vs. time plots. The Balance Module also provides algorithms to calculate many balance related variables such as the X and Y COP means, standard deviations, path length, radial measures and balance parameters. These measures are important to our future research and are important functions of this force plate system.</p>
<p>This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to Advanced Mechanical Technology Inc., under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1).

<DESC><p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Procurement and Grants Office announces the upcoming release of the solicitation for Clinical Operations Services for Botswana off-site screening and enrollment clinics conducting a placebo controlled trial of the safety and efficacy of single daily oral dose of the antiretroviral (ARV) Truvada for the prevention of HIV infection among 1200 sexually active young adults in Botswana (referred to as TDF2 Trial).
<p>The anticipated period of performance will begin with Phase I: September 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010; Phase II: April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011; April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012 and Phase III: April 1, 2012 through September 30, 2012. Award is expected to be made on or before September 1, 2009.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to operate a screening clinic in Francistown, Botswana and a screening and enrollment clinic in Gaborone, Botswana to enable BOTUSA, the CDC collaboration with the government of Botswana to complete a randomized, placebo controlled trial of the safety and efficacy of a single daily oral dose of the antiretroviral Truvada for the prevention of HIV infection conducted among sexually active adults aged 18-39 years in Botswana. The scope of activities will range from Phase I clinical trial screening and enrollment, Phase II clinical trial follow-up and Phase III Clinical Trial Analysis.</p>
<p>CDC is sponsoring the HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) clinical trial in Botswana because safe and effective new approaches to HIV prevention are urgently needed. If proven safe and effective, PrEP could help address the urgent need for a female-controlled prevention method for women worldwide who are unable, because of cultural or other barriers, to negotiate condom use. Furthermore, if effective, it could provide an additional safety net for all men and women at risk when combined with reducing the number of sexual partners, HIV counseling and testing, condom use, and other prevention measures.</p>
<p>All responsible qualified entities are invited to submit a proposal to be considered by the Government. The estimated release date of the solicitation is 5/12/2009</p>
<p>All interested parties must submit their request in writing to the Contracting Specialist, Nancy Lindsey at nel0@cdc.gov. All requests for a solicitation package must be made by email and should reference solicitation number 2009-N-11207.</p>

<DESC><p>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of active cooling modules. DoD systems are driving conflicting needs for high performance as well as reduced size and weight.  DARPA makes many investments in new technologies that can improve performance or reduce size and weight.  Unfortunately, in many cases, the power consumption of these systems increases with each improvement.  As a result, the performance of heat rejection technology remains a key limitation in many applications.</p>
<p>The primary goal of this program is the development and demonstration of ideas based on novel materials and structures that can provide tens of degrees of cooling for 100W devices in cm-scale cooling modules with coefficient of performance (COP) of 3 or better.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Western-Pacific Region has awarded a short-term 6-month single source contract to Akal Security, Inc. for the FAA's Honolulu Control Facility located on Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu, HI.  The award was issued as a single source procurement based on the need to meet critical dates.
A competitive solicitation was issued in January 2009 (DTFAWP-09-R-90004).  The solicitation was canceled in February 2009 because of the FAA's redefinition of security guard vendor qualifications.  At that point it was decided that there was not sufficient time to announce, solicit and award a new contract and have a new contractor procure weapons and qualify his employees in time to meet the start date of April 1, 2009.  Therefore, a short-term 6-month contract was awarded to the incumbent contractor on a single source basis in the amount of $245,444.30.  The period of performance is from April 1, 2009 to September 30, 2009.
The FAA is considering transferring the security responsibilities of this facility to the Department of Homeland Security/Federal Protective Service (FPS) effective October 1, 2009.  However, if the FAA decides not to affect the transfer to FPS on this date, a new competitive solicitation will be announced.
All questions pertaining to this announcement should be addressed in writing to the Contracting Officer, James L. Travers at e-mail address james.travers@faa.gov or mailing address, FAA, Western-Pacific Region, WSA Acquisition Group - LA, AWP-052, P.O. Box 92007, Los Angeles, CA 90009-2007.

<DESC>A. Background

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals for a contractor to provide Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition CFSAN with a broad overview of the presence, frequency and levels of microbial pathogens in foods with emphasis on produce commodities. Outbreaks due to the contamination of produce have received a heightened interest from the American public.   

B. Scope of Work 

The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) has specific regulatory responsibilities directed at ensuring the safety of food, food additive, dietary supplement, and cosmetic products.  In part, CFSAN maintains an active research program for the purpose of developing and applying technologies to detect, to identify and evaluate microbial hazards that may contaminate products either naturally or intentionally. 

This contract is intended to provide CFSAN with a broad overview of the presence, frequency and levels of microbial pathogens in foods with emphasis on produce commodities. Outbreaks due to the contamination of produce have received a heightened interest from the American public. This contract should provide significant data on the prevalence of selected bacterial pathogens in a wide variety of produce commodities and a broad view of the presence of Salmonella in tomatoes.  The overarching objectives of this contract are to provide significant baseline data of potential microbiological hazards associated with the consumption of raw and minimally processed produce and to identify other microbial-related environmental and food-related risks.  

In order to better understand how pervasive microbial pathogens are in fresh produce commodities the objective of this contract is to analyze selected foods for the presence of Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli O157:H7.  As for ready-to-eat (RTE) foods, our focus will be on Listeria monocytogenes. Our plans include the generation of a database for these select produce as to the frequency of isolation/detection of the aforementioned pathogens in each commodity as it relates to its geographical location and growing season. 

The emphasis of this contract is to focus on obtaining data that will reflect a broader scope of the frequency and levels of bacteriological human pathogens that have historically been associated with fresh produce commodities and a variety of RTE foods. In order to better understand how pervasive microbial pathogens are in fresh produce commodities the objective of this contract is to analyze selected foods for the presence of Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli O157:H7.  As for RTE foods, our focus will be on Listeria monocytogenes. Our plans include the generation of a database for these select produce as to the frequency of isolation/detection of the aforementioned pathogens in each commodity as it relates to its geographical location and growing season. 

The impact of such data collection could have an affect on any Produce Safety Regulatory Options Developed by FDA with the following parameters: Consistent across the U.S., based on sound science, overarching (most commonly consumed fresh produce), accommodate specifics (commodity, region, operations, practices, size of establishment), and allow the U.S. to meet its obligations under WTO SPS.

C. Additional Information 

 It is anticipated that one (1)  Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be awarded with a one (1) year base period and four (4) option years. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). FDA anticipates release of the RFP on or around May 8, 2009 and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is on or before or after July 1, 2009.

<SUBJECT>Preventing Motor Vehicle Crashes among Young Drivers: Research on Driving Risk Amoung Novice Teen Drivers"
<SOLNBR>NIH-NICHD-DESPR-09-16
<RESPDATE>060809
<CONTACT>Rukshani M Fernando, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-402-8552, Fax 301-4023676, Email rf212s@nih.gov - Seena Mathews, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-4965, Fax 301-402-3676, Email mathewss@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.   A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Branch, Office of Acquisitions intends to negotiate a 3 year extension to the contract with Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) to continue research on preventing motor vehicle crashes among young drivers.  The planned extension will enable VTTI to continue this research without delay, advance the work, extend data analyses, and enhance the value of the study to the government and science. 

The requirements of the contract are:  
   •Develop additional measures of driving performance, including error scores for  
    intersection, merge, and straight road segments;
   •conduct additional coding and “reduction” of data for analyses of crashes and near 
    crashes, driving performance, and eye glance;
   •compare driving performance and risk between teens and parents; 
   • conduct additional analyses of the data collected on driving performance by driving 
     conditions; 
   •compare the driving data collected and similar data  collected by VTTI with other funding,   
    including under separate contracts from the Department of Transportation (DOT), Virginia 
    DOT, and other sources; 
   •compare driving performance among youth from different school districts with varied 
    supervised practice driving experience

Substantial amounts of data have been collected but cannot be coded and analyzed within the original budget.  VTTI will conduct data coding, reduction, and analyses of these data and related sets.  These additional analyses will provide new information about how driving performance among young drivers varies over time and under various driving conditions.  The proposed work would provide new information about important research questions that have implications for behavioral, technical, and policy interventions to reduce crashes among young drivers.  

Statutory authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The contractor is uniquely qualified by virtue of its continued performance over this period of time and is the only source that can provide the data for the following reasons:   Under the existing contract VTTI has recruited the 40 teenage drivers and will complete data collection during the summer of 2008.  Recruiting is underway for the 100 teenagers and their parents whose vehicles will be instrumented from the time of permit to license plus 6 months.  VTTI developed the technology that is being used for these studies and only VTTI has the capacity for standardized and validated data coding and reduction procedures for assessing driving performance, risk, and crash/near crash events.   

The unique qualifications of the contractor include the following: 

   1) This research involves the collection of massive amounts of data too large to transfer.  
       The data is stored electronically in a structure built for this purpose at the VTTI with 
       elaborate data security provisions.  
   2) VTTI is the proprietary owner of the vehicle instrumentation used to collect the data and   
        is uniquely qualified to code, reduce, and analyze the data.
   3) VTTI has developed unique, standard coding and data reduction procedures for the 
       naturalistic data collected, including video footage and accelerometer data
   4) VTTI has developed standard training procedures for data reduction in these processes.  
   5) The data are highly confidential, given the use of cameras in the vehicle and could not 
       ethically be made available to other researchers before the data were reduced and 
       subject confidentiality could be assured.  The data reduction laboratory provides unique  
       data confidentiality procedures.  

No other contractor has a naturalistic driving assessment system that includes in-vehicle camera, accelerometers, and GPS, connected to the ODP port and a CPU that can be mounted in the trunk of the vehicle.  No other contractor has experience collecting, storing, coding, reducing, and analyzing data of this nature.  
 
While the government retains unlimited data rights, it is not feasible for the government to take control of data storage, given its size and security requirements. To obtain the proposed data from a contractor other than VTTI, the government would need to (1) fund a full observational study that would cost millions of dollars and take many years and be highly duplicative; or (2) contract with an offeror that would subcontract with VTTI to provide data collection, coding, reduction and analyses, resulting in much higher costs to the government. This would be duplicative of costs and work already paid for by the existing contract with VTTI and would be redundant, time consuming, and expensive.  

However, if there are sources who feel they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting information (5 page limit) required in Numbered Note 22 within 45 days of publication of this synopsis. 

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Overnight deliveries should be mailed to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510.  No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted. Respondents may submit their capability statements via email in addition to 2 hard copies

Proposals are not requested at this time and will not be accepted until after a solicitation is released on or around 31 July 2009. The solicitation will be released as a 100% small business set aside. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334515, with a small business set size standard of 500 employees or less. 

The TSCIS provides engine performance information to the pilot and co-pilot, two (2) identical gauges per aircraft.  The new TSCIS shall incorporate the functionality of the signal conditioners and torquemeter indicators into one indicator that fits into the existing torquemeter indicator position in the existing CH-46E instrument panel   No new support equipment shall be required.  The Functional Requirements Document for the H-46E TSCIS will be used for technical and environmental requirements for this procurement.  The key performance parameters for the new TSCIS are:  (1) Shall be compatible and capable of being integrated with existing H-46E torque measuring system; (2) Shall meet or exceed the accuracy of the H-46E Aircraft integrated Maintenance System (AIMS); (3) Shall meet the fit and functionality of the existing torquemeter indicator; (4) Shall provide torque signal validity; (5) Shall require no peculiar support equipment; (6) Shall have minimal operational and maintenance impact; (7) Shall combine the functionality of the current H-46E signal conditioner and torquemeter indicator into one indicator that utilizes the existing location on both the pilot and co-pilot consoles; (8) Shall be Night Vision Goggle (NVG) compatible; and (9) Shall be at least as reliable as the current torque signal conditioner and torque gauge.  Due to the expected retirement of the CH-46E in the near future, it is desired that the TSCIS be currently in use or be capable of being used on other USMC helicopters such as the H-1 series, CH-53D/E  or MV-22 or on other military aircraft operated currently by the Department of Defense.

The CH-46E program is looking to expedite the fielding of these new engine performance instruments.  The Preliminary Design Review (PDR) will be conducted within two (2) months after contract award and the Critical Design Review (CDR) will be conducted within five (5) months after contract award.  Installation on the CH-46E aircraft must begin in April 2011.  The estimated quantity for this procurement is 210 Indicators for the TSCIS for a total of 95 aircraft plus spares, two (2) Indicators to support the CH-46E System Integration Laboratory, and two (2) Indicators with associated drawings and cables for Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) testing, for a total of 214 instruments for the TSCIS.  The TSCIS will be procured over a three-year period.  The contract will be firm-fixed price with a base year and two (2) option years.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD intends to conduct a full and open competition for the development, manufacture, integration, test, delivery, and support of a CH-46E helicopter engine power turbine inlet temperature (T5) indicator gauge.  Proposals are not requested at this time and will not be accepted until after a solicitation is released on or around 31 July 2009.  The solicitation will be released as a 100% small business set aside. The NAICS code for this requirement is 334515, with a small business size stnadard of 500 employees or less.

The Engine power turbine inlet temperature (T5) gauge provides engine performance information to the pilot and copilot and there are two (2) identical gauges per aircraft.  The upgraded T5 gauge will have all the same functionality as the current gauge and will fit into the same size hole and location in the current instrument panel as the current T5 gauge. The CH-46E T5 gauge specification will be used to address all detailed technical or environmental issues. The key performance parameters for the new T5 gauge are:  (1) Shall have a mechanical needle much like the current gauge; (2) Shall have a digital NVG compatible display indicating the temperature in degrees Celsius in one (1) degree increments; (2) Shall be as accurate as the current AIMS system, which is plus or minus one (1) degree across the entire range; (3) Shall be NVG compatible;  (4) Shall be able to alert the pilot that he is approaching any of the T5 limits published in the current CH-46E operators manual; (5) Shall require no new support equipment; (6) Shall have minimal operational and maintenance impact; and (7) Shall be at least as reliable as the current gauge.  Due to the expected retirement of the CH-46E in the near future it is desired that the upgraded T5 gauge be currently in use or be capable of being used on other USMC helicopters such as the H-1 series, CH-53D/E  or MV-22 or on other military aircraft operated currently by the Department of Defense.

The CH-46E program is looking to expedite the fielding of these new engine performance instruments.  A combined Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Critical Design Review (CDR) will be conducted within four (4) months after contract award.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to place a sole-source order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-05-G-0026 with McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC) (A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Boeing Company) of St. Louis, Missouri 63166, for the procurement of non-recurring engineering efforts in support of the investigation of the electromagnetic aircraft launch system.  General Atomics (GA) is developing the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) to replace the Navy’s existing steam catapults.  To date, the EMALS has not been tested with Navy aircraft and the risk exists that undesirable forces or oscillations could result during a launch event.  While there are mitigations within the EMALS control system to combat any unforeseen unanticipated forces and oscillations, it is not desirable to expose an airframe to these conditions.  In order to obtain flight clearance and to mitigate the risk associated with launching an aircraft, MDC's Modular Six-Degree of Freedom (MODSDF) will be used to simulate catapult launches using catapult outputs from the EMALS System Model.  Loads analysis will be performed to determine if EMALS poses a significant risk associated with aircraft compatibility.  In addition, if the analysis does uncover any unforeseen issues, it will permit some level of tuning of the EMALS control system to be carried forward to actual aircraft compatibility testing.
To support this effort, MDC shall:

a)	Shall attend a joint meeting with NAVAIR and GA to discuss the optimal method to integrate the EMALS System Model and MDC's MODSDF.  This integration method needs to address the differences between the two models and how to best transmit information between the models, what information to transmit, and when to transmit this information while running simulations.   At this meeting, the Contractor shall provide a discussion on the details of the MODSDF Model, in addition to a higher level written description of the model.  This meeting shall be of approximately one day’s duration.

b)	Modify the MODSDF Model, as defined from the previous task, to permit the integration of the EMALS System Model to permit simulation of the launch event.

c)	Shall attend a workshop with NAVAIR and GA.  This workshop shall be a total of approximately one week’s duration in one or two parts.

d)	Support the actual integration of the EMALS System Model and MDC's MODSDF in to a cohesive model that can simulate the entire launch event.  The Contractor shall provide troubleshooting for any issues that present themselves during this software integration effort.  MDC shall provide a batch capability for GA to run the EMALS/MODSDF simulation to allow GA to fine tune certain MODSDF output parameters.

e)	Support exercising the Integrated Model for a one F/A-18E/F FE (fighter escort) clean aircraft configuration.  The Contractor shall provide troubleshooting for any issues that present themselves during this simulation effort with regard to the operation of the Integrated Model.  The Contractor shall support technical interpretation of the results of the simulations as to the efficacy of the EMALS and its control systems.

f)	MDC shall perform a loads analysis of the aircraft and external store attachments and recommend critical aircraft configurations for the EMALS catapults.

Projected period of performance is 30 May 2009 through 28 February 2010.  MODSDF is MDC proprietary modeling software.  MDC is the sole designer, developer, manufacturer and integrator of the F/A-18E/F/G aircraft in its various configurations.  MDC is the only source with the software, hardware, equipment, knowledge, expertise, facilities, and qualified personnel necessary to accomplish this effort to meet NAVAIR’s technical, cost, and sechedule requirements.  Any interested party (respondent) must have the software, hardware, equipment, knowledge, expertise, facilities, and qualified personnel necessary to accomplish this effort to meet NAVAIR’s technical, cost, and sechedule requirements.  Any respondent must also submit a Statement of Qualifications to demonstrate respondent’s ability to perform to the Government’s needs within the required response time.  This synopsis is for informational purposes only.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to award on a Sole Source basis a firm-fixed price contract to L-3 Communications Klein Associates, Inc., 11 Klein Drive, Salem, NH 03079 to procure the following:
One (1) each Klein Model AUV 5000V2 Dynamically Focused Multi-Beam Side Scan Sonar comprised of:-  Sonar Processor Unit (SPU), installed in a stainless steel Pressure Housing, P/N 14104577-  Sonar Electronics Unit (SEU), installed in a stainless steel Pressure Housing, P/N 14104568-  Port Transducer Assembly w/ C-Channel strong back, P/N 14104648-  Starboard Transducer Assembly w/ C-Channel strong back, P/N 14104648-  Deck Power Supply, P/N 11700053-  Jumper Cable, 100 inch, P/N 12900916-01-  Deck Cable, 20m, P/N 14104595-  SonarPro (CD) Visualization Software License, P/N 14104488--  Manual (CD), P/N 11214513
     This procurement is sole source for the following reasons:  This L-3 Klein Sonar is required for continued operation of a fielded system incorporating the previous version of this sonar system.  The form and fit of this new sonar is identical to that of the original system.  More importantly, the data stream from the new version of the system is identical to that of the existing system, maintaining full functional compatibility.  To change to any other sonar system at this time would require significant redesign efforts for the fielded system, in particular the processing of the data, which would negate any potential savings from attempting to competitively selecting a different sonar system.  The design of this system is proprietary to L-3 Klein, thus they are the only source for these systems.

Thisnotice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes and theproposed/contract action is for supplies or services for which the Governmentintends to negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify theirinterest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes. Quotesreceived prior to the award date will be considered by the Government.Adetermination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based uponresponses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose ofdetermining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The design of thispart is unstable. Engineering, manufacturing, or performance characteristicsindicate that the required design objectives have not been achieved. Majorchanges are contemplated because the part has a low process yield or hasdemonstrated marginal performance during tests or service use. These changeswill render the present part obsolete and unusable in its present configuration.Limited acquisition from the present source is anticipated pending configurationchanges. -SEE NOTES 9, 26

<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Yerevan, Armenia, intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) from qualified organizations interested in implementing a technical assistance program to support Pension and Labor Market Reform (PALM) program in Armenia. USAID plans a single award for 3-year cost plus fixed fee, completion type contract with a total estimated cost in the range of $5 to $6 million for the implementation of this activity. To achieve this, the PALM program will target two key social protection areas: (i) pension reform implementation – build the Government of Armenia (GOAM) institutional and human resource capacity to implement a multi-pillar pension system that will provide an adequate income for its elderly population in an environment that is fiscally sound and sustainable, with reformed current pay-as-you-go (PAYG) scheme and the newly created private retirement savings system; and (ii) labor market interventions – help the GOAM and the most vulnerable individuals to mitigate the economic and social consequences of the global economic crisis by assisting the government and the private sector to: 1) give greater attention to countering the effects of the economic downturn which significantly affected the already inefficient Armenian labor market, 2) catalyze new linkages at the local level between the private sector, local authorities, and vocational training institutions to address labor market gaps, and 3) improve the country’s workforce.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Project Title:  U.S Bankruptcy Courtroom Renovation
Location:  Max Rosenn United States Courthouse, Wilkes Barre, PA
Solicitation Number:  GS-03P-09-CD-C-0024

This requirement is for the procurement of a construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for the construction of a new combined district and bankruptcy courtroom. This project will include the installation of a new jury room with toilets,   minor electrical systems upgrade of power and lighting, security and Audio Visual system infrastructure, mechanical, plumbing and sprinkler system upgrades with general space alterations.  The courtroom and ancillary spaces is approximately 2,400 gross square feet (223 gross square meters).  The Max Rosenn US Courthouse completed in 1933, is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. 

The successful firm must have previous experience with similar size and scope of construction projects with particular emphasis on Courthouse renovations & alterations. 
Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.  Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, management and key personnel qualifications.  The approximate duration of the contract is one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days.  The estimated cost of this project is between $1,000,000.00 to $2,000,000.00. 
 

The acquisition may consist of four (4) phases:  Phase 1 – Receipt and evaluation of technical offers and initial price proposals.  Phase 2 – Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms.  In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not it will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors on the basis of GSA's opinion.  GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3.  Phase 3 – A determination of the competitive range shall be developed by the Contracting Officer.  Phase 4 – Completion of negotiations with firms in the competitive range, if necessary.  Receipt and evaluation of final proposal revisions.  

Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price.  The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 3, without negotiations.  The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  1. Past Performance, 2. Management and Key Personnel Qualifications.  The NAICS code applicable to this project is 236220.  This unrestricted procurement is being conducted under full and open competitive provisions in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The purpose of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program is to assess the ability of small businesses to compete successfully in certain industry categories without competition being restricted by the use of small business set-asides.  This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice.

<DESC><p>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to issue a solicitation within the next thirty (30) days for a Warrior Wellness Program to improve the Special Operations Wounded Warrior recovery outcome by early introduction of casualty mentors and providing awareness regarding motivating activities available that boost their confidence and self esteem to better compete for wounded warrior friendly employment opportunities developed through community outreach and employment network development.
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation announcement only. Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available, and no formal requests for proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement is currently available. Requests for the same will be disregarded.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: A solicitation 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business is being considered by the Government. However, no formal acquisition strategy decision has been made at this time.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance of the program would begin upon contract award in the forth quarter of FY 2009 and run for a five (5) to six (6) month period. It is envisioned that a contract would be established at time of initial award allowing five (5) additional option periods in the contract. Four of the options would run for twelve (12) with the final option period lasting six (6) to seven (7) months. The anticipated period of performance, inclusive of all options would be from time of contract award through 5 years.<br /><br />Any resulting solicitation will call for a Contractor to design, develop, and implement a Warrior Wellness Program addressing the following:</p>
<p>Mentorship Program: Develop confidence in hospitalized, but stable casualties and their families by increasing recuperation process awareness and hope in the future through long-term positive relationships with mentors of similar injuries.</p>
<p>Wellness: Increase the wounded warrior's, families', and hospital staff's awareness of existing quality of life programs through distribution of information and by collaborating with medical treatment facility therapy centers.</p>
<p>Community Outreach: Educate community leaders, businesses, and civic organizations where casualties transition on specific interests and needs of returning wounded warriors to establish a solid foundation for casualty's reintegration into the community.</p>
<p>Resource Networks: Develop a community resource network to capitalize on the success of the mentorship, wellness, and community outreach programs. The Contractor shall also provide access to employment opportunities and community resources further enhancing the special operations wounded warrior's recovery outcome.</p>
<p>Operational Health Advanced Training Program: Provide a program to improve the physical and mental abilities of the wounded warriors returning to active duty with personalized military/tactical performance training in order to give them additional tools to succeed within the military environment.</p>
<p>Advocacy: Educate wounded warriors on available benefits/resources, and interact with Government agencies on their behalf in order to optimize their benefits.</p>
<p>The overall performance objectives include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>a. Severely injured casualties and families verbalize a greater understanding of the recovery "way-ahead" and demonstrate improved recovery rate due to mentor support.</p>
<p>b. Greater casualty involvement in outside activities that have been facilitated through Warrior Wellness Program.</p>
<p>c. A recognized decrease in unemployment rate of casualties leaving military service.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have the ability to provide support identified at various locations within the United States as directed by the Government. However, it is anticipated that the primary place of performance will be at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington D.C. The secondary place of performance is anticipated to be Brooke Army Medical Center located at Fort Sam Houston, TX.</p>
<p>Potential sources must possess an active Facility Clearance (FCL) or be eligible to obtain an FCL at the SECRET level.</p>
<p>This procurement is 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.</p>

Colombia - Port of Salgar Terminal Rehabilitation Feasibility Study
The Grantee (Sociedad Portuaria Multimodal del Río Magdalena, S.A.) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study to renovate the existing terminal at the Port of Salgar.
The objective of the Port of Salgar Terminal Rehabilitation Feasibility Study in Colombia is to renovate the existing terminal at the Port of Salgar, which is an inland port, centrally located between the large economic centers of Bogotá and Medellín on the Magdalena River.  The Magdalena River is the largest river in Colombia and traverses almost the entire length of the country, linking the major coastal hubs of Barranquilla and Cartagena to the interior economic centers of Bogotá and Medellín.  The development of the Magdalena River is a priority for the Colombian government. The Uribe Administration established an initiative titled “Proyecto Yuma”, which seeks to revitalize the country’s main waterways as an efficient mode of commercial navigation and to alleviate surface transportation congestion within the country. The Port of Salgar is located along the Magdalena River near the town of La Dorada in central Colombia and has been targeted for revitalization.  The initiative aims to eventually raise cargo traffic on the river to 5.1 million tons per year.
The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Feasibility Study include the following tasks:
1) Review existing conditions; 2) commodity forecast and market analysis; 3) evaluation of tug and barge requirements; 4) preparation of alternative repair solutions and alternative terminal designs; 5) interim presentation; 6) development and environmental impacts; and 7) final report and presentation.
The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $415,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to
https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp
Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.
Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA-financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source, and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.
Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by

<DESC>Application for Brand Name JustificationEach justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited. As required of FAR 6.302-1( c ), each justification shall include the following information:  1.   Requesting Agency:   Department of Veterans Affairs        Contracting activity:		Austin Automation Center1615 Woodward StreetAustin, TX 78772 2. Nature and/or description of the action:   This is a Name Brand Justification for VA to pursue an award for a delivery order against NASA SEWP for information technology (IT) software in support of the SAM Project.  Specifically, the purpose of this acquisition is to acquire M Data Extractor (MDE) software and associated licensees for SAM data management efforts at the FLITE Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC) Beta sites.  Award of a Firm, Fixed-Price (FFP) delivery order is anticipated.  The Department of Veterans Affairs Financial and Logistics Integrated Technology Enterprise (FLITE) has two primary components: an asset management component referred to as the Strategic Asset Management (SAM) Project, and a financial management system component referred to as the Integrated Financial Accounting System (IFAS) Project.  The SAM Project is deploying an information technology (IT)-based asset management system, and the IFAS Project will provide the compliant integrated federal financial management system processing.The SAM Project is comprised of five phases:  Advanced Concept Exploration (ACE) Phase (completed in October 2006 and was not an acquisition), Pilot Phase, Beta Phase, Demonstration and Validation Phase, and National Deployment Phase.  VA requires legacy data extraction software to support SAM data management efforts for the Development, and Test environments.   3.   A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):  The brand-name items which are requested are Strategic Reporting Systems, inc. M Data Extractor (MDE) licensees.  M Data Extractor (MDE) software has two distinct methods of licensing:1.	 A client service plan for Oracle.a.	 Annual support for site license with unlimited site clients for data extraction from VistA to Oracle database.b.	Yearly purchase required for M Data Extractor (MDE-V5.X- Oracle license).2.	 M Data extractor subscription rental for Oracle.a.	 Annual rental of a server site license with unlimited site clients for data extraction from VistA to Oracle database including the client service plan.ITEM NO.

An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.     FAR Part 6.302-1   "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements"  5.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. During the Beta phases of the program the SAM system will be hosted at the AITC, which is a pre-configured, established and Capability Maturity Model (CMM) Level II compliant data center.  The asset management software package which will be implemented for SAM is IBM; s Maximo.  The Maximo product is designed to function in conjunction with an RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) as per FLITE/SAM configuration architecture the RDBMS is Oracle. The VistA (Legacy) system is the current operational computer application platform and the technical infrastructure that supports the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provision of health care to the nation's veterans.  It includes the hardware, software (over 100 applications), databases, and staff necessary to operate and maintain the system. VistA (Legacy) was developed using the MUMPS language that is becoming increasingly difficult to support as the number of qualified MUMPS software developers is diminishing.  While the existing design was key to meeting VHA needs over the past 20 years, too much time and resources are now needed to maintain the VistA (Legacy) platform.  Today, more modern and efficient technical alternatives exist to support the VistA (Legacy) functions, which will make it easier and less costly to maintain.  The data storage utilizes is an open system architecture, public domain, vender independent technology called FileMan.  FileMan consists of a set of M routines and functions like any DBMS, has some distinct limitations:1.	 Built with MUMPS2.	Hierarchical StorageThe SAM system hardware which will be utilized in the AITC will be configured using a UNIX operating system.  The UNIX operating system does not support the installation of M-based systems and thus cannot be considered as a candidate for the SAM database environment.  The Department of Veterans Affairs selected the UNIX operating environment as the OS of choice as part of its enterprise architecture over 10 years ago.  The UNIX OS is a standard enterprise server system specification at all VA hosting facilities including AITC and the Regional Data Processing Centers.The SAM system requires an enterprise-wide extraction of legacy data that spans many departments, sites, and facilities to provide the depth and breadth of the Maximo Asset Management system's data requirement into a RDBMS environment.  But, meeting this requirement in M-based systems is constrained by M's inherent hierarchical data organization and storage.  Several approaches have been developed in an attempt to remedy this constraint.  They include: "	Creating interface engines"	Writing M routines"	Adding an SQL layer "	Developing custom interfacesEach of these approaches has demonstrated certain value in limited contexts but each has also experienced severe limitation:"	Interface engines offer are expensive to build, costly to maintain, and incomplete in their ability to access and retrieve all data from an M-based system."	Writing M routines to call specific pieces of M data requires the technical expertise of an M programmer, which can create technical dependencies again costly."	Adding an SQL layer to FileMan data structures is prohibited in a VA production Vista system:  the key statement in the April 23, 2008 CASH Mapper Memo is:  "Implementation of the subject software tool in VistA production environments is strictly prohibited.  This prohibition will continue from the date of this memorandum until further analysis of the tool can be conducted and specific recommendations and procedures are published by Enterprise Infrastructure Engineering (EIE)."Give the aforementioned limitations to these approaches, and within the scope of the FLITE program is the requirement to provide a BETA extraction solution:"	In line and in support of the One VA initiative"	Seamlessly spanning functions, departments, sites and facilities"	Is inexpensive to develop, deploy and maintain"	Is capable of accessing all data stored within an M-based system"	Is up and running within hours of installation.M Data Extractor (MDE) however is a COTA product that makes possible robust, high performance data extractions from FileMan-based systems, running on M and Cache platforms.  The extractions are placed into RDBMS', ready for use by mainstream technologies such as data warehouse/mart, or software applications and meets the challenge by addressing three principal issues:1.	 How to extract and migrate large amounts of M data from FileMan data structures to relational databases2.	How to conduct large-scale data analysis on data located in M-based systems.3.	And non SQL Mapper solutions mature and robust to meet FLITE/SAM requirements. The central values of the M Data Extractor (MDE) are:"	Requires no changes to be made to the FileMan system,"	Requires no changes to be made to the M code"	Does not use SQL, ODBC or data mappings to produce data extractions"	Does not add any layer of technology to the FileMan data structure itself"	Automatically recognizes and adapts itself to any updates or modifications made to FileMan data structures"	Uses a familiar easy-to-understand Window GUI interface for data extraction process"	Uses a simple installation process"	Can be run in both interactive (manual) and batch (automated) modes.  6.   A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.   This requirement will be solicited on either a SEWP or GSA schedule, allowing many resellers to compete for this requirement.  7.  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.   SEWP and GSA have already competed the products on their schedules.  The previous price competition ensures that the pricing of the latter orders are considered fair and reasonable.  8. A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.   This item is widely available on SEWP and GSA schedule.  By searching on the part number in the established catalog or price lists available at the websites of http://www.sewp.nasa.gov and http://www.gsaadvantage.gov it can be shown that many vendors are able to compete for this requirement. 9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: (i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. (ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. (iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.   N/A10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.     N/A  11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.    See the answer to questions 8 and 5.

<DESC>B-2 Training System (TS) Sources Sought Notice			19 March 2007 Description REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor’s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor’s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor’s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor’s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor’s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

Some of these activities include evaluating new satellite program requirements for AFSCN compatibility, integration, test and troubleshooting support for new systems and programs, technical consultation for pre-launch, launch and on-orbit problem resolution, and other unique AFSCN-specific complications that cannot be resolved by other organizations.</p>
<p>Obscura support provides for data collection, analysis, and management for Obscura (hard and soft Obscura), Radiation Hazard (RADHAZ), Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs), and determination of Transmit Inhibit Zones (TIZs) for the AFSCN, including the development and operation of an automated obscura analysis capability. Obscura data provides the information required to effectively establish and maintain terrain and building survey data (known as "hard" obscura data) as well as vegetation growth ("soft" obscura) that can interfere with reception and transmission of satellite data. <br />Additionally, obscura data is collected when new antennas are installed or construction is underway for these new assets, or any near-by constructions or activities. Obscura data is also gathered which will identify the optimal location to maximize satellite support activities.&nbsp;Obscura support includes the analysis of raw obscura data from the 85th Engineering Installation Squadron (85 EIS) and utilizes the Automated Obscura and Analysis Capability (AOAC) tool to establish recommended TIZs for the AFSCN to ensure the safety of personnel from RF exposure. Obscura surveys involve obtaining and recording measured Electromagnetic data, and then analyzing, smoothing, and documenting recommended values to update the AFSCN Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS) Antenna Control Units (ACUs) for implementation of the recommended TIZ values.</p>
<p>Network-Common Data Support manages and distributes data which is vital and common to all AFSCN users. This effort is accomplished through the Network Data Management and Control (NDMC) effort which manages, maintains, and modifies the network-common (NET-C) data stored in a central repository accessed by AFSCN users for the implementation of distinct operational parameters critical to their mission success.</p>
<p><strong>Notice to Interested Parties:</strong><br />This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. All information regarding a competitive source selection will be available for public viewing on FedBizOpps at http://www.eps.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)Radiation Capabilities for the Europa Jupiter System MissionPlanetary Science Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASASolicitation Number:		NNH09ZDA008LRelease Date:			April 24, 2009Response Date:			May 22, 2009The Government is seeking information regarding the state-of-technology, includingradiation-hardened parts/components, services, facilities, and general expertise, whichcould prove useful to NASA and instrument providers in addressing the radiationchallenges for the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM).  Through this RFI, the Government desires to improve its understanding of thestate-of-technology and technology maturity for technologies and techniques that willaddress the radiation challenges for the EJSM.	This RFI is also intended to survey theradiation industry for expertise, services, and radiation-hardened parts/components thatcould prove useful to NASA and potential instrument providers.	Information gatheredthrough this RFI could directly affect acquisition strategies developed for the EJSM.In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), the information requested is for planning purposes onlyand is not intended to bind the Government. This information will be used to informNASAs program planning, including consideration of whether and how to solicitinstruments for the EJSM.BackgroundThe Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) is a strategic flagship-class mission partneringNASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) that will send two spacecraft to explore theJupiter system with a focus on Europa and Ganymede.  The mission is currently informulation and is scheduled to launch in 2020.  The objectives of the EJSM are: * Determine the presence and extent of sub-surface oceans and their relations to thedeeper interior;* Characterize the ice shells and any subsurface water, including the heterogeneity ofthe ice, and the nature of surface-ice-ocean exchange;* Characterize the deep internal structure, differentiation history, and (for Ganymede)the intrinsic magnetic field; * Compare the exospheres, plasma environments, and magnetospheric interactions;* Determine global surface compositions and chemistry, especially as related tohabitability;* Understand the formation of surface features, including sites of recent or currentactivity, and identify and characterize candidate sites for future in situ exploration; * Understand the Jovian satellite system, especially as a context for Europa andGanymede; * Evaluate the structure and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere;* Characterize processes in the Jovian magnetodisk/magnetosphere;* Determine the interactions occurring in the Jovian system; and* Constrain the origin of the Jovian system.NASA and ESA expect to place two spacecraft in orbit around Jupiter to conduct scientificinvestigations for at least 2 years.  Following this tour, one spacecraft (the JupiterEuropa Orbiter, JEO) will enter a low orbit around Jupiters moon Europa and the otherspacecraft (the Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter, JGO) will enter orbit around Jupiters moonGanymede.  This mapping phase at Europa and Ganymede will last at least 9 months for eachspacecraft.  At the end of the mission the JEO and the JGO are estimated to have receivedTotal Ionizing Doses (TID) as shown in Figure 1 available at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/    (select "solicitations", select "open solicitations", select "NNH09ZDA008L").  Also,the peak dose rate expected for the JEO is about 2.3 rad(Si)/sec at 5 Jupiter radiibehind a 100-mil (2.5 mm) aluminum shield. The JGO flux rate is not expected to be overlysevere.  The minimum die level part capability for the JEO is expected to be 100 krad(Si)behind 100 mils of Al.	No such minimum part requirement is expected for the JGO.  Massand power are expected to be constrained leading to the desire for parts/components,services and tools which can help ensure robust spacecraft/instrument designs.	Theinstrument payload and providers for the spacecraft will be competitively selected via afuture Announcement of Opportunity.Additional information on the EJSM can be found at: http://opfm.jpl.nasa.gov/	  .Description of Anticipated Requirement In order to implement the EJSM, NASA and its eventual instrument providers must addressthe challenges posed by the high radiation environment in the Jupiter system,particularly near Europa.  The Government seeks to raise its awareness of thecapabilities of the radiation industry that could benefit this effort and the potentialinstrument providers.  Respondents judged to have provided information applicable to the EJSM will be providedan opportunity to participate in the upcoming instrument workshop to be held July 15-17,2009, in Washington, DC.  This NASA-sponsored workshop is intended to encourage the earlyformation of science and engineering teams interested in providing instruments to theEJSM and to educate these instrument teams on the radiation challenges of the mission. NASA also intends to make available via the EJSM website (http://opfm.jpl.nasa.gov/    )all unrestricted (not proprietary, confidential, or ITAR-restricted) informationpresented at the workshop to allow teams not attending the workshop the ability to obtainthe information.It is not NASAs intent to publicly disclose proprietary information obtained during thisRFI, although NASA may seek permission at a future date to share this information withinterested potential instrument and spacecraft component providers.  To the full extentthat it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws andregulations, information identified by a respondent as Proprietary or Confidential willbe kept confidential.  Additionally, ITAR restricted information should be labeled assuch.  It is emphasized that this RFI is for planning and information purposes only andis not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractualagreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Requested InformationThe response to this RFI will be in the form of a PDF document that is uploaded throughNASAs NSPIRES system (see instructions below). At a minimum the response must include upto 2 pages of unrestricted information which is suitable to be posted on the web.  Ifdesired, up to 5 additional pages of information may be included which is Proprietary,""Confidential, or ITAR Restricted.  This material must be marked appropriately andwill be treated by NASA according to the markings.  The response must contain the following information:* Name of submitter and contact information (institutional affiliation, email address);* Capabilities and qualifications statement that addresses your ability to provideexpertise, services, components, facilities, or technologies to mitigate and/or operatewithin the radiation environment expected for the EJSM spacecraft;* A description of the respondent's applicable expertise, services, components,facilities, or technologies, including (if applicable) resource requirements,consumables, etc. A description of previous uses of any technologies, if they are alreadyoperational or nearly operational, should be included. A discussion of how they can beapplied to the EJSM should be included to demonstrate their applicability;* A discussion of maturity level of the respondent's technologies in terms of heritage,with supporting evidence for the claimed heritage. An estimate of investments to date;* A discussion of your past experience and capability in designing, developing, anddelivering similar technologies for space missionsInstructionsThe complete RFI including background, description of anticipated requirement, requestedinformation, and instructions for responding may be found at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/    (select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then "Request for Information:NNH09ZDA008L (Radiation Capabilities for the Europa Jupiter System Mission)."Responses to this RFI must be submitted no later than May 22, 2009.Contact PointQuestions concerning this Request for Information should be addressed to Dr. Curt Niebur,Planetary Science Division, Science Mission Directorate, National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, Washington, DC 20546; Telephone: (202) 358-0390; E-mail:curt.niebur@nasa.gov.

<DESC><p>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE <br />RFP Number: HHS-NIH-NIA-SBSS-09-006
<p><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.

An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Within the various laboratories of the National Institute on Aging (NIA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) are several lines of investigational drugs that are not only providing insight into fundamental mechanisms of aging and age-related diseases, but also provide potential targets and agents for therapeutic intervention. This work has resulted in the identification of a number of new chemical entities, which represent lead drug candidates for the treatment of cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, oncologic, and immunological diseases as well as other clinical states associated with the aging process. Initially this work was done under three (3) contracts: N01-AG-3-1008 (Preclinical Toxicology), N01-AG-3-1009 (Synthesis of Lead Compounds), and, N01-AG-3-1011 (Synthesis of Bulk Chemicals and Drugs for Preclinical and Clinical Studies). This program was successfully applied to the identification of (R,R')-fenoterol as a lead drug for the treatment of congestive heart failure and the steps up to the initial "first-into-human" study. The program also indentified a new chemical entity, methoxyfenoterol, as a second generation agent as well as the development of a pharmacophore describing binding to the &#61538;2-adrenergic receptor. This pharmacophore lead to the synthesis of additional, highly selective agents. The present contract will be a continuation of the initial program and will include the development of methoxyfenoterol up to the "first-into-human" stage. The program will also work on the development of other possible lead drug candidates identified in the NIA laboratories including agents active in the Central Nervous System (CNS) and inflammatory diseases following the protocols developed during the first project.</p>
<p><br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: The NIA is planning to procure services in the area of the development of new drug candidates from conception to submission of Investigational New Drug (IND) applications to the FDA. The services are in the following areas: 1) The synthesis and physicochemical characterization of related series of compounds, the structures of which have been determined to be likely to be active at the relevant receptor/target; 2) The screening of synthesized compounds in relevant molecular, cellular, and animal models to determine relative pharmacological activity, the establishment of quantitative structure activity relationships and molecular models necessary to permit the selection of compound(s) for additional studies; 3) The synthesis of selected compound(s) in sufficient quantity under standards of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for use in toxicological evaluations and human studies; and, 4) The evaluation of the acute and chronic toxicity in rodents and dogs of drug candidates including pharmacokinetic study to provide data for interspecies scaling. These drug candidates in the areas of congestive heart failure, neurodegenerative disease, diabetes mellitus, oncologic and immunologic diseases will have toxicological evaluation to the extent that permits filing of an IND to the FDA in order to receive approval to use the drug in humans. For drug candidates selected to be introduced into human, compound stability studies and an appropriate pharmaceutical formulation will be developed.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: All work shall be done as directed by a Work Assignment (WA). The Contractor shall synthesize, purify, characterize, and submit to the NIA, target compounds of high purity and small libraries of analogs of lead compounds as needed. The total number of target compounds to be delivered per year shall be no less than five (5) nor more than 100. A target compound is defined as one that is assigned by the Project Officer for synthesis, purity evaluation or determination of physio-chemical properties such as stability, solubility, and spectroscopic data. The Contractor shall conduct toxicology and pharmacology studies in accordance with the complete protocol requirements developed by the NIA for each agent. The protocols and required studies will be determined based upon each compound's in vitro cytotoxicity, biochemistry and schedule dependence as well as in vitro activity. The Contractor shall be required to perform the following types of studies: 1) Drug Synthesis Phase: Develop synthesis of required compounds and establish identity and purity using analytical methods such as chromatography and spectroscopy (e.g. IR, NMR, MP, MS, or other emerging methodologies designed by the Project Officer). Develop and validate the procedures for the assay of targeted compounds in biological fluids. 2) Pharmacological Screens: Conduct in vitro receptor binding and activity studies in appropriate cell lines and tissues. Determine drug transporter selectivity and function in appropriated cell lines. Determine presystemic and microsomal metabolism using appropriate cell lines, and sub cellular preparations. Conduct mutagenicity and genotoxicity studies according to FDA requirements. Where appropriate, conduct molecular biology studies of the effect of the lead/test compounds on gene and protein expression(s) using standard techniques such as: Western and Northern blotting, confocal microscopy and gene arrays. Determine construction of Quantitative Structure - Activity Relationships (QSAR) and molecular models (such as CoMFA-Models) to describe and predict receptor ligands interactions. 3) Pharmacokinetic Phase: Plasma elimination kinetics shall be determined in one or both of the following species: beagle dogs and rodents, after a single intravenous dose of drug. Other routes and ministrations such as oral, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and intramuscular may be necessary to evaluate as well. Bioavailability of non parenteral routes and plasma clearance rates shall be determined in order to establish the dose required to produce effective drug concentrations and plasma for future toxicity studies. 4) Preliminary Phase: For each drug, establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) in both beagle dogs and rodents. 5) IND Directed Toxicity Phase: For each drug, establish toxicity and safety in relation to drug plasma concentrations or area under the curve in both beagle dogs and rodents. The types of studies in this phase may include the following, but are not limited to: Single or multiple dose schedules such as Dx1, q3hr x 3, 18hr x 15, etc.; Up to 90 days are repeated administration of drug to rodents and/or beagle dogs; Special studies such as cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity and mutagenesis; and, Canine in murine bone marrow toxicity assessment in vitro and correlation with toxicity occurring in vitro. Rat and monkey marrow as necessary for certain agents under consideration.</p>
<p>The desired materials will involve a wide variety of compounds. Methods of synthesis or literature citations will be available for many, but not all WAs. The Contractor shall develop new and/or existing synthetic procedures and process development for scale up to commercial size lots as required. All materials submitted shall be analyzed and checked for identity and purity by accepted procedures. All materials produced or procured shall be accounted for, and will remain Government property, and shall be delivered and distributed as directed by the Project Officer. Appropriate laboratory safety controls and procedures shall be followed in carrying out the activities of this project.</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Office of Contract Operations in support of the Cutter Boat Over-The-Horizon Project Office as a means of conducting market research regarding the state of the market for two (Large and Medium) cutter boat designs. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Unsolicited Proposal, or as an obligation or intent by the USCG to acquire any products and/or services. The USCG does not intend to award a contract as a result of this RFI or otherwise pay for the requested information. The purpose of this RFI is to collect available market information that will be used to assist the USCG in evaluating its options related to its urgent need for cutter boat capability.

This RFI seeks principal cutter boat design particulars and operational features on vessels that are or are not currently in operation and have the potential to meet USCG requirements. Furthermore, these vessels shall meet the USCG requirements with or without significant development (e.g. integrate with parent cutter design). Information submitted must be based on: 1) proven currently in-service vessels that are capable of being built in the United States (US); 2) service vessels that are capable of being licensed for building in the US; or, 3) building a variant of the vessel capable of being licensed in the US. New and unproven (not in service) designs are of interest in this request and will be reviewed. The Cutter boats’ missions will generally occur in both littoral (coastal) and deep water (beyond 50 nautical miles from shore) and performing the following missions: Ports, Waterways, and Coastal Security (PWCS), Search and Rescue (SAR), Drug Interdiction (DRUG), Alien Migrant Interdiction Operations (AMIO), Living Marine Resources (LMR), Defense Readiness (DR) and Other Law Enforcement (OLE). When deployed, operations will generally take place 12 nautical miles or more beyond U.S. shores. However, the parent cutter shall transit and operate for limited periods of time throughout inland defined harbors, canals, or waterways navigable by seagoing vessels. Recognizing that proven designs may not meet all the desired requirements listed in section I of the below listed requirements or that proven designs could possibly be modified to meet the requirements listed below, proven designs within or near the range of characteristics identified in section I of the below listed requirements may be submitted for consideration. The information requested is intended to include, but not be limited to, engineering and operational design details, boat developmental history, operational history, user contacts and other information that would be helpful for making programmatic decisions. Specifically, the requested minimum and desired information is listed in section II of the below listed requirements. Any restrictive markings included on the data shall be clearly marked. In responding to this request, data and information (drawings, documents, tables, graphs, etc.) may be submitted in different formats and media (paper or electronic files). Costs associated with returning information shall be incurred by the provider of such information. Industry is advised that Government’s support contractors (D & P, Whitney, Bradley & Brown Inc, DGIT, ARL, CACI, Analytical Research, EIS and BIG) will be involved with the review of submitted information. If a Government support contractor other than those listed above will be involved with the review of submitted information, each vendor that has responded to this RFI will be notified before their information is provided to the support contractor for review. All Government support contractors required to review the information will be required to submit non-disclosure or confidentiality statements. Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever. The USCG understands that any pricing information submitted under this RFI is an estimate only and is not binding nor constitute a proposal. Responses to this RFI can be submitted to Mrs. Linda Dearing via email (linda.b.dearing@uscg.mil) or hard copy mail no more than 45 days after the RFI’s posting in FedBizOpps. Responses received more than 45 days after the RFI’s posting in FedBizOpps may not be afforded a comprehensive review. Responses shall state if interested in design for the CB-OTH-MK V, CB-OTH-MK IV or both cutter boats, the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. 

NOTE: Industrial Day will take place following the 45 days posting of this RFI, the date has yet to be determined for Industrial Day.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7 (Alaska) intends to award a sole source contract in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5, Section 5.203 and is supplemented with additional information contained within to the Wadsworth Center for conducting analysis of Sea Otter Livers for PBDE levels for up to 5 years.  This study will examine the association between exposure to PBDEs and the disease status of the Alaskan sea otter.  This will be accomplished by determining and comparing hepatic concentrations of PBDEs in sea otters that died of infectious diseases and those that died of noninfectious causes.  The availability of large numbers of archived tissues of Alaskan sea otters, which had been systematically examined for evidence of disease during postmortem investigations and necropsy, provides an opportunity to evaluate the association between PBDE concentrations and cause of mortality.
Negotiations are estimated to occur approximately 15 days following the posting of this notice, with the estimated contract award approximately May 18, 2009.  The Government is contemplating award of a firm fixed price contract with four option years.
This announcement is for information purposes only.  No solicitation is available.  This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to compete this requirement.  A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice and currently available information about the intended recipient, is solely within the discretion of the Government.
Background: The sea otter, once an abundant species with a range spanning from California in the east across the Pacific Rim to the Kuril Islands north of Japan in the west, was hunted to near-extinction in the 18th and 19th centuries for its fur.  It was not until 1911 that the surviving population was legally protected by international law.  The result was several remnant sea otter populations.  Data collected by both the Fish & Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological Survey show that the Alaskan sea otter population in the Aleutians declined by 95% since the mid-1970s, when it numbered between 50,000 and 100,000. From 1992 to 2000 it may have declined by 70%. Today, as few as 6,000 otters may remain in the entire Aleutian chain.The causes of the sea otter decline have been explored by reviewing available data on seaotter reproduction, survival, distribution, habitat, and environmental contaminants. Estes et al.(1998) concluded that the observed sea otter declines were most likely caused by increased adultmortality. Disease, pollution, and starvation may all influence sea otter mortality.  Although several studies have examined the association between exposure to immunosuppressive contaminants and health of sea otters in California (Kannan et al. 1998; Nakata et al. 1998; Kannan et al. 2004a; Kannan et al. 2006a; Kannan et al. 2006b), little is known regarding the accumulation and effects of toxic organic pollutants in sea otters from Alaska.  In attempts to better understand the factors that contribute to high mortality and reduced immunocompetence in Alaskan sea otters, in this study, we propose to examine the concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in otters that died of infectious and non-infectious diseases.  A few earlier studies have compared residue levels of PCBs, PBDEs, and butyltins between healthy and diseased sea otters (Kannan et al. 1998; Nakata et al. 1998; Kannan et al., 2006).Thymic atrophy and splenic depletion were significantly correlated with increased PCB and PBDE levels in harbor porpoises from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea (Beineke et al. 2005).   PBDEs are flame retardants and are used in many household consumer products ranging from television sets and computers to sofas, blankets, and building materials (Hites 2004).  Studies have shown that the concentrations of PBDEs in marine mammals have increased significantly over the last decade (She et al. 2002; Ikonomou et al. 2002; Kajiwara et al. 2004; Johnson-Restrepo et al. 2005a).  PBDEs are also known to affect thyroid hormone homeostasis.This study will examine the association between exposure to PBDEs and the disease status of the Alaskan sea otter.  This will be accomplished by determining and comparing hepatic concentrations of PBDEs in sea otters that died of infectious diseases and those that died of noninfectious causes.  The availability of large numbers of archived tissues of Alaskan sea otters, which had been systematically examined for evidence of disease during postmortem investigations and necropsy, provides an opportunity to evaluate the association between PBDE concentrations and cause of mortality.  Sea otters are unique and valuable sentinels that allow us to evaluate the health of coastal aquatic environments.  The narrow home range, top-level predator status, and voracious appetite make the sea otter a suitable surrogate for human exposure to aquatic sources of environmental contaminants (Kajiwara et al. 2001; Kannan et al. 2004a).  A subset of samples from adult female sea otters will be selected from an archived sample set of >300 beached Alaskan sea otters found freshly dead or dying between 1992 and 2008, along south-central Alaska.  The otters were found terminally ill or dead and carcasses were in good postmortem condition. Necropsies of sea otters were performed at U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Anchorage, AK, for the determination of cause of death.  Sample selection will be based on gender and age, to eliminate these variables as confounding factors.  Additionally, female sea otters will be chosen, because their more localized movement patterns make them more suitable indicators of local sources of pollution.  Based on the cause of death, samples are classified as emaciation, infectious disease and trauma.  Liver will be chosen for analysis for the following reasons.  First, this organ plays a significant role in toxicant processing.  Depending on the availability of brain tissues, we also propose to analyze brain tissues.  Liver samples (~5 g) will be homogenized with anhydrous sodium sulfate (120 g), spiked with the internal standards PCB-30 and PCB-204 (25 ng), and extracted with mixed solvents dichloromethane (300 mL) and hexane (100 mL) using a Soxhlet apparatus for 20 h (Kannan et al. 2004a).  The solvent will be concentrated (11 mL), and an aliquot (1 mL) will be taken for gravimetric determination of fat content.  A second aliquot (5 mL) will be spiked with 13C-labeled PBDEs (10 ng each congener; EO5100; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) and subjected to column chromatography for removal of lipids.  Columns (10 mm i.d.) will be prepared by layering silica gel (2 g, 100-200 mesh), 40% acidic silica gel (1 g), silica gel (1 g), 40% acidic silica gel (1 g), and silica gel (1 g).  Sample extracts will be eluted with 15% dichloromethane in hexane (150 mL).  Samples will be further subjected to lipid removal by treatment with concentrated sulfuric acid, if and when needed.  Sample extracts (2 uL) are injected into a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph interfaced with a Hewlett-Packard 5973 mass spectrometer (GC-MS).  Injections are made in the splitless mode, and samples are separated on a 30 m DB-5 (5 % diphenyl /dimethylpolysiloxane) analytical capillary column with a 250 m i.d. and a 0.25 m film thickness.  The oven temperature program is set to 100 C for 1 min, 10 C/min to 160 C, hold 3 min, and 2.5 C/min to 260 C, hold for 10 min.  The inlet and interface temperatures are set to 270 C and 300 C, respectively.  The MS is operated in an electron impact mode (70 eV) and selected ion monitoring mode (SIM).  PBDE congeners are identified and quantified by SIM at m/z 406, 408; 486, 484; 564, 566; and 642, 644 for tri-; tetra-; penta-; and hexa-BDEs, respectively.  Quantification is based on external calibration standard.  PBDE congener 209 will be analyzed using GC with electron capture detection.In order to assure the quality of the measurements, several steps will be taken.  13C-labeled-PBDEs, one from each homologue group will be spiked into every sample for the calculation of recoveries.  Recoveries of PCB-30 and PCB-204, spiked as surrogate standards prior to extraction will be monitored.   A quantitation limit (LOQ) of 1 ng/g, wet weight, for total PBDEs is determined using this method.  Procedural blanks will be analyzed simultaneously with every batch of five samples as a check for interferences or contamination arising from solvents and glassware. Total PBDEs represent the sum of BDE congeners 47,99,100,153, and 154, 183 and 209. 
Goals: To investigate the potential role of Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PDBEs) in Alaskan Sea Otters that Died of Infectious Diseases and Noninfectious Causes; and to monitor marine pollution in coastal Alaska by means of a sentinel species
Objectives: The objectives of this study are to (1) establish baseline levels of PBDEs in Alaskan sea otters (2) to compare concentrations of PBDEs in sea otters by location, nutritive condition, and through time and (3) to establish an association of PBDE concentrations with infectious and noninfectious mortality categories in sea otters.
Tasks: The contractor shall analyze 50 liver tissues of northern sea otters collected since 1992 through 2009 to further determine the concentrations of PBDEs.  
Deliverables:1.	Results of PBDE analysis in an Excel Spreadsheet. 2.	Interpretation of PBDE results in manuscript form.3.	Guidance on any follow-up analytical work.
Period of Performance for Task order #1: 1 June 2009 through 1 June 2010.  Upon Government acceptance of all deliverables, the contractor can submit their invoice.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accept proposals received.  Award will be made 15 days after publication of this notice.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation.     This announcement is considered a brand name justification for NetApp software SnapVault and SnapMirror. This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG). THIS ACQUISITION WILL BE CONDUCTED UTILIZING EXISTING USPTO'S INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANITY (ID/IQ) CONTRACTS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS, A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  There will not be a  Solicitation released to any other vendors than those stated above.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure NetApp SnapVault and SnapMirror licenses to existing NetApp storage systems in use at the USPTO Alexandria, VA and Boyers, PA facility.  This will allow for the bunkering of SAN and server storage on these NetApp platforms.  These licenses provide native data replication capabilities using existing NetApp hardware.  The use of native data replication tools from the storage vendor is required to achieve the BC/DR goal of bunkering production data.  The purchase of these licenses will allow the USPTO to move forward in the implementation of the BC/DR activity.  There is no other licensed product available that can provide this level of compatibility.  The use of another vendor’s software on the NetApp hardware would void the existing warranties and maintenance agreements with NetApp.

<DESC><p>FBO Notice of Intent to Award a Sole-source Acquisition
<p>MODERNIZE RESERVOIR CONTROL/WATER MANAGEMENT DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS</p>
<p>This is a notification of intent to award a sole-source Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Time and Materials contract to Mr. Michael McCormick, Resource Management Associates, Inc (RMA) of Fairfield, California under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). The contract will provide for programming services associated with continued development, updating and/or modernizing Reservoir Control/Water Management database applications.</p>
<p>This procurement is for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (SWF), Reservoir Control Section (CESWF-EC-HL) who is working in a project management capacity with the Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC), Tulsa District (SWT), Little Rock District (SWL), SPA, Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA), Tarrant Regional Water District (TRWD) and other organizations on several initiatives. The first initiative is to develop decision support tools to replace an out-of-date legacy forecasting system with a new forecasting system centered on HEC-HMS and integrated into CWMS and the Real Time System (RTS). The second initiative is to replace legacy daily, monthly and annual report decision support tools as well as other decision support tools used within water management offices across the country. Services sought include programming in JAVA, C and C++, the accepted standardized programming languages for HEC-HMS, CWMS and RTS. The contract will also involve travel and participation in meetings regarding the initiatives. This contract is estimated to cost $500,000 or less. The period of performance for this contract will not exceed five (5) years from the date of award.</p>
<p>Mr. Michael McCormick, the proposed sole source, authored the original versions of these programs in a different programming language. Because of the highly technical nature of the programming services, any other course of action would result in substantial cost duplication to the government and would create delays of one to two years, reproducing work Mr. McCormick has already performed on the original versions, in fulfilling Reservoir Control Section's requirements. This could significantly damage several functions of the Reservoir Control Section, as they use these programs for vital task information, which is essential to their operation. These costs would not be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>To be eligible to receive a Government contract award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. Register via the CCR internet site at: www.ccr.gov . For further questions or concerns regarding CCR, please contact CCR Assistance at 888-277-2423 Monday thru Friday 8:00am to 6:00pm (EST).</p>
<p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR QUOTATIONS.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Firms intending to provide submittals must submit detailed information indicating their ability to meet the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Responses to this announcement shall be submitted via email to Melanie.M.Hubbard@usace.army.mil . Responses via fax or traditional mail will NOT be accepted.</p>
<p>All inquiries must be received by 3:00pm (CST) Friday, 22 May 2009.</p>

<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs.

This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/.

<DESC><p>The 61st Contracting Squadron, Los Angeles AFB, CA is issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the acquisition of a design and build for 3 turnstile gate with controlled access at Fort Macarthur, San Pedro, California and Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, California. The Government is soliciting for the award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract. This proposed contract is a set-aside under a small business set-aside program. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 238990. The size standard for NAICS 238990 is $14 million.
<p>This project consists of a design and build for 3 turnstile gate with controlled access. Currently at Fort MacArthur, the 30th Street entrance there are no provisions to allow pedestrian traffic through the fenceline if the gate is closed. Also the current gate along the east fence at Fort MacArthur cannot be opened without a key or have a security representative manning the gate. These two gate will provide controlled access through the fence by the use of a turnstile. At Los Angeles Air Force Base, the configuration of the pathways to the north of the Douglas Gate Guardhouse, Building 261, requires the two guards to operate during normal business hours. This gate will provide controlled access just north Building 261 by the use of a tandem turnstile and handicap access gate. The existing south turnstile (Aerospace) at El Segundo near the south-east corner of the base is currently controlled through the Aerospace access control system. This gate will utilize the existing turnstile and power at that location and provide new access controls through the LA AFB access control system. The Performance Period for this project is estimated to be one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after receiving the Notice to Proceed. The magnitude of this project is estimated between $100,000 and $250,000. <br />The evaluation technique to be utilized for the contemplated award of the issued solicitation is Performance Price Trade-Off (PPT). Under PPT, past performance will be evaluated.</p>
<p>Interested parties should register online and subscribe to receive procurement announcements related to this solicitation by entering the website at http://www.fbo.gov. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for release of the solicitation package. To be eligible for contract award, offerors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. Contractors must also submit their representations and certifications at the online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) website at https://orca.bpn.gov. There will be no paper copies of this solicitation available. The RFP will be released using the Electronic Posting System (EPS) available at http://www.fbo.gov. All solicitation information may be obtained through the above referenced website. The Government will not reimburse any interested parties for monies spent to provide a response to the subsequent solicitation notice.

The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(f) Excusable delays. The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement or any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.</p>

The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records.

<p>&nbsp;(t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the</p>
<p>Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the</p>
<p>Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>

As RFID is considered the industry best-practice in improving the efficiency of inventory tracking and management, DSD is looking to begin the second phase of RFID implementation for the IRM Consolidated Bureaus.The request for product and services includes: (i) RFID Metal Mount Tags  OMNI ID Flex tags; (ii) HHR (scanner) application conversion; and (iii) RFID Professional Training and Support.41 USC 253(c)(2), FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency.  This justification is for continuation of previous years services and tags garnered through the same contractor. This would be a Phase 2 implementation, and as DSD is slated to begin with in-scope IT Asset consolidation immediately post the March 15, 2009 DoS reconciliation deadline, we are in an urgent situation and imminent to fall-behind with the IT Consolidation schedule. Thus, the ability to continue with an industry-recognized contractor that has already helped us implement the first phase seems to be the best and most efficient avenue to pursue. Lastly, their quote was vastly less than other competitors we contacted.<BR><BR>

</ol>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">During the 2008 hurricane season two major hurricanes hit the United States; Ike and Gustav.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A massive feeding mission was undertaken due to the immense numbers of the population that were affected in both Louisiana and Texas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Over 4 million meals were prepared and delivered by National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD) members using industrial mobile kitchens.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">In the past, voluntary organizations have been capable of handling these feeding missions and ordering food commodities with aid from donations and volunteers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, in light of the current economic atmosphere, donations have been minimal and voluntary organizations have not been able to assist at the same levels as in the past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore FEMA, under Section 403.b in the Stafford Act, stepped in and took a larger role in assisting with the purchasing and transporting of goods and services to assist the voluntary community achieve success in their missions.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">During Hurricanes Ike and Gustav in 2008, a last minute Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) was developed to procure commodities from two vendors; however, this was a temporary BPA with limited detail in the scope, and was not done through the proper channels within FEMA Acquisitions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">A well planned and maintained BPA for procuring food and feeding related products is needed to ensure that future possible feeding missions are successful.</p>

<li style="tab-stops: list .5in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Scope:</li>
</ol>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">A BPA is being requested as the primary contract method of procuring food and feeding related products for future disaster feeding operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Having multiple vendors available under this BPA would be ideal as the amount of food and feeding related products being requested would be in such high amounts that it would overwhelm the capabilities of one vendor.</p>

</ol>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has a requirement to provide one (1) Continuous Friction Measurement (CFM) System. This competition is unrestricted. All manufacturers of commercial equipment are invited to propose. The NAICS code for this solicitation is 334519. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 52.212-1 apply. The clauses at 52.212-4 and 52.212-5 apply to this acquisition, and will be included in any award resulting from the notice. This solicitation with its documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-32. Full text for these FAR provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.acquisition.gov/far/. All interested parties should submit their offer in accordance with the solicitation.

Background

The FHWA currently administers a Friction Equipment Loan Program to benefit State Highway Agencies.  For those Agencies who are considering changing their friction measurement equipment, the loan program provides a means to evaluate several types of continuous friction measurement systems under typical use conditions, prior to making a procurement decision. The equipment loan program supports the implementation of the AASHTO Friction Guide and the pending FHWA Technical Advisory on Pavement Friction Management.  The new Technical Advisory will expand the type of equipment recommended for use on a friction management program to include continuous friction measurement equipment.

The friction and texture measurement equipment currently deployed through this equipment loan program include:

•	Circular Texture Meter (3 units)
•	Dynamic Friction Tester (3 units)
•	Griptester  (2 units)

The program is administered for the FHWA by private contractors including Burns Cooley Dennis for the CTM and DFT, while Virginia Tech Transportation Institute administers the equipment loan program for the Griptester.  The role of the contractors is to provide for delivery/shipment of the requested devices, provide on—site orientation and continued technical assistance to requestors, as well as routine maintenance of the returned devices.

Under this solicitation, a vehicle–integrated, continuous friction measurement device will be acquired to complement the existing inventory of equipment.
 
Description:

The Continuous Friction Measurement (CFM) System shall consist of a friction testing subsystem and a vehicle subsystem. The CFM System shall have the following minimum characteristics:

•	Performs friction testing in the wheel path, in accordance with ASTM E2340 (0.5mm water depth) using ASTM E1551 tire

•	Performs macrotexture testing in the same wheel path as friction testing in accordance with ASTM E1845 while traveling at 60 mph

•	Friction test subsystem shall be integrated into the vehicle (no trailer deployed systems) 

•	Friction test subsystem shall have a data collection, analysis, storage, and output system consistent with indicated functionality.

•	The vehicle subsystem shall not exceed 16,000 pound GVW

The vehicle subsystem proposed shall with vehicle size, maneuverability, horsepower, torque, and towing capacity.  The friction testing subsystem shall utilize additional test sensors to adequately characterize the friction and macro-texture characteristics of in-service pavement. 

Evaluation Method

Award will be made based on “Best Value” to the Government, using the evaluation criteria listed below. Technical and other factors when combined, are more important than price.

•	Technical capability of system to meet the Government’s requirements as described above

•	Capacity of system to perform testing before requiring refilling of water
 (miles of continuous testing with on-board water supply)

•	Seating capacity of vehicle subsystem

•	Extent of customer support and Terms and Conditions of Warranty

•	Demonstrated track record of performance

•	Overall Price

 
Proposal Instructions

Proposals shall be submitted directly to the Government Contract Specialist listed in this announcement. Proposals shall be in two separate volumes. Volume 1 should include everything, but excluding price. Volume 2 should include pricing only. If emailing your submission, use two separate attachments. 

Proposals should include all information necessary to establish that the Government’s requirements can be met. This can include commercial brochures, test results, specifications, and any other relevant information and/or documentation.  Pay attention to the description of the Government’s requirement, and the method of evaluation. Be sure to include information on warranties, customer support, and proven track record of performance.

Please include a completed copy of the FAR Provisions at 52.212-3 with your offer.

<DESC><p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) Vehicle Safety Hotline ("Hotline") is the primary point of contact for the public to request and report safety defect information including passenger vehicles, heavy trucks, and RVs, or report problems with motor vehicle equipment (e.g., air bags, motorcycle helmets, brakes, or child safety seats) that could affect safety. The information gathered from the Hotline and other sources is evaluated by NHTSA to determine if serious safety problems exist.</p>
<p>The Vehicle Safety Hotline has undergone a major transformation from an operation that merely recorded vehicle-related defects to a one-stop customer-oriented operation that accepts many types of calls related to motor vehicle safety.  The major actions undertaken to transform hotline operations include:  (1) establishing the Hotline as the agency's single point of public contact for safety information; (2) developing, publishing, and monitoring customer service standards (courtesy, timeliness, and accuracy) as performance measurements; (3) publicizing the Hotline number during all NHTSA events; (4) promoting vehicle safety through information dissemination; and (5) expanding the Hotline's infrastructure to handle additional calls in English and Spanish.</p>
<p>This process is a series of tasks that depend on electronic and human resources to provide service to anyone seeking information about motor vehicles, highway safety, and the agency; or to report problems with vehicle equipment (e.g., air bags, brakes or child safety seats). The Hotline provides a toll-free number that consumers can call to talk to a Hotline representative between the hours of 8 a.m. and 810 p.m., Eastern Standard Time (EST), Monday through Friday, or to leave a recorded message at times Hotline representatives are unavailable.  The Hotline can also be contacted by e-mail by going to the NHTSA Web site at www.safercars,gov and www.nhtsa.gov. Based on the type of request, responses to calls are instantaneous or typically mailed the next business day.</p>
<p><strong>Intent</strong></p>
<p>This procurement will be an 8(a) set-aside competitive procurement. This procurement is a Time and Materials (T&amp;M) contract. The NAICS Code and Size Standard is 541519.  The period of performance is estimated at 5 years with Option Periods.</p>
<p><strong>Procurement</strong></p>
<p>Attached is the Solicitation document with all relevant material.&nbsp; All offerors must ensure they follow Sections L &amp; M when submitting proposals.&nbsp; Questions will be accepted until May 6 at 5pm EST.&nbsp; Details for submission are also found in the Solicitation.</p>

Each quotation submitted will be evaluated separately.<br />(f) Reserved<br />(g) Contract award. The Government intends to evaluate quotations as described in FAR 13.106-2. Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government may accept other than the lowest quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received. <br />(h) Reserved<br />(i) Reserved<br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The vendor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its quotation, the annotation ``DUNS'' or ``DUNS +4'' followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the vendor's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.

Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract.

A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.  The offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its offer.  In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its offer.  Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this address: http://www.arnet.gov; FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Feb 2009).

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses in their latest editions apply to this solicitation:   52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Jun 2008).  The following terms and conditions are added as an addendum to this clause:

Note 1:  If submitting other than brand name NB 993, the contractor shall be required to submit for approval a first article lot production in accordance with FAR clause 52.209 which is included in this solicitation.  The first article lot shall include the 100 pairs of tennis shoes (sizes will be provided at contract award).  Approval as used in this paragraph means the contracting officer’s written notification to the contractor accepting the test results of the first article.  The initial delivery order expected to be awarded at the time of award or shortly thereafter, will execute the first article testing requirement.

Note 2:  Initial delivery of no less than a quantity of 1,000 pairs of tennis shoes within 90 days after approval of first article test and delivery thereafter of no less than a quantity of 1,000 tennis shoes every 60 days after issuance of subsequent delivery orders until delivery is complete.

Note 6:  Offerors are limited to providing only one proposal each (i.e., product).

Note 7:  The Government will evaluate proposals and may award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  
(End of addendum)

BASIS FOR AWARD:  In accordance with FAR 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999):  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. 

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

1)  PRODUCT DEMONSTRATION MODELS (PDMs) - will be evaluated for the following:

Conformance with the salient characteristics of the description/specification; pass the Shock Attenuation Test and Forefoot Flexibility Test and visual examinations.

2)  PAST PEFORMANCE – will be evaluated for the following:

Relevance and extent of previous contracts, quality and conformance of supplies/services to contract requirements, timely delivery/performance, customer satisfaction, and cost control.  Past performance information (PPI) utilized in the evaluation will be obtained from contractor references, as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  Contractor references that cannot be contacted will not be considered.  Greater weight (both positive and/or negative) will be given for performance under previous contracts that are more similar in scope, size and complexity to this procurement.  Those offerors with no relevant past performance information will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably, however, an offer with no relevant past performance history may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.

3) Price:  For evaluation purposes, all offerors should submit pricing for maximum ordering quantities of 7,500 pairs for each of the five (5) years.  The offeror’s proposed price will be evaluated but not rated.

Award under this procurement will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Both factors mentioned above are of equal importance and both factors are more important than price.  As technical scores converge, the price grows more important in making the award selection.  The Government may award to other than the lowest priced offeror.  

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should submitted to:

Department of Homeland Security
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602
Washington DC  20593-0001
FAX:  202-475-3904

    (a) Prohibitions.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor’s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor’s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor’s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor’s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor’s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor’s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor’s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor’s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor’s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor’s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor’s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor’s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor’s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor’s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor’s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor?s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor?s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor?s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor?s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor?s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor?s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor?s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor?s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor?s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor?s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor?s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor?s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor?s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor?s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor?s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor?s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor?s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor?s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor?s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor?s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor?s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor?s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor?s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor?s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor?s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor?s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

<DESC>3/3/08 TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THE B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE  SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE  BASE (AFB) DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWER WERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT  BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY  QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES: DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD? The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, ?scrub?) is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or  resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble  Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force  Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew  participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556  ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing  SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision  regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for  implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part  of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to  the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs  being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be  implemented in the Training System.

QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE  SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE  BASE (AFB) DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWER WERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT  BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY  QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES: DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD? The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, ?scrub?) is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or  resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble  Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force  Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew  participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556  ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing  SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision  regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for  implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part  of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to  the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs  being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be  implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

DESCRIPTION: The B-2 Training System RFP is in Final Review.  The B-2 Training System team intends to release the Final RFP, once Business Clearance is approved.  This notice of contract action is required to satisfy FAR 5.2 Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions, specifically 5.203 Publicizing and Response Time.
PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.

************************************************************************************5/12/08
TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

<DESC><p>SOLICITATION #: RFP-CMS-2009-0010 DATE: APRIL 20, 2009 SYNOPSIS: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services intends to negotiate a sole source contract for the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 &ldquo;Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy agency requirements.&rdquo; The contract will be awarded to the Iowa Foundation for Medical Care as a follow-on effort lasting thirty months. The estimated value of this effort is $48,000,000. For the last ten years, IFMC has performed a variety of ADP tasks on behalf of the Medicare Program. At this time they are maintaining the Standard Data Processing Systems and Q-Net Websites. The majority of the applications developed by IFMC for the SDPS involve improving the quality of care for the Medicare beneficiaries. They have a unique understanding of the requirements could also meet the urgent legislative deadlines imposed under three separate public laws. On December 20, 2006, President Bush signed the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRCHA) Division B, Title 1, Section 101, Physician Payment and Quality Improvement which authorizes a financial incentive for eligible professionals to participate in a voluntary quality reporting program. A sole source contract was awarded to IFMC under urgent and compelling circumstances due to the compressed timeline for the system to be developed and operational for the scheduled reporting period. On December 29, 2007, the President signed Public Law 110-173, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (MMSEA), which authorized the continuation of the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative for 2008. On July 16, 2008, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) was signed into effect authorizing provisions relating to the physician services be revised to adjust the formula for payment. It extended the Physician Quality Reporting Systems and provided for incentive payment for reporting measures for group practices on a statistical sample basis. It also required posting on the CMS website the names of successful PQRI reports and established a physician feedback program whereby claims and other data are used for confidential reports to physicians measuring resources utilized in furnishing care. It also included requirements for the GAO to study and report on the program, required the Secretary to report on a physician value-based purchasing transition plan for payment under the Medicare program for covered professional services, and removed all money from the Physician Assistance and Quality Initiative (PAQ) fund. Section 132 of MIPPA provides incentive payments for 2009 through 2013 to successful electronic prescribers. Payment reductions will apply for unsuccessful electronic prescribers. It also defined successful electronic prescribers based on reporting of PQRI electronic prescribing measures or through use of Part D data. The legislation also provided for a significant hardship exemption from the payment reductions for physicians on a case-by-case basis. Any delays in the continued operations and development could compromise the integrity of the payment system in determining accurate payments. This may discourage providers from participating in the PQRI program and prevent CMS from receiving information critical to the quality of care being received by the Medicare beneficiaries. This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. All interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to perform this work within 15 days after posting. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on the response received is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested sources are defined as those companies owned by U.S. citizens and incorporated and located within the fifty (50) United States. The Contracting Officer for this action is Jaime Galvez. He may be contacted via email at jaime.galvez@cms.hhs.gov or by phone at (410) 786-5701. The Contract Specialist is Georgette Vlangas. She may be contacted via email at georgette.vlangas@cms.hhs.gov or by phone at (410-786-8372.</p>

<DESC>POSTED April 23, 2009: QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES
POSTED APRIL 21, 2009: AMENDMENT 0001
The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate changes to Section L.   
PLEASE NOTE: Section L5 remains unchanged, with the time and date for proposal receipt no later than 2pm, May 1, 2009.
POSTED APRIL 1, 2009: The files comprising the SIR are contained in the attached zip file. Go to URL http://www.faa.gov/help/zip_files for assistance in opening the zip file. 
In addition, attached are questions received from industry and FAA responses regarding the Aviation Liability Insurance Brokerage Services Program. The FAA has National contracts for providing air traffic control services at visual flight rules (VFR) control towers. This program is referred to as the Federal Aviation Administration Contract Tower (FCT) program. Acknowledging the devastating effects associated with an aircraft accident, there is a need for the FAA to provide aircraft accident liability insurance coverage at each of the FCT locations. The FAA has established a $10,000,000.00 per occurrence amount for each of the approximately 240 FCT locations. This SIR will procure the brokerage services necessary to obtain the aviation liability insurance. 
Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, www.ccr.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (May 1, 2009).  Reference AMS clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), "if the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."  
In addition, all contractors shall complete and return the Business Declaration Form included in the SIR. 
Proposals must be received by the FAA, no later than 2:00 p.m. EST, Friday, May 1, 2009.  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. This is not a request for offers or proposals.  This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. Information received will be used to determine the availability of technically capable and otherwise responsible firms that would be interested in submitting offers for this anticipated solicitation.

The General Services Administration (“GSA”) Northeast and Caribbean Region is conducting a market survey and is seeking sources for Design-Build services.  The requirements for this opportunity include the Renovation of the Peter W. Rodino Federal Office Building, Newark, New Jersey.  The project will involve: 1) asbestos abatement and renovation of approximately 150,000 gsf, 2) stabilization of precast façade and over-cladding with new glass curtainwall, and 3) mechanical, electrical and plumbing improvements to enhance energy efficiency and water conservation. Design-build is anticipated to begin between February 2010 and March 2010.

The current estimated construction cost range is $100,000,000 to $120,000,000.  The estimated project duration (design and construction) is 48 months (1460 days) after Notice to Proceed (NTP). The North American Industry System (NAICS) code for this effort is 236220 and the Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard is $33.5 million dollars in annual receipts averaged over a concern’s latest three (3) completed fiscal years.

The services for this project will include preparing construction documents, serving as the Architect/Engineer of record for the project and general construction services.  The project will require work to be performed within an occupied Federal office building while minimizing disruptions to the operations of the existing facility.  The existing facility consists of 16 floors, plus basement and subbasement. Eight (8) floors were previously abated and renovated – work on these floors will include non-structural seismic upgrades, limited abatement and limited structural, mechanical, electrical and plumbing upgrades. Eight (8) floors will be fully modernized as part of this project – work on these floors will consist of full abatement and renovation, including installation of spray-on fireproofing at abated areas, bathroom modernization, alterations to the fire protection, fire alarm, mechanical, electrical, lighting, plumbing and structural framing to support the tenant improvements and improve the overall energy efficiency of the building. Mechanical system upgrades will include replacement of chillers, cooling tower, and pumps, and selective relocation of risers.  Exterior work will include selective roof replacement, repairs to the precast concrete façade and addition of a new glass curtainwall “over-cladding” with supplemental framing and reinforcement of the existing structure. 

All offerors responding to this RFP must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before they can be considered for award. Information concerning CCR requirements may be viewed via the Internet at www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.

Companies who have the necessary experience in design build, as well as an interest in this project, should submit a statement of capabilities, which is not a proposal, but rather a short statement regarding the firm’s expertise and experience on design build projects similar in scope to the one described in this notice. Firms should indicate eligibility for SBA programs and whether they are a Small Business, SBA-certified HUBZone, SBA-certified 8(a) or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB). Additional information related to SBA programs can be found at www.sba.gov. 

Interested firms should submit a Written Letter of Interest to Brian Burns, Contracting Officer.  Please EMAIL your response to brian.burns@gsa.gov or mail your response to the General Services Administration, PBS Project Management Division, 2PCB, Attn:  Mr. Brian Burns, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1639, New York, NY 10278 by April 29 , 2009.

These services include preventive medical and dental care and critical medical care.   To meet this requirement, the USMC provides its Medical and Dental Battalions and unit medical personnel with authorized medical and dental supplies and equipment (Class VIII equipment) necessary to treat patients in operational and field environments.  Historically, this service has been managed directly by the Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) Family of Field Medical Equipment (FFME) within PM CBRN Systems.  In an effort to improve these services, and to conserve scarce Marine Corps resources that would otherwise be required to execute this process, PM CBRN Systems has elected to outsource the procurement, supply chain management, and associated support activities through a prime vendor contract to procure equipment contained in the USMC Authorized Medical Allowance Lists (AMALs), Authorized Dental Allowance List (ADALs) and medical kits.  <BR><BR>AMALs and ADALs are highly specialized capability sets comprised of Class VIII (DoD classification for medical materiel to include medical peculiar repair parts) materiel.  The FFME Team, PM CBRN Systems centrally manages and controls the configuration of AMALs, ADALs and medical kits for the Marine Corps.  The USMC currently maintains 30 separate AMALs/ADALs and four medical kits.  Each AMAL/ADAL and medical kit contains a list of specific commercially available equipment, supplies, repair parts, tools, and Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) to provide a specific medical capability.  <BR><BR>The Government requires performance of a broad set of tasks relating to AMAL/ADAL and medical kit procurements and management, including, but not limited to:  <BR>	maintaining awareness of contents and changes to AMAL/ADAL equipment lists<BR>	supply chain management<BR>	online delivery order preparation and total asset visibility system<BR>	procurement of AMAL/ADAL equipment and supplies<BR>	customer support services<BR>	regulatory and safety services<BR>	equipment calibration, maintenance, repair, shelf life and lifecycle management<BR>	Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) warranty management<BR>	meetings and reviews<BR><BR>The Governments contracting strategy entails award of a single prime vendor type contract, 5 years, approximately $100 Million, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) delivery orders for AMAL/ADAL and medical kit equipment, and for overall prime vendor support.  <BR><BR>Technical Point of Contact:  allen.schweizer@usmc.mil<BR><BR>Contracting Point of Contact:  john.conlin3@us.army.mil<BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA in support of the Joint Program Executive Office-Chemical and Biological Defense, Joint Project Manager-Guardian Product Manager-Force Protection Systems (PM-FPS) has a need for Increment 2 of an Automated Installation Entry (AIE) System that can automate the verification, authentication, and entry of personnel and vehicles into military installations. The Increment 2 AIE requirement minimizes the guard force requirements while maintaining or increasing personnel and vehicle throughput. It also enables adaptation of increased authentication requirements at increased threat levels. Increment 2 is totally independent of Increment 1 and will likely result in fielding of Increment 2 AIE systems at approximately 40 military installations throughout the United States. The capability primarily consists of integrated commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products. The Government anticipates releasing a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about May 28, 2009 that will be open for thirty (30) days. It is anticipated that the RFP will result in a single-award, Firm-Fixed-Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract. The scope-of-work under this contract will include design, fielding, testing, training, and interim logistics support. The Government anticipates that the awarded contract will be for a one-year base period with four (4) one year options for a total estimated maximum contract value of $182 million. The estimated award date is August 31, 2009. This procurement is a full and open competition with small business subcontracting requirements.<BR><BR>Comments related to this synopsis should be submitted via email no later than 03:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on Friday, May 15, 2009 to the following Natick Contracting Division contact David.W.Mark@us.army.mil

<DESC><p>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to issue a solicitation within the next thirty (30) days for a Warrior Wellness Program to improve the Special Operations Wounded Warrior recovery outcome by early introduction of casualty mentors and providing awareness regarding motivating activities available that boost their confidence and self esteem to better compete for wounded warrior friendly employment opportunities developed through community outreach and employment network development.</p>
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation announcement only. Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available, and no formal requests for proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement is currently available. Requests for the same will be disregarded.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: A solicitation 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business is being considered by the Government. However, no formal acquisition strategy decision has been made at this time.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance of the program would begin upon contract award in the forth quarter of FY 2009 and run for a twelve month period. It is envisioned that a contract would be established at time of initial award allowing four (4) additional option periods in the contract. The anticipated period of performance, inclusive of all options would be from time of contract award through five (5) years.<br /><br />Any resulting solicitation will call for a Contractor to design, develop, and implement a Warrior Wellness Program addressing the following:</p>
<p>Mentorship Program: Develop confidence in hospitalized, but stable casualties and their families by increasing recuperation process awareness and hope in the future through long-term positive relationships with mentors of similar injuries.</p>
<p>Wellness: Increase the wounded warrior's, families', and hospital staff's awareness of existing quality of life programs through distribution of information and by collaborating with medical treatment facility therapy centers.</p>
<p>Community Outreach: Educate community leaders, businesses, and civic organizations where casualties transition on specific interests and needs of returning wounded warriors to establish a solid foundation for casualty's reintegration into the community.</p>
<p>Resource Networks: Develop a community resource network to capitalize on the success of the mentorship, wellness, and community outreach programs. The Contractor shall also provide access to employment opportunities and community resources further enhancing the special operations wounded warrior's recovery outcome.</p>
<p>Operational Health Advanced Training Program: Provide a program to improve the physical and mental abilities of the wounded warriors returning to active duty with personalized military/tactical performance training in order to give them additional tools to succeed within the military environment.</p>
<p>Advocacy: Educate wounded warriors on available benefits/resources, and interact with Government agencies on their behalf in order to optimize their benefits.</p>
<p>The overall performance objectives include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>a. Severely injured casualties and families verbalize a greater understanding of the recovery "way-ahead" and demonstrate improved recovery rate due to mentor support.</p>
<p>b. Greater casualty involvement in outside activities that have been facilitated through Warrior Wellness Program.</p>
<p>c. A recognized decrease in unemployment rate of casualties leaving military service.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have the ability to provide support identified at various locations within the United States as directed by the Government. However, it is anticipated that the primary place of performance will be at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington D.C. The secondary place of performance is anticipated to be Brooke Army Medical Center located at Fort Sam Houston, TX.</p>
<p>Potential sources must possess an active Facility Clearance (FCL) or be eligible to obtain an FCL at the SECRET level.</p>
<p>This procurement is 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business. <br />Questions concerning this pre-solicitation announcement may be directed to Contracting Officer Dr Joseph R Daum, email daumj@socom.mil phone 813-282-8795 ext.6110.</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Office of Contract Operations in support of the Cutter Boat Over-The-Horizon Project Office as a means of conducting market research regarding the state of the market for two (Large and Medium) cutter boat designs. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Unsolicited Proposal, or as an obligation or intent by the USCG to acquire any products and/or services. The USCG does not intend to award a contract as a result of this RFI or otherwise pay for the requested information. The purpose of this RFI is to collect available market information that will be used to assist the USCG in evaluating its options related to its urgent need for cutter boat capability.

This RFI seeks principal cutter boat design particulars and operational features on vessels that are or are not currently in operation and have the potential to meet USCG requirements. Furthermore, these vessels shall meet the USCG requirements with or without significant development (e.g. integrate with parent cutter design). Information submitted must be based on: 1) proven currently in-service vessels that are capable of being built in the United States (US); 2) service vessels that are capable of being licensed for building in the US; or, 3) building a variant of the vessel capable of being licensed in the US. New and unproven (not in service) designs are of interest in this request and will be reviewed. The Cutter boats’ missions will generally occur in both littoral (coastal) and deep water (beyond 50 nautical miles from shore) and performing the following missions: Ports, Waterways, and Coastal Security (PWCS), Search and Rescue (SAR), Drug Interdiction (DRUG), Alien Migrant Interdiction Operations (AMIO), Living Marine Resources (LMR), Defense Readiness (DR) and Other Law Enforcement (OLE). When deployed, operations will generally take place 12 nautical miles or more beyond U.S. shores. However, the parent cutter shall transit and operate for limited periods of time throughout inland defined harbors, canals, or waterways navigable by seagoing vessels. Recognizing that proven designs may not meet all the desired requirements listed in section I of the below listed requirements or that proven designs could possibly be modified to meet the requirements listed below, proven designs within or near the range of characteristics identified in section I of the below listed requirements may be submitted for consideration. The information requested is intended to include, but not be limited to, engineering and operational design details, boat developmental history, operational history, user contacts and other information that would be helpful for making programmatic decisions. Specifically, the requested minimum and desired information is listed in section II of the below listed requirements. Any restrictive markings included on the data shall be clearly marked. In responding to this request, data and information (drawings, documents, tables, graphs, etc.) may be submitted in different formats and media (paper or electronic files). Costs associated with returning information shall be incurred by the provider of such information. Industry is advised that Government’s support contractors (D & P, Whitney, Bradley & Brown Inc, DGIT, ARL, CACI, Analytical Research, EIS and BIG) will be involved with the review of submitted information. If a Government support contractor other than those listed above will be involved with the review of submitted information, each vendor that has responded to this RFI will be notified before their information is provided to the support contractor for review. All Government support contractors required to review the information will be required to submit non-disclosure or confidentiality statements. Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever. The USCG understands that any pricing information submitted under this RFI is an estimate only and is not binding nor constitute a proposal. Responses to this RFI can be submitted to Mrs. Linda Dearing via email (linda.b.dearing@uscg.mil) or hard copy mail no later than 31 March 2009. Responses received after 31 March 2009 may not be afforded a comprehensive review. Responses shall state if interested in design for the CB-OTH-MK V, CB-OTH-MK IV or both cutter boats, the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. 

NOTE: Industrial Day will take place approximately 45 days following the posting of this RFI, the date has yet to be determined for Industrial Day.

<DESC>The US Coast Guard invites interested parties to attend an Industry Day Conference to acquaint potential offerors with aspects of an upcoming acquisition of Cutter-based boats.  The Industry Day event will be on 13 May 2009 at 0900 at the Westin Hotel located at National Harbor, Maryland  20745.  

Specifically, the Coast Guard intends to procure a large (11 meter) boat for a variety of Over-the-Horizon operations (CB-OTH Mark V) and a medium size (7 meter) boat (CB-OTH Mark IV) for the same purposes.  A Request for Information seeking sources for this procurement was posted in FedBizOpps March 26, 2009 under the title “Request for Information by the U.S. Coast Guard for Proven Cutter Boat Designs, HSCG23-09-R-2DB011.” The posting is included below.

26 March 2009 RFI: 

This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Office of Contract Operations in support of the Cutter Boat Over-The-Horizon Project Office as a means of conducting market research regarding the state of the market for two (Large and Medium) cutter boat designs. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Unsolicited Proposal, or as an obligation or intent by the USCG to acquire any products and/or services. The USCG does not intend to award a contract as a result of this RFI or otherwise pay for the requested information. The purpose of this RFI is to collect available market information that will be used to assist the USCG in evaluating its options related to its urgent need for cutter boat capability.

This RFI seeks principal cutter boat design particulars and operational features on vessels that are or are not currently in operation and have the potential to meet USCG requirements. Furthermore, these vessels shall meet the USCG requirements with or without significant development (e.g. integrate with parent cutter design). Information submitted must be based on: 1) proven currently in-service vessels that are capable of being built in the United States (US); 2) service vessels that are capable of being licensed for building in the US; or, 3) building a variant of the vessel capable of being licensed in the US. New and unproven (not in service) designs are of interest in this request and will be reviewed. The Cutter boats’ missions will generally occur in both littoral (coastal) and deep water (beyond 50 nautical miles from shore) and performing the following missions: Ports, Waterways, and Coastal Security (PWCS), Search and Rescue (SAR), Drug Interdiction (DRUG), Alien Migrant Interdiction Operations (AMIO), Living Marine Resources (LMR), Defense Readiness (DR) and Other Law Enforcement (OLE). When deployed, operations will generally take place 12 nautical miles or more beyond U.S. shores. However, the parent cutter shall transit and operate for limited periods of time throughout inland defined harbors, canals, or waterways navigable by seagoing vessels. Recognizing that proven designs may not meet all the desired requirements listed in section I of the below listed requirements or that proven designs could possibly be modified to meet the requirements listed below, proven designs within or near the range of characteristics identified in section I of the below listed requirements may be submitted for consideration. The information requested is intended to include, but not be limited to, engineering and operational design details, boat developmental history, operational history, user contacts and other information that would be helpful for making programmatic decisions. Specifically, the requested minimum and desired information is listed in section II of the below listed requirements. Any restrictive markings included on the data shall be clearly marked. In responding to this request, data and information (drawings, documents, tables, graphs, etc.) may be submitted in different formats and media (paper or electronic files). Costs associated with returning information shall be incurred by the provider of such information. Industry is advised that Government’s support contractors (D & P, Whitney, Bradley & Brown Inc, DGIT, ARL, CACI, Analytical Research, EIS and BIG) will be involved with the review of submitted information. If a Government support contractor other than those listed above will be involved with the review of submitted information, each vendor that has responded to this RFI will be notified before their information is provided to the support contractor for review. All Government support contractors required to review the information will be required to submit non-disclosure or confidentiality statements. Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever. The USCG understands that any pricing information submitted under this RFI is an estimate only and is not binding nor constitute a proposal. Responses to this RFI can be submitted to Mrs. Linda Dearing via email (linda.b.dearing@uscg.mil) or hard copy mail no later than 31 March 2009. Responses received after 31 March 2009 may not be afforded a comprehensive review. Responses shall state if interested in design for the CB-OTH-MK V, CB-OTH-MK IV or both cutter boats, the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. 

NOTE: Industrial Day will take place approximately 45 days following the posting of this RFI, the date has yet to be determined for Industrial Day.

This special legislation authorized the Secretary to determine the appropriate reimbursement for these services. To learn more about the Fee Program access http://www.nonvacare.va.gov/CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAll claims pricing done by the VA systems described below may be sent to re-pricing agent to see if they can provide a better price for the service. Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS)The pricing transactions for IPPS are created by VistA (The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture) system using either data previously entered into VistA Fee (from Fee Basis Invoice file) or data entered electronically by a user and are processed using Medicare Code Editor (3M product), MS-DRG Grouper (CMS product - Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services), PPS Pricer (CMS product), and COBOL interface programs (developed in-house) on z/OS Enterprise Server.  The Pricer reports and Reject reports are transmitted to each station (over 170 VA Medical Centers located nation-wide) three times a day.  The current system can process transactions using proper schedules/versions as old as fiscal year 1998.  All pricing results are saved in Fee History file and available for audit purposes.Outpatient and Inpatient AncillaryThe VistA Fee Basis software has two built-in schedules for pricing outpatient and inpatient ancillary claims.  It contains the Medicare Physician Fee schedule (RBRVS) and the VA Fee schedule (75th percentile).  If the service is provided under an existing vendor contract, then the VA pays the contracted amount.  If it is not provided under a current contract and is subject to the Medicare Physician Fee schedule (RBRVS), then the amount from that schedule is paid.  If it is not subject to RBRVS, the VA Fee schedule is used assuming there was an amount calculated for the fiscal year for that service on that schedule.

The acquisition and management of these services are centralized under the Office of Service-wide, Policy, Directives, and Electronic Research (SPDER). The IRS has a wide range of diverse users with different and unique tax, legal, business, and news research requirements.

This improves the quality of cases, assists in the fair application of the laws, and helps front line assistors resolve taxpayer questions.  Users of these research materials are primarily:  Customer Service Representatives, Revenue Officers, Tax Auditors, Appeals employees, Estate and Gift Tax Attorneys, Employee Plans Specialists, Exempt Organizations Specialists, and Librarians.
Three award groups were identified:  Award Group 1 (Portable CD Rom Tax Service); Award Group 2 (Tax Research Service); and Award Grouo 3 (Comprehensive Resarch Services).
