<DESC><p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Texas Medical Foundation Health Quality Institute (TMF) to procure services and tools to CMS in support of the agency's efforts to reduce Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) improper payments in accordance with the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002, (IPIA). TMF developed the innovative First-look Analysis Tool for Hospital Outlier Monitoring (FATHOM) and Programs to Evaluate Payment Patterns Electronic Report (PEPPER). TMF will provide FATHOM/PEPPER to CMS, fiscal intermediaries (FIs), Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs), other CMS contractors/entities, and inpatient acute short-term and long-term care hospitals/providers. The information provided by the TMF FATHOM/PEPPER is a valuable unique data analysis and educational tool that supports CMS' program integrity and Medical Review (MR) efforts and continued distribution of the PEPPERs to hospitals further helps to facilitate proactive monitoring that is necessary to prevent inappropriate payments. <br />Because these programs were developed by TMF, they have the unique programming code, historical background, subject matter knowledge, and complex statistical and data analysis expertise to generate the reports. Therefore, TMF is the only source capable of updating and testing the programming code and providing the necessary training and support required. See draft Statement of Work (SOW) for additional information.<br />This acquisition will be conducted under other than full and open competition in accordance with the authority of 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice. Organizations who believe they have the capability to meet the requirements described herein are encouraged to submit a capability no later than close of business on July 10, 2009. Capability statements shall be limited to two (2) single-spaced pages and shall be submitted via email to Stacey.Walker@cms.hhs.gov. If receipt is not acknowledged within one business day, you are encouraged to follow up to ensure receipt. If, upon review of any submissions, the Government deems TMF to be the only capable source, CMS will proceed with negotiations to issue a contract to TMF without further notice.</p>

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>SEE ATTACHMENT (SPECIFICATIONS FOR HP EQUIPMENT) FOR SPECIFICATIONS AND QUANTITY FOR EACH PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.<BR><BR>The Office of International Claims and Investment Disputes (L/CID) within the Office of the Legal Advisor has within its closed network configuration 4 Hewlett Packard Servers. All 4 servers are Model ML-370 and comprise the core network services for L/CID.This office has submitted a request to purchase 6 new HP servers of various configurations; HP Tape Library system; HP Laserjet printer and HP backup and library software. Three of the new servers will be dedicated to a Test configuration containing our core application Documentum. The 3 new servers are part of a configuration change where Documentum data currently housed on IBM AIX servers will be moved to the HP infrastructure running Windows software and the SQL Server database.  This move will allow the IDMAS system within LCID to comply with U.S. State Department IT CCB guidelines for hardware and software products. The new HP equipment will fit within our current HP architecture (which follows State Department guidelines) for strict cohesive compatibility with existing equipment and allow for the centralized backup library to protect the data contained on these servers. The requested printer is a high performance printer that will be used to print thousands of PDF files and Tiff images representing exhibits and briefs to support this offices mission. Documentum is the core application within IDMAS (Integrated Document Management and Analysis System) that is used by L/CID and supports their mission which is to represent the United States in a multi-billion dollar claim filed by the Government of Iran against the United States (Case B/1) before the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in the Hague. The case involves Irans purchase of defense articles and services under 1126 separate contracts as part of its foreign Military Sales (FMS) program in the 1970s. IDMAS is a tool that enables L/CID to analyze the nearly 2 million lines of billing data ($7.5 billion in total) that form the basis of Irans challenges to these contracts and to match up millions of pages of FMS documents as potential evidence to refute Irans challenges. IDMAS is critical to all aspects of litigation support for the United States defense in this case, including the identification, inventory, organization, analysis and preparation of U.S. evidence and data to support the U.S. position. IDMAS supports the work of a large and varied team of users at multiple worksites throughout the country  attorneys, paralegals, DOD auditors, military service technical personnel, and DoD contractors.  Any disruption in service profoundly impacts this office and user community.<BR><BR>Compatibility with existing servers; cohesive network operations; performance of Servers and Printers; and following U.S. State Department IT CCB guidelines are the reasons that we request purchase of the HP Brand Name for the equipment requested in requisition number 1004-902106. Our request for HP Name Brand purchase applies to the following items in the requisition:
	HP Proliant DL360 G5 Server and its specified configuration (for WEB Sphere)	HP Proliant DL385 G5 High Performance Model Server and its specified configuration (for SQL Server)	HP Proliant DL580 G5 Server and its specified configuration (for Content Server)	HP Proliant DL360 G5 Server and its specified configuration (for Primary Active Directory Server)	HP Proliant DL380 G5 Server and its specified configuration (for Mail Exchange)	HP Proliant DL385 G5p High Performance Server and its specified configuration (for File Server)	HP StorageWorks MSL2024 Tape Library Backup System and its specified configuration	HP Laserjet 9050 Printer Series and its specified configuration	HP Data Protector Backup Software and its specified configuration<BR><BR>

FDA intends to solicit this requirement as a full and open competitive requirement.  

The solicitation will be available for download on or about July 8, 2009 and may be accessed through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website: https://www.fbo.gov.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Dr. Kaluzny has the
background and expertise to make an objective evaluation of DCPs large scale
alliance type programs. He has no vested interest in making a case one way or
the other. He has also been associated with both the NCI and the DCP in a
variety of roles for many years. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In order to do an evaluation,
we need someone who knows and understands the external review evaluation
process as well as the Division programs and staff. Dr. Kaluzny has this
expertise and understanding. His research has focused on organizational factors
affecting program implementation and change in a variety of health care
organizations, with specific emphasis given to cancer treatment and prevention
and control, continuous quality improvement initiatives in both organizational
and primary care settings, and most recently, the study of alliances within
health care. In all these endeavors, a major focus has been to strengthen the
science base of policy and practice. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">He has worked closely with
the Division as a consultant on restructuring the organization. Dr. Kaluzny has
offered expert advice to the DCP for many years. Specifically, he has conducted
an internal review of the DCP OSRGs that administer the DCP Early Phase
Clinical Trials Consortia Program and thus already has a working knowledge of
the program. Thus he is uniquely poised to conduct the external review to
follow up on the internal assessment. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">During the past 20 years Dr.
Kaluzny&rsquo;s continued participation in DCP retreats, meetings, presentations,
analyses and evaluations has given him a unique insight into the DCP staff and
programs. He is the only known external expert who has been involved in all
aspects of the division&rsquo;s growth and oversight. Therefore, Dr. Kaluzny is the
only know contractor, to the NCI who can perform the requirement.</span></p>

<RESPDATE>070809
<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Genetics Branch plans to procure on a sole source basis, the Human Methylation27 v 1.0 Assay Kit with Illumina, Inc; 9885 Towne Center Drive; San Diego, California 92121.

The supplies are herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-(b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

The purpose of this requirement is for the NCI Genetics laboratory to undertake a micoarray genotyping project to identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP’s) and investigate the role that specific genes or groups of genes play to influence carcinogenesis and cancer progression in tumor and cancer cell line samples. The Illumina platform provides the most complete, accurate, and detailed analysis of the specimens. The HumanMethylation27 v1.0 Assay Kits consist of 50-mer oligos immobilized on microbeads embedded in an array format. They are manufactured on custom slides and contain >370,000 target loci. The proposed microarrays will be analyzed and scanned on the existing Illuminabeadchip scanner (NIH # 1558959, serial number S149) located in the Genetics lab.

The Illumina Human HumanMethylation27 v1.0 Assay Kits are an advanced approach to addressing reproducibility and quality issues in microarray data. Because of the unique approach of using micro-beads as microarray targets, it is possible to hybidize to 30-40 replicate targets (the in-house printed slides are currently hybridizing to only a single target). By hybridizing to replicate targets, the lab can average data, which will provide reproducibility and quality never before possible. Further, due to the high density of the micro-beads, whole genome arrays are not possible on a single slide. In fact, multiple arrays (8) are manufactured on a single slide allowing multiple consecutive experiments to be performed, reducing labor and reagent cds. 

Illumina is the sole source offering HumanMethylation27 v1.0 Assay Kit format that are scannable on the BeadArray scanner. They are manufactured on custom slides and contain >3 tang loci. Each oligo on the beadchip is present at a 3l fold redundancy for a statistically powerful result unavailable from any other manufacturer. The SNP Genotyping Beadchip arrays allow analysis of both whole genomic copy number alterations and loss Sheterozygosity in the same analysis. Illumina's beadchip arrays are the only arrays, which are quality controlled at the manufacturer through a process of iterative hybridization that prequalifies all the elements on the array as being 100% functional. For these reasons, there is no other source known to the NCI who can supply the necessary supplies to the Genetics lab.

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can meet this requirement. One (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 a.m. ET on July 8, 2009. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to Ashley Virts: virtsa@mail.nih.gov. It is the vendor’s responsibility to ensure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractor must have valid, updated registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). Please reference NCI-90114-AV on all correspondence.

<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB) plans to procure family studies support on a sole source basis with Dilys Parry, 6311 Friendship Court, Bethesda, MD 20817.</p>
<p>Period of performance shall be for twelve months from date of award with one, one year option period.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541712 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a medical geneticist who will provide guidance and recommendations for mutational analysis of constitutional DNA from sporadic chordoma patients; oversee the ascertainment, clinical evaluation, specimen procurement from and follow-up of chordoma patients and at risk relatives from new chordoma families, and sporadic chordoma patients and selected relatives from other groups who are likely to have an increased genetic predisposition to chordoma; compile and analyze clinical and epidemiologic data obtained on the new chordoma families and other groups of high risk chordoma patients; provide recommendations and guidance on gene mapping and other types of molecular studies using specimens from chordoma families and sporadic chordoma patients including those at increased genetic risk of chordoma; and contribute to analysis and interpretation of results of these studies, and manuscript development and  publication.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>The contractor shall be a geneticist with board certification as a Ph.D medical geneticist and more than 10 years of experience in the ascertainment, clinical evaluation, counseling and follow-up of individuals with familial chordoma and with sporadic chordoma, including those who may have a genetic predisposition to chordoma, and their close relatives.  The contractor must have at least 10 years of experience in leading and guiding clinical and gene mapping studies of families with preneoplastic disorders.</p>
<p>Dilys M. Parry provides support for high quality clinical and gene mapping studies of patients and families at increased risk for cancer.  Dr. Parry has conducted research directed towards delineating syndromes and mapping genes that predispose to cancer. Her role in these studies included identifying patients and families of interest, obtaining and interpreting individual and family medical histories, delineating and arranging appropriate diagnostic studies and the procurement of research specimens, directing and participating in the clinical evaluation of family members, providing genetic counseling to affected and at risk family members and analyzing the data from the studies and preparing manuscripts for publication.  Dr. Parry directed studies that led to the identification and cloning of the gene for neurofibromatosis 2, delineated the spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with NF2 and elucidated correlations between the specific types of mutations in the NF2 gene and clinical findings.  Over a period of 10 years, Dr. Parry applied the approaches she used on NF2 to familial chordoma:  this led to the identification and clinical evaluation of 4 chordoma families and resulted in mapping a gene for the disorder to chromosome 7q.  Dr. Parry developed the Familial Chordoma website, and initiated and conducted the chordoma studies with SEER registries and the Department of Radiation Oncology at MGH.  Dr. Parry has collected and evaluated the largest group of chordoma families in the world. All of the families know and trust her, and continue to participate in the research because of the close personal bond they have with her.</p>
<p>Dr. Parry's working relationship with the NCI and with extramural researchers on familial chordoma, her previous involvement in and understanding of the research and her in-depth knowledge of clinical aspects of familial and sporadic chordoma are unique assets that no other known contractor could provide.  In addition, she is currently credentialed as Ph.D. medical geneticist by the NIH Clinical Center to be involved in patient care.  Unacceptable delays would result if training of another medical geneticist were required before the study could be conducted. There is no other medical geneticist who possesses the experience, expertise and detailed knowledge of these studies needed to allow him/her to immediately undertake the tasks covered by this procurement.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The National Cancer Institute
(NCI) carries out studies to characterize and quantify cancer risks associated
with ionizing radiation exposures, improve radiation dosimetry, elucidate
biological mechanisms of radiation carcinogenesis, and study factors that may
modify the carcinogenic action of radiation.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 1982, the REB and the University
of Minnesota initiated a cohort study
of cancer incidence and mortality among 146,022, primarily female (73%), U.S.
radiologic technologists (USRT) to quantify radiogenic risks for protracted low
dose exposures and to determine the applicability of current radiation risk
estimates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Other studies of medical
radiation workers have examined substantially smaller, mostly male, populations
of radiologists and radiologic technologists.<span>&nbsp; </span>Unique features of the USRT cohort are occupational radiation dose
estimates and personal radiation dose scores for each participant (with
confirmatory documentation from a large biodosimetry study); historic solar
ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure obtained by questionnaire and residential
ambient solar UVR estimated exposures obtained from 1978-2008 satellite data
for each subject; substantial numbers of technologists known to have performed
or assisted with emerging and rapidly increasing (<em>e.g.</em>, fluoroscopically-guided and nuclear medicine) radiologic
procedures; ascertainment of non-melanoma skin cancers; and participants from

Figley's expertise on Compassion Stress Management is necessary to train Naval medical personnel to focus on the professional's self-care, and to reduce the secondary impact of working with the traumatized population.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Note that these same costs may not be factored in when evaluating whether it is most advantageous to the Government to remain in the current lease location. The building must be located in commercial office district with attractive, professional surroundings and a prevalence of contemporary design and/or tasteful rehabilitation in current use. Streets and public sidewalks must be well maintained. The location should provide regularly scheduled public transportation and employee parking within convenient walking distance of the offered building sufficient to cover commuting needs of employees.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Pacific Southwest Area REX, has a requirement for 7 Memberships to the Palmyra Atoll Research Consortium for up to 180 man-days to conduct research and monitoring  for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and PARC for restoration and preservation of Palmyra Atoll natural resources and to develop and implement restoration and conservation tools for adaptation to seal level rise that will be applicable to other Pacific islands. Initial Period of Performance:  1 July 2009 - December 31, 2009, to include an option period of:  January 1, 2010 - December 31, 2010.
The USGS - Pacific Southwest Area REX, use the research conducted at Palmyra Atoll to increase public understanding of coral reef ecology, island biology, and coastal conservation practices.  These efforts increase knowledge and enhance decision - support tools, leading to better management of coastal systems in the United States and around the world.  Palmyra is a relatively pristine coral reef atoll, located in the central Pacific about 1,000 miles southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii, and managed by the Department of the Interior.  The Palmyra Atoll Research Consortium (PARC), is a partnership research conservation, and education institutions that conducts innovative, interdisciplinary work on the natural systems of Palmyra Atoll and the Central Pacific.  Due to the remote location and restricted access, the atoll serves as a unique natural laboratory for environmental monitoring and research.  Studies span the realms of both land and sea, from microbes to ecosystems, focusing on linkages across geographies and scales.  Participation in PARC provides support for operations of the laboratory facility, no cost stays at the island's research facilities, and access to laboratory and office facilities, thereby enabling USGS scientists to conduct research on Palmyra that would otherwise not be possible.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE MEMPHIS DISTRICT IS FOR TOPOGRAPHIC, HYDROGRAPHIC, AND GPS SURVEYING AND MAPPING. Negotiations shall begin with the top ranked firm.  Should a need be identified for a subsequent contract, or if negotiations with a firm for a contract are unsuccessful, negotiations shall begin with the next-ranked firm which has not been offered a contract or negotiation.  There is no implied guarantee that every firm on the list will receive a request for proposal, enter into contract negotiations, or be awarded a contract.  If more than one contract is awarded under this solicitation, task orders will be issued to A-E firms according to the following criteria: (1) so that the Government may most effectively utilize the contract time and money requirements, the first contract awarded will have priority; (2) the Government, in collaboration with the A-E firm, will evaluate the current workload of the firm to determine the firm's current capacity/capability to perform additional tasks; the Government will make the final decision; (3) the Government will consider the A-E firm's efficiency, experience, quality of work, and performance on previous task orders; (4) equitable distribution of work; and (5) other relevant factors.  The proposed procurement(s) listed herein will be set aside for small business concerns and submittals from only small businesses will be considered.  A firm is considered to be a small business concern if the firms average annual receipts from the preceding three fiscal years do not exceed $4.5 Million.  Firms with demonstrated specialized experience, competence and qualifications pertinent to survey engineering, geodetic surveying, land and boundary surveying, hydrographic surveying, mapping (Microstation and InRoads capability required) and related services are desired for consideration.

PROJECT INFORMATION: Work areas will normally be within the boundaries of the Memphis District (which includes portions of AR, IL, KY, MO, MS, and TN) but work assignments may be made in other Districts.  The first contract is anticipated to be awarded in November 2009, with the contract period of service not to exceed three years from the contract award date, or expenditure of the contract amount, whichever occurs first.  Award of any subsequent contracts will be based on projected District workload.  Work to be performed is subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders with no one task order to exceed $1,000,000 nor the accumulated total of task orders to exceed $3,000,000 during the three year term of the contract.  3.

ARS is conducting a market survey to identify the availability and interest of qualified Small, Small Disadvantaged, Small Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Historically Underutilized Business Zones, and certified 8(a) firms as potential sources of construction for Replacement of Electrical Systems in Buildings 3 and 4 at the National Animal Disease Center in Ames, Iowa.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238210 with a size standard of $14 million.
The ARS has a requirement for construction of the Electrical System Replacement of Buildings 3 and 4 at the National Animal Disease Center in Ames, Iowa.  These buildings were constructed in the late 1950s and are approximately 50,000 gross square feet.  They each house large species of farm animals used in research programs.  They have had some routine Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and finish upgrades performed.  The electrical gear and distribution is for the most part original equipment which is difficult to maintain or obtain parts for.  
The buildings consist of several wings which house animal programs.  During this electrical project, the buildings will remain in service with the wings vacated one or two at a time for the work to proceed.  The scope includes re-feeding the buildings from the new campus distribution system, replacement of the distribution transformers, replacement of main electrical gear, replacement of motor control centers, and replacement of distribution panels, feeder circuits, branch circuits and devices.  The distribution transformers, main switchgear and motor control centers shall be installed in new locations to allow the building to remain operational throughout construction.  As individual wings are vacated, the branch panels, wiring and devices shall be replaced in the same location.  
The nature of the facilities requires redundant feed from the campus system and redundant main gear.  The campus utilizes 2 sets of feeders and a Power Monitoring and Control System (PMCS) to achieve either automatic or manual transfer between the redundant systems.  
This requirement includes the addition of advanced electrical metering for building feeder-level sub-metering, penthouse lighting, egress lighting, animal room lighting timers, UPS back-up for animal room lighting, lightening protection, and outlets in the laboratories, animal rooms and hallways.  Work includes data communication in the laboratories, offices and hallways and a fire detection/alarm system.
Asbestos Containing Materials (ACMs) are prevalent throughout the utility spaces between ceilings and attic floors.  The scope of work will include asbestos removal and/or abatement.  
Total construction cost is estimated between $5 and $10 million.
Interested firms are invited to respond to this announcement by providing the following information:  a) geographical location(s) of major and satellite offices; b) business size (large or small) and type of firm (8(a) concerns, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned, or service disabled veteran  or other eligible veterans); c)company literature/documentation supporting experience in electrical  work of this size and scope; d) experience in successfully phase projects;  and e) bonding capacity and name of bonding company.  NO SOLICITATION EXISTS.  THIS REQUEST IS INTENDED ONLY TO IDENTIFY SOURCES OF CONSTRUCTION SERVICES.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this sources sought announcement or to otherwise pay for the information requested.  The deadline to respond to this notice is July 10, 2009.  No site visits to the facility are allowed.  Requested information shall be limited to no more than 20 pages.  Interested firms are instructed to submit written responses by e-mail to jennifer.friel@ars.usda.gov, fax to 301-504-1220 or mail to Jennifer Friel, USDA, ARS, FD, Ames Modernization Branch, 5601 Sunnyside Avenue, Mailstop 5145, Beltsville, MD 20705-5145.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT
For Yuma Groundwater Management Upgrades, Well Drilling
This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes only.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.  The Yuma Area Office of the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) currently operates four high-capacity production well systems in the Yuma area.  The well fields have been established under various congressional acts to control groundwater levels and meet contractual obligations with various water districts for draining the Association Lands, provide return flows for delivery of water to Mexico to meet treaty obligations, and to provide return flow credits for the various water districts.  In order to meet current and future commitments, new and replacement wells will be needed on a regular basis.  Reclamation needs the flexibility to have new and replacement wells designed and drilled using current industry standards and meeting Arizona State requirements.
Currently, Reclamation operates and maintains 66 wells located in the following four well fields:
	(a) Yuma Valley	(b) Yuma Mesa	(c) South Gila Valley	(d) 242 Well Field
Existing wells vary from a minimum depth of 150 feet to a maximum depth of 600 feet.  Flow rates vary from 1,800 to 4,000 gallons per minute.  
It is Reclamation's intent to provide for a maximum of twenty (20) test holes or a maximum of twenty (20) piezometer wells, or a maximum of twenty (20) new or replacement 20 inch production wells or a combination of a number of test holes, piezometer wells, or 20 inch production wells as detailed in the task orders at specified sites per year during the term of the contract. It is intended that this will be a multiyear indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity type contract.  It is estimated that a maximum of 20 drainage wells, test holes, or piezometer wells will be required to be drilled and/or developed per year.  The Contractor will be required to furnish all labor, equipment, materials and incidentals necessary to drill a test hole/piezometer well if required, collect the necessary geological data for a well design, furnish a complete well design to Reclamation for review and approval, and/or drill and develop a 20-inch production well at the designated location or locations.
The proposed contract will be a firm fixed-price construction contract.  This acquisition, when announced will be conducted under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 237110, Water and Sewer Line and Related Structures Construction. 
The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region, is seeking responsible sources having capabilities to perform the work.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, and management capability of such offerors to perform this type of work.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.
Capability statements are to be submitted not later than July 20, 2009.  The capabilities package submitted should demonstrate the firm's experience and capability to perform the principal components of work listed above.  Packages should include the following information:  
(1) Provide business name, address, business size and type (8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran, Small Business, Large Business, etc.), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number.

The project list should specify the types of wells designed and/or drilled.  For each project listed, provide the following: dollar value of the job, the facility name, facility location, and the customer's contact name and phone number for the work completed.     The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of potential contractors.  This is not a request for proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this sources sought notice.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice.

Employee Demographics - Employees at this location are primarily professional with ahigher end compensation level. The employee base does very little travel and the male/female ratio is relatively even. Approximately 65 percent of JPLs employees work analternate workweek schedule with every other Friday off or Regular Day Off (RDO). Theseemployees typically work a nine-hour day.2. Cafeteria and Company Store Hours - Hours of operation are as follows: Breakfast (6:30a.m. to 10:30 a.m.); Lunch (11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.); Afternoon Break (2:00 p.m. to 3:30p.m.); JPL Store (8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.) On the RDO Friday, one (1) of the three (3)cafeterias is open with a limited menu (typically there are approximately 1,700 employeeson-lab on RDO Friday). 3.

This notice may represent the only official notice.To analyze the associations of historical data on intimal media thickness  and other cardiovascular health risk with cognitive and other psychosocial measures collected as part of the ongoing Early Markers of cognitive Change and Alzheimers disease and Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging studies also compare result to analogous baseline measures collected during the first examination wave of the Health Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the life Span study.  This procurement will provide crucial results to improve our understanding of the ways in which factors such as hypertension, arterial compliance, atherosclerosis, and other cardiovascular risk factors influence age associated change in cognitive performance and other psychological measure. A.	Description of supplies and services required to meet program need:  Statistical software for analyses and data organization.B.	This contract will provide the government with expertise crucial for examining the association of cardiovascular risk factors and their relationships with age-associated cognitive changes.C.	Date of Project Initiation: Immediately upon award.  D.	Perform sophisticated multivariate anlyses and write publication-quality reports on the relationships of cardiovascular health risks with cognitive and psychosocial measures from ongoing studies in our laboratory, the Early Markers of Cognitive Change and Alzheimers Disease, Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study.  These analyses will apply hierarchical growth  modeling procedures to these data in an effort to detect differences in rates of change in psychological measures associated with risk factors for cardiovascular conditions.
The fundamental scientific paradigm guiding research in the Laboratory of Personality and Cognition is the analyses of individual defferences.  Few phenomena are more basic than the fact that human beings differ in health , in rates of aging, in cognitive ability, in personality, in happiness, and in life satisfaction.
The Cognition Section studies the psychological mechanisms that distinguish pathological from healthy, age-related cognitive changes in a broad range of cognitive tasks including short-term and long-term memory, visuo-spatial rotation, attention and decision tasks, and problem solving.  Studies focus on structural and functional brain changes using neuroimaging and their relationship to changes in cognitive performance and the development of dementia.  Studies also examine the psychological and psycho-physiological mechanisms underlying age-related changes in memory, learning and reasoning, problem solving, information processing, and the roles of psychological and physiological characteristics in age differences and age changes in cognitive performances.Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.

<DESC><p>This is a Research and Development (R &amp; D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement. Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.
<p>Background.</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) Intramural Research Program (IRP) in Baltimore conducts human subject research in compliance with state and federal regulatory guidelines. In 1999 a significant addition to the mission was added to encompass interventional clinical trials and additional observational studies, in addition to the existing Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), the longest continuous study of normative aging in the world. The expansion also included the implementation of a parallel, integrated, community-based approach to the study of normative aging identified as the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) program which is conducted in Baltimore neighborhoods onboard three Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs) within the Baltimore area. Accrual of this program's participant population began in October 2000. Successful methodologies have been developed that promote participation in clinical research among individuals from groups that have been traditionally under-represented in such research and who bear a disproportionate burden of age-associated disease and disability.</p>
<p>These projects have been undertaken as a unified clinical trials program within the Clinical Research Branch (CRB) in the NIA IRP to maximize efficiency in terms of staff cost and cross training, provide a common support infrastructure including but not limited to clinical laboratory support and medical records, and to provide uniformly applied common testing approaches required by the science for the spectrum of normative aging research trials under development. In order to continue the expanded research agenda to include longitudinal, observational and interventional studies, the NIA obtained sufficient space to house the combined clinical research programs with provisions for performance of inpatient care, an outpatient clinic and support functions in a Clinical Research Unit. This space, occupying 24,000 SF, is located on the 5th floor of Harbor Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. <br /><br />The research program includes the scientific disciplines of biochemistry, cellular and molecular biology, genetics, physiology, immunology, neuroscience, neurogenetics, behavioral sciences (psychology, cognition, psychophysiology), epidemiology, statistics, and clinical research and the medical disciplines of neurobiology, immunology, endocrinology, cardiology, rheumatology, hematology, oncology, and gerontology. Medical problems associated with aging are pursued in depth using the tools of modern laboratory and clinical research. <br /><br />Clinical investigative initiatives include seven primary areas in addition to the current BLSA and HANDLS longitudinal normative aging studies. The areas of clinical research study and/or interventional trials include: Endocrinology (diabetes mellitus, therapeutic effects of hormone replacement and growth hormone, hormones and receptors), Rheumatology (Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid arthritis, body composition, biomarkers and metabolic pathways in inflammatory states)Cardiology (atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness, coronary artery restenosis, neovascularization), Clinical Pharmacology (pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, mechanisms of drug action), Neurology (dementias, neuromuscular diseases, Parkinson's disease and early markers of Alzheimer's Disease), Immunology/Infectious Disease (vaccine strategies, pneumococcal infection, T-cell function enhancement, chemokine biology and immunosensesence) Genetics (gene therapy, genomic characterization studies) and Hematology-Oncology (anemia assessment and lymphoma and solid tumor treatment with early phase trials using new agents such as anti-angiogenesis agents, novel immune enhancement and pharmacologic approaches with available agents and for symptom control). Some participants will receive standard or conventional treatment in conjunction with research-related interventions as appropriate for the underlying disease process under study.<br /><br />The current number of research studies is 81 with 26 of these involving Clinical trials. The types of Research Protocols include 1) screening, 2) training, 3) natural history (disease progression, sample data collection, recruiting; and sample data collection, not recruiting), 4) Pharmacokinetic dynamics and 5) Clinical Trials (Phase 0, I.II, III, and IV).<br /><br />Facilities within this program include seven research laboratories, a Clinical Core Laboratory, three Medical Research Vehicles, a 3T MRI unit, the NIA Clinical Research Unit which is comprised of 10-bed inpatient unit, outpatient testing facilities as well as a licensed Pharmacy, a 4-bed Cytapheresis Unit , a Protocol Office, and a Medical Records Department.<br /><br />Support and coordination of the NIA Clinical Research Unit is under the CRB. The NIA Clinical Director, who serves as the Branch Chief, plans, manages and supports the conduct of intramural clinical research focused on the cause, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of age-associated diseases and fosters the translation of advances in basic science into clinical applications. The Clinical Director also holds the responsibility for ensuring the quality and safety of clinical trials within the Institute. To that end, the NIA Protocol Office, under the NIA Clinical Director, is charged with establishing standards and providing regulatory support for the Program. <br /><br />The Branch: (1) provides the infrastructure needed to promote high quality clinical research and ensure patient safety, including; protocol review, clinic infrastructure, nursing and physician support, clinical informatics, data and safety management; (2) monitors and maintains quality assurance of the intramural clinical research program; (3) develops and implements clinical program priorities, allocates clinical resources; (4) integrates the established research themes and projects with clinical relevance from various IRP laboratories and branches; (5) evaluates program effectiveness and represents the IRP in management and scientific decision-making meetings within the Institute; (6) coordinates the credentialing of health care providers within the Institute; (7) coordinates and provides clinical research training for NIA staff and fellows; and (8) develops novel approaches for carrying out translational research in an efficient and cost-effective manner.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives.</p>
<p>The mission of the CRB is to provide a model for age-associated research programs by providing infrastructure for, and performance of cutting edge clinical research within a coordinated multi-disciplinary environment. <br /><br />The expanded clinical research program will continue to develop translational clinical research emphasizing aging and age-associated diseases. Translational studies represent the practical application of basic laboratory discoveries to the clinical setting, and as such, require an efficient synergism between those conducting basic research and those framing and conducting the clinical investigation. Successful translation of basic research requires coordination of the efforts by laboratory investigators, statisticians, physician-scientists, clinicians, and other patient-care providers. Strong linkages between the bench and the Clinical Research Unit enhance the likelihood of success for this bench to bedside approach. <br /><br />The BLSA is ongoing. The objective is to continue to collect viable and useful longitudinal data on aging participants so that it may be used to expand the understanding of normative aging. The central focus of the research is to understand age-related changes in physiology and the ability to adapt to environmental stress. This understanding is then applied to developing insight about the pathophysiology of age-related diseases. The program seeks to understand the changes associated with healthy aging and to define the criteria for evaluating when a change becomes pathologic. Thus, not only are the common age-related diseases under study (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, diabetes, cancer), but the determinants of healthy aging are also being defined. <br /><br />HANDLS is designed to evaluate normative age-related health disparities in minority and socio-economically diverse populations by going out into communities and collecting research data onboard three MRVs. The focal point of the HANDLS research program is on investigations specific to understanding the possible biomedical and behavioral basis of health disparities and designing effective preventive and therapeutic interventions for this population. <br /><br />Project requirements.</p>
<p>The Contractor will have the benefit and responsibility of working in concert with Federal managers, principal investigators and employees who have developed and currently work on these protocols. It is estimated that approximately 700 research participants will be seen per year at the stationary facility and approximately 1200 will be seen at the mobile research facility. The Contractor will provide all required support to execute these protocols, to include, but not limited to, recruitment and retention of participants, medical records processing and storage, IT management, testing (physical, psychological and physiological), biological sample storage and archiving, emergency medical care if needed, transportation, MRV support, scheduling, participant compensation, participant education, quality assurance, safety, protocol management, Institutional Review Boards as required, a licensed research pharmacy, laboratory support and staff support for approximately 120 FTEs to include unit orientation, training, travel, and etc. The Contractor may be required to subcontract for specific services as needed.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to assess its own procedures on a continuous basis and develop improved patient handling and testing procedures designed to (a) improve the viability of data collected (b) improve cost efficiency of operations and (c) increase volume of participants that can be safely processed.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance is one 12-month base year from 4/1/10 through 3/31/11 with four 12-month option years thereafter.</p>

<DESC><p>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division - Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the University of Denver, for the purchase of a High Field, High Frequency, Magnetoelectronic Measurement System.
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) requirement for a High Field, High Frequency, Magnetoelectronic Measurement System for DC and microwave electrical measurements of nanoscale magnetic devices. The University of Denver (DU) designed and assembled a system specifically for performing high frequency electrical measurements of magnetic devices that meets the NIST technical requirements. Two other similar systems have been constructed at NIST over the years, and the system designed by DU contains significant improvements to the existing NIST systems. Specifically, the DU system includes additional high field capability and field uniformity not present in existing NIST systems, and also includes custom microwave probes designed to measure magnetic devices in the high field gap of an electromagnet, while themselves remaining outside the gap. As these are critical parameters in the measurements, the requested system represents a substantial improvement to the present NIST capabilities. No commercial vendor has the knowledge base necessary to construct such a system in its entirety. As a result, the University of Denver is the only source for the required system. Delivery date shall be 14 days after receipt of order.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - Sources Sought to repair and refurbish a historical elevator located at Vanderbilt Mansion.
This is a sources sought for planning purposes only!
The National Park Service is seeking sources technically capable of repairing a historic elevator at the Vanderbilt Mansion. The elevator was installed by the Otis Elevator Company as a hand operated lift in 1897.  Shortly thereafter, the Otis Elevator Company returned and installed locking safety devices on all the doors.  The Otis Elevator Company again returned in 1936 to electrify and install control systems.  No work, other than normal inspections, testing and maintenance has been performed since that date.  The project is intended to replace the operating machinery, safety and control systems with modern equipment while preserving the historic car, doors, lighting and control devices that are visible to the public.  As it is paramount that the historic fabric be preserved and the results of all new work be invisible to the visiting public, the firm and the workers on the job, have a proven record of experience in retrofitting and preserving this vintage and type of elevator, (i.e. Pre World War II small single car Otis systems.), as well as the ability to obtain modern parts that will interface seamlessly with the remaining original fabric and mechanical devices. (For example, retrofitting the existing hoistway and car call buttons, light and alarm switches to work with modern web and other contact systems used with newer controllers.) 
Firms interested should provide documentation sufficient to demonstrate capability to perform the above work and a brief history of work performed similar in size, nature and technical expertise. Responses are request not later than close of business 1 July 2009.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT:   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to purchase a Self-Contained Mobile Radiation Monitoring System that can perform radioactive surveys and provide real-time moving map displays, with data logging, of GPS navigational position and radiation levels for large areas from Radiation Solutions, Inc. (RSI); 160 Matheson Blvd E., Unit 4; Mississaugh, Ontario Canada L4Z1V4.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY for purpose of (1) negotiating a sole source procurement with Radiation Solutions, Inc. and (2) conducting Market Research to support
a Buy American Act Waiver and is not a Request for Proposal.  EPA intends to specify the mobile radiation monitoring system as "non-available" under FAR 52.225-1, Buy American Act - Supplies and in accordance with FAR 25.103(b)(2)(i) for the Buy American Act Waiver.  This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred by interested parties for responses to this Sources Sought Notice.  No solicitation is available. 
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for a ground-based system that is consistent with other RSI systems used at EPA and which provides advanced digital gamma-ray spectrometer for mapping ground-based gamma contamination.  It is a self-contained mobile radiation monitoring system that is capable of collecting, displaying, and storing spectra from a minimum of four (4) 4?x 4?x 16? NaI detectors with both individual and gain matched summed output(s) with GPS and date/time stamp.  This system has high sensitivity, and directionally finds and localizes both man made and natural radioactive x ray and gamma ray emitting materials.   The system is capable of measuring, recording, 
and displaying the following:  complete spectral data w/ GPS coordinates, vehicle track, a minimum of 10 user programmable, spectral regions of interest, and radiation exposure levels in uR/hr (Cs 137 equivalent 30 3000 keV).   The system performs spectrum peak searches and nuclide identification for assessment of radiation contamination.  The system is rugged, modular in design, easily transported and has the flexibility to be deployed in a vehicle or other mobile portable platform.  All system components that will be exposed to the environment are weatherproof.  The vendor is supplying everything needed for a "turn-key" system. 
 Purchase of  the RSI Self-Contained Mobile Radiation Monitoring System that can perform radioactive surveys and provide real-time moving map displays, with data logging, of GPS navigational position and radiation levels for large areas is crucial to the mission of the EPA Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, Radiological Emergency Response Team for the following reasons:  (1)  EPA currently uses three RSI systems for decontamination requirements; (2) Purchase of this RSI system provides for the following which are not available from other manufacturers and for which there is no known competition which resembles this application:  (a) an integrated detection system which uses identical 
software and data export formats identical to existing systems within the EPA Special Teams, (b) a proprietary process that utilizes a fully linearized 1,024 channel resolution without changing the Poisson distribution performance, (c) automatic gain stabilization using natural isotopes, (d) a system that operates within expected temperatures range (-20?F to 110?F), and, (e) Proprietary Advance Digital Spectrometer module that converts analog signal from a detector to a digital spectrum with a 1,000,000 channel resolution;   
(3) Purchase of this additional system will allow for compatibility with and provide continuity between the existing RSI systems and the new system to be purchased; (4) Procurement of this system from the same manufacturer will provide EPA with greater efficiency of operator training and provide for successful interchangeability of operators across the agency's other Special Teams who currently use RSI systems;  (5)  Data generated by the system that EPA is currently purchasing will be incorporated easily and successfully with data from the other existing systems to provide spatial representation of contaminated areas by 
standardizing on equipment from one manufacturer; and, (6) EPA software development can be utilized in a consistent standardized methodology for all RSI systems for data exporting to other formats. RSI's detection technology incorporates a fully digital system design, spectral analysis and advanced data processing which provides a level of radiation detection previously only attainable in laboratory equipment.  The data collected by this technology will provide On Scene Coordinators, Health Physicist, Toxicologists, and Federal Health experts with ready access to radiological specific information to 
facilitate decision making during radiological or nuclear terrorism, nuclear power plant disasters, non terrorism radiological environmental emergency responses, and other removal or remedial actions.   In addition, this technology directly supports the EPA Office of Homeland Security.  EPA believes that Radiation Solutions, Inc. is the only vendor capable of satisfying the Agency's requirement.  The circumstances permitting Other Than full and Open Competition justification is FAR 6.302, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements." 
The full Statement of Work (SOW), including technical requirements can be viewed on the EPA website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 334519 - Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 people. 
The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any other source(s) exist and, therefore, no RFP is currently available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide a capability statement but instead choose to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFP will not be honored.

The NRC is responsible for ensuring adequate safety and security for radioactive materials, including transactions involving radioactive materials, and the materials licensing process.  This project directly supports these goals by providing a secure and effective set of automated tools to house and maintain information on licensees, nationally tracked sources possessed by licensees, and licensee transactions.  The NRC seeks contractor support for the planning, acquisition, system certification, development, deployment, hosting, and maintenance of NRC’s Integrated Source Management Portfolio (ISMP) project.  The portfolio consists of three systems, two that are in the planning stages   the License Verification System (LVS) and the Web Based Licensing (WBL) System; and one system already in operation   the National Source Tracking System (NSTS). The contractor would be expected to perform development, testing, training, and deployment of the LVS and WBL systems; and Maintenance and Operational (M&O) support, user support, and hosting of LVS, WBL, and NSTS.

BACKGROUND

Within the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Office of Federal and State Materials and Environmental Management Programs (FSME) develops, implements and oversees the regulatory framework for industrial, commercial, and medical uses of radioactive materials, uranium recovery activities, and the decommissioning of previously operating nuclear facilities and power plants.  In addition, FSME conducts extensive environmental assessments in Support of these regulatory functions. Our regulatory work is done in a manner that protects public health and safety, provides for the common defense and security, and protects the environment.  We implement these regulatory programs in coordination with our partners at other Federal agencies, the States, the NRC Regions, and Tribal governments.

The events of September 11, 2001 heightened the nation’s concern regarding the use of radioactive materials for a malevolent act.  The potential for such an attack has been of particular concern because of the widespread use of radioactive materials (often contained in sealed sources) in the United States and abroad by industry, hospitals, and academic institutions.  A major impetus for this project is the need to control nuclear materials that could be used in a radiological dispersal device (RDD) or “dirty bomb” – a conventional explosive that carries nuclear materials and releases them on detonation.  The NRC has been proactively working on material “real time” tracking capability since 2005. 

In late 2006 and early 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a test on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s controls governing the issuance of licenses for possessing certain types of radioactive materials and for enforcing possession limits on the quantities of those materials.  Subsequently, GAO reported that they were able to obtain radioactive materials licenses for two fabricated companies, modify the licenses to raise the possession limits, and utilize the augmented licenses to receive quotes for purchasing radioactive materials from legitimate licensees.

At a July 12, 2007 Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) hearing following GAO’s report, it was suggested that the NRC should consider establishing a web-based licensing (verification) system that would allow suppliers to validate purchaser licenses and the authorized quantity that a purchaser could obtain.  Former NRC Commissioner, Edward McGaffigan Jr., stated that information technology (IT) is one area in which NRC should improve to prevent fraudulent radioactive material license claims and alteration of possession limits.  GAO, NRC, and Congress deemed this as a necessary and urgent IT initiative to protect the nation from the threat of malevolent use of nuclear materials.

In an effort to better track radioactive materials, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission developed a comprehensive Action Plan outlining a number of specific steps to address the concerns raised by the GAO report and in the Senate Committee hearing.  This plan consists of a portfolio of automated tools for credential tracking (license and certificate), inspection tracking, item tracking (devices and sources), event tracking, license verification, and financial interfacing.  Initial development efforts that are included in the portfolio were – (1) the National Source Tracking System (NSTS), (2) the Web-Based Licensing (WBL), system and (3) the License Verification System (LVS).  NSTS is currently in the final stages of development.  A description of each system is provided below.

National Source Tracking System (NSTS)

The National Source Tracking System (NSTS), which has been under development since 2003, is a tracking system for the transfer of responsibility of sealed sources of radioactive materials. This tracking spans the life cycle of the source from manufacture through shipment receipt, decay, and burial. It supports controlled authorizations and accountability for licensed suppliers and licensed recipients of sealed sources.  The successful implementation of NSTS will satisfy NRC’s commitment to Congress to develop source tracking regulations as envisioned in the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Code of Conduct in 2004.   NSTS was given authority to operate (ATO) in December 2008.  NSTS is a Level 4 system has a “High” security categorization.

Web-Based Licensing System (WBL)

The Web-Based Licensing System (WBL) is envisioned as a NRC material licensing system for managing licensing information for businesses using radioactive materials. The NRC web-based licensing system includes the licensing life cycle from initial application, license issuance, amendment, reporting, and de-licensing. Designed to maintain information on NRC material licensees, it is planned to support an interface for inclusion of licensing information from 36 Agreement States which support and manage their own material licenses.  In addition, this requirement entails developing a web-based interface for materials Licensees; and replacing while improving upon the functionality currently embodied in several of the NRC=s legacy systems; namely, the License Tracking System (LTS), the Inspection Planning System (IPS), Reciprocity Tracking System (RTS), and Transportation Approval Package Information System, (TAPIS).  WBL is a Level 3 system and has a “Moderate” security categorization.

License Verification System (LVS)

The License Verification System (LVS) is envisioned as a “national verification system” that would access NRC and Agreement State licensee information and be used for purposes of detecting and preventing unauthorized parties with malicious intent from obtaining nuclear materials. The LVS is planned to be an integrated service that shall broker information stored in WBL and NSTS to provide the validations to ensure that (a) a license is valid and accurate; (b) a licensee is authorized for acquiring quantities and types of radioactive materials; and (c) the current levels of licensee inventory tracked sources is within the possession limits.  The LVS will be designed to handle request transactions for validation functions. It shall work in much the same way as the approval process for a credit card purchase.  When a merchant checks to verify a credit card the only information returned is whether or not the transaction is approved.  LVS will take in the validation request and, through examination of information available from both NSTS and WBL, will provide a response indicating whether or not a license is valid and a pending purchase is within the bounds of the possession limits and inventory.  LVS is a Level 3 system that has a “Moderate” security categorization.

The contractor shall comply with all Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) guidance for Level 4 authentication.  The facility shall provide general hosting and operational support for a system requiring High confidentiality, High integrity, and High Availability.  All hardware and software shall comply with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140 2.  The hosting infrastructure shall include at least two geographically disparate sites to provide remediation from emergencies.  The system shall employ a multi-tiered web architecture with levels of redundancy to ensure automatic failover.

<DESC>Request For Information for 
Tower Cranes Upgrade Project

General Information
Document Type: 	Sources Sought Notice
Solicitation Number:	TBD

Contracting Office Address

USCG Engineering Logistics Center
Yard Acquisition Branch (044)
M/S 26, Bldg 31 
2401 Hawkins Point Rd
Baltimore, MD 21226

Background

The Baltimore USCG Yard has a need to convert or upgrade four of its five portal cranes. All cranes are revolver cranes with main hoist, auxiliary hoist, boom hoist, travel and rotating motions. While the cranes have been well maintained, the controls are approaching the end of their useful service life. As spare parts become increasingly hard to source and as the motors, generators and controls continue to age, causing the systems on these cranes to become increasingly expensive and time consuming to maintain.

The following is a brief description of the Tower Cranes:

Crane # 1 was built by Clyde Iron Works in 1972 and is a motor-generator (M-G) controlled machine with individual motor generator combinations for each motion. The electrical control system controls the field current of the generators, which in turn control the armature output to the motors.

Cranes # 3 & # 5, incorporate control systems from 1964 by Westinghouse, which utilizes variable reactance and variable resistance to control motor speed. The systems use 440 VAC which is a little uncommon as compared to typical three phase industrial power which uses 460/480 VAC.  By the nature of the controls, they are sensitive to the incoming line voltage. Therefore, a shore power system must match the design voltage of the control system.

Crane # 4 contains a modern electro-hydraulic control system from 1996 by Cornell Crane Manufacturing Ltd. This system uses AC drive for gantry motion and hydraulic motors for all other motions. The hydraulic motors are driven by one 200 hp hydraulic pump with a 40 hp charge pump and a 5 hp circulating pump. The existing generator set was recently upgraded to a Caterpillar C15 400 kW generator set which is located on the lower works. The C15 was chosen based on time constraints and it was the first available unit at the time of order.


Scope of Work

The objective of this Request for Information/Sources Sought Notice (RFI) is to determine the ways to meet the requirements for Shipyard Tower Crane electrical conversion and installation work, and under what terms such a contractual vehicle might be established.  The USCG’s intended nature of this contract is described below.  

The Contractor shall furnish the detail design, all labor, materials, equipment, tools, fabrications, consumables, and installations, necessary for the retrofit project described in the following specifications. The complete system shall be a ‘turnkey’ installation.  All shop fabrication and installation drawings are to be provided by and are the responsibility of the Contractor. The contractor shall convert the crane power supply from a self contained diesel generator set to shore power supplied electrical system via a cable reel system.  The modernization includes, but is not limited to the following:

1.  Detail design and installation of a cable reel electrical power system to take electrical power from the pier and make all necessary mechanical and electrical changes to power the crane via this cable reel system.  The design shall include provision for a remote emergency power connection at the base of the crane to allow for a portable generator set to power the crane in the event of a power outage.  Two of the four cranes being converted will require the addition of conductor rings to the crane cab to carry the electrical power, as the present configuration has the diesel generator set located in the cab area above the crane pivot.  The remaining cranes are configured with the diesel generator set below to the pivot point and already have conductor rings in place.

2.  In addition to the cable reel conversion described above, crane number one requires a replacement DC control system for operating the crane.  The present system is obsolete and unsupportable.  The contractor shall perform a detail design for a new DC control system based on the requirements below.  The contractor shall purchase all materials and install the new control system, test in all modes, document the system, and provide technical manuals for the operation, troubleshooting and repair of the control system. The new control system will interface with the cable reel conversion described above. 

General Overview of Work to be Accomplished for the Crane One Control System:

This specification is written around the use of DC drives supplied by shore power.  DC controls would reuse the existing DC motors. The five DC generators now powering the DC motors would not be reused in a DC drive based system and will be could be removed.  DC encoders will need to be installed for the hoist motions.

The Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, tools, fabrications, consumables, and installations, necessary for the retrofit project described in the following specifications. The complete system shall be a ‘turnkey’ installation.  All shop fabrication and installation drawings are to be provided by and are the responsibility of the Contractor.

The modernization includes, but is not limited to the following:

a.  Remove and replace existing control equipment that will not be reused including: diesel engine and gearbox, main, auxiliary and boom hoist controls, bridge and trolley controls, generators, non-reusable conduit, and wiring.  Existing wiring that terminates in the new control system panel(s) shall not be reused.

b.  Purchase and install a turnkey DC drive based system with step-down / isolation transformer(s) as required.

c.  Purchase and install a new operator’s chair with new master switches, indicator lights and selector switches.

d.  Purchase and install a new 480:208V dry-type transformer and over-current protection to supply the existing lighting panel and loads now supplied by the 208VAC alternator.

e.  The contractor shall reuse the existing limit switches.

f.  The contractor shall reuse all mechanical brakes with the DC Drive upgrade. The Contractor shall be responsible for providing and installing new brake control circuitry.  Any existing braking resistors shall be replaced.

 
The answers to the questions stated under Response Instruction are requested to be addressed in the response to the RFI.  The estimated cost of producing the all services and materials is also an essential part of any response to the RFI.

This RFI is the first step that USCG plans to take to solicit input and interest from the vendor community and to promote competition in response to the forthcoming solicitation. 

Response Instructions

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Lonza Walkesville, Inc., 8830 Biggs Ford Road, Walkersville, MD 21793-8415 for Amaxa Nucleofector 96-Well Shuttle, which includes Laptop. Research developed within the Special Pathogens branch has advanced our understanding of molecular virology with the use of reverse genetics and RNA interference. Both technologies demand efficient delivery of nucleic acid into cultured cells with minimal impact on cell viability. In the case of reverse genetics the goal is to launch infection of a genetically recombinant virus to experimentally determine components of the virus genome in virus assembly, replication, and assembly. RNA interference technologies allow the researcher to investigate what and how cellular pathways are involved with virus infection. The Amaxa Nucleofector transfects nucleic acid in a 96-well format using optimized conditions to ensure the highest degree of nucleic acid delivery and cell viability, which is necessary for work within the Special Pathogens branch. Lonza, inc. is the sole company which develops and commercializes the Nucleofector Technology, which is a non-viral transfection method designed for primary cells and difficult-to-transfect cell lines. It is an integrated, turn-key methodology based upon three components: the Nucleofector Device (or System) that delivers defined electrical pulses to cells in suspension; cell-specific kits containing specially-formulated transfection solutions that condition cells to facilitate transfection with the optimal pulse; and optimized protocols and experimental conditions detaining the handling of cells, pre, post, and during nucleofection. Nucleofection has been used successfully to transfect over 400 different cell lines and 100 primary cells at levels of efficiency, viability, and functionality unachievable by traditional chemical and electroporation methods. It is particularly effective transfecting non-dividing cells because, unlike other methods, no cell division is required for stable integration. This non-viral methodology delivers substrate to the cytoplasm and the nucleus making it suitable for stable clone generation in addition to transient transfection. Nucleofection has delivered DNA, RNA, siRNA, shRNA, Morpholinos, peptides, proteins, antibodies and small molecules making it a versatile tool that can be used throughout project enabling maximum amount of information to be gained from any particular cell type. The technology can easily co-transfect substrates, and unlike other transfection methods, Nucleofection allows the detection of expression in as few as 3 hours. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.</p>

The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed contract is for conducting photo-identification surveys of Gray Whales from Southeast Alaska and Canada in conjunction with other surveys. Part of this study involves photographing the natural markings on the backs of gray whales to identify individual animals. Photographs collected during the season will be compared with others taken in previous years and at other locations to document return visits in successive years and movements of whales between Northern Washington and other regions along the coast. <br />Work and services to be performed<br />1) Match identification photographs of gray whales taken in 2009 by NMML, Cascadia Research Collective (CRC), and other researchers that are being contracted to provide photographs to CRC.<br />2) Provide a summary report on the 2009 photographic identification collections provided. The report should detail numbers of photographs and individual whales by region and month and movements of whales between regions within- and between years. It should also provide closed-population estimates of population size by comparing re-sightings from consecutive years 2008-2009.<br />3) Provide an electronic data file containing a record for each day a whale was sighted and photographed for identification in 2009. Each record should contain the CRC Id for the whale and the location (region and latitude and longitude if available) and date of the photograph.<br />4) Provide a single Abest@ left/right side digital image of each whale photographed in 2009 by NMML, CRC, and other researchers that were contracted by NMML and provided photographs to CRC. Each digital image file should be named with the CRC Id with a A09" suffix to represent the year.<br />5) Conduct opportunistic photo-identification surveys of gray whales from Southeast Alaska to Canada in conjunction with other surveys conducted by CRC.
<p>Cascadia Research Collective has been collecting photographs of gray whales since 1979 and they collect gray whale photographs from researchers working along US and Canadian coast. They have catalogs that cover gray whales along the entire west coast and the longest in terms of time frame and geographic coverage.

<DESC>ARRA - The existing contract requires remote gate automation updates on 3 of the 9 the Fox River dams. The remaining 6 were included in the original solicitation as options. However, these options were not awarded due to a lack of available funds. After award of the contract, funding became available through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to be utilized on the Fox River project. It was determined that the best use of the funds would be to exercise the options on the existing contract to perform the remote gate automation updates on the remaining dams. NOTE: THIS IS A MODIFICATION TO AN EXISTING CONTRACT - W911XK-08-C-0023.

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<BR><BR>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification using Recovery Act funding to contract number W91278-08-C-0013, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Allatoona Lake Project, Cartersville, Georgia, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815 Hennessey, OK. Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for, to add the following work:  1) The contractor will upgrade selected septic systems from vault type to field line systems. This work will be accomplished in Clark North and Clark South campgrounds; 2) Removal of existing bathroom facilities at McKinney campground, (AL-22, AL-22A, AL-22B, AL-22C, and AL-23), filling in or removing septic vaults and preparing sites for new pre-fabricated bathroom/shower house facilities; 3) The contractor will also install new energy efficient heaters in Victoria Day Use Area and Victoria Campground bathrooms; 4) The contractor shall install utilities for a new bathroom at Payne boat ramp. This will require excavating a trench for the water line, connecting to the existing water line, constructing a new septic system, and having the power company connect an electrical meter and service in this area; 5) The contractor shall furnish an oil water separator, complete with building for the purpose of complying with federal standards for water run off. This system is intended to be utilized for the washing of Government vehicles and equipment; 6) The contractor shall provide utilities and site work for six pre-fabricated gatehouses. This shall include septic system installation, having utilities in place, and having connections in an area acceptable to the building manufacturer. The areas included are Galts, Victoria Day Use, Blockhouse, McKaskey, Tanyard Boat Ramp, and Stamp Creek Campground. This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage, and water systems. Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into existing contract.     <BR> <BR>This existing contract must be used for the following reasons: 1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared. The extent of the work and the resources needed cannot be fully determined prior to starting the work, because conditions are different at each individual site. 2) The contractor is responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings and structures in the Allatoona recreation area. 3) The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance, and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation. 4) This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and during inspections without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public assess to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.<BR> <BR> The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet its requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<DESC>This Notice is provided for Information Purposes Only. Using Recovery Act funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-09-C-0020, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway, Columbus, Mississippi, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815, Hennessey, Oklahoma.  The contractor will assist in the inspection of all drainage structures in the Divide Cut Area of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway. This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions. Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the contract.<BR> <BR>This existing contract must be used because:   1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed cannot be fully determined and will require differing types of equipment and personnel with the changing site conditions. 2)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize adverse affects to the rest of the project.    <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and to the maximum extent practicable making fixed-price (FP) contract awards using competitive procedures.  However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts.  Although Mobile District's contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk.  In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles for the work anticipated under this modification.  <BR>

The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>Factor 5 - Enhanced 911 Service. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. <br />(i) All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 estimated amount of $500.00 is for evaluation purposes only and will be used to evaluate each offeror's proposal for taxes, fees, and surcharges. Upon award, the awardee must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Only those taxes, fees, and surcharges that are documented as applicable and allowable will be accepted; the resulting contract will be modified to add those actual fixed prices. Moreover, contract CLIN X004 must be modified for actual prices prior to the awardee invoicing for CLIN X004. The awardee may neither request nor invoice for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt and for any taxes not added by modification. <br /><br />(ii) The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1, including applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges added by a modification after contract award. The contractor may submit, on a yearly basis, a request for equitable adjustment for taxes, fees, and surcharges to include supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSAF3460899H50000001 . <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation issued for brand name commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Methods, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and justified in accordance with the procedures required by FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for brand name descriptions.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a firm fixed price quotation is requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is NAMA-09-Q-0080 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33, effective Jun 15, 2009.  This is a Full and Open, Brand Name Only solicitation under NAICS 561621 with a size standard of $12.5 million. The Government intends to issue an order based on initial quotations without discussions. Evaluation and order issuance will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.106, Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation.  Best value for this order will be evaluated based on a lowest price technically acceptable evaluation.  In order to be determined technically acceptable, all quotation submission requirements must be met including the required documentation outlined below.  BACKGROUND:  The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has the requirement to maintain and update the existing Enhanced Software Support for the Honeywell Prowatch Security System.  The Honeywell Prowatch Security System is a computer based system used to identify Government Employees and Government Contractors, to monitor access to NARA’s Archives II location, and to maintain a history file of all security activities.  This software is for operating Security Control System, Card Access Control and for monitoring high security areas at the National Archives II only.  This requirement is for proprietary software updates, product support and technical training that can only be obtained from the manufacturer or the manufacturer’s re-sellers.  REQUIREMENTS:  This is a Brand Name, firm-fixed price RFQ with a base period of performance of 12 months, beginning with the end date of the warranty period, with four 12 month option periods.  All delivery costs must be included in the total firm-fixed price quote.  NARA requires brand certified service because of the proprietary nature of specialized systems and the lack of compatibility among competing products.  Also, NARA requires that any and all vendors submitting quotes shall provide proof of authorization from Honeywell.  This is a request for quote and quotations furnished are not offers.  This request does not commit the Government to pay any cost incurred in the preparations of the submission of this quotation or to contract for supplies or services.  Any representations and/or certifications attached to this request for quotation must be completed by the Vendor.  FOB destination pricing is requested.  Vendors must ensure that the products meet the requirements of Section 508, as applicable.

<DESC>Synopsis:

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Maryland intends to award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA’s) to Small Business Sources capable of providing Title Search Services, Title Insurance Commitments and Final Policies, and Closing Services for the purchase of easements on properties enrolled in the Wetland Reserve Program (WRP), Grassland Reserve Program (GRP), and the Emergency Watershed Protection Program- Flood Plain Easement (EWPP-FPE).


A BPA is a method of filling anticipated repetitive needs. It is not a contract. The Government is not obligated to place any orders nor is the vendor obligated to accept any orders. For each work assignment, the Government will request title services through the issuance of a BPA call order from those firms that have been awarded BPA’s. Individual call orders shall be submitted in accordance with the terms agreed to in the BPA’s. Government personnel authorized to place call orders under the BPA will be identified on the BPA by name and telephone number. The contractor will be expected to furnish the service in accordance with the terms and conditions of the BPA, without the need for additional paperwork beyond the Statement of Work that accompanies the order. 



This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).



This is a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The applicable NAICS Code is 541191, with a business size standard of $6.5M.


PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Title and Closing services are being sought for a period of five years with a contract period of July 23, 2009 to September 30, 2014. The BPA will remain in effect until cancelled by either party.


See the attached files and Statement of Work for details.



The provisions of FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders—Commercial Items, applies to this solicitation and are attached.



The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-32.

You may register easily and quickly online at www.ccr.gov or 1-888-227-2423.

<DESC>This acquisition is for Standby Compass Calibrators and Master Compasses to support the CV-22 aircraft platform.  The Compass Calibrator is used to align/calibrate the Standby Compass without removing the Compass from the aircraft.  The Compass Calibrator cancels the earth's field at the Standby Compass and adds a standard magnetic field which can be rotated to simulate aircraft direction.  Therefore, Compass error can be determined without physically rotating the aircraft via conventional airborne or ground swinging processes, allowing for Compass alignment in a quicker and less expensive manner.  The Compass Calibrator consists of a base assembly, a knob assembly, and a magnet assembly.  It is mounted to the aircraft's Standby compass via the mounting bracket and is housed in a metal case for storage and transportation.  The Master Compass is required to test the Compass Calibrator for proper operation before the Calibrator is brought onboard the CV-22 and used to test the aircraft's Standby Compass.

<DESC>This research opportunity is soliciting alternatives to heat pipes for arresting the thermal impact
from the exhaust plumes of new and impending aircraft on amphibious ships. Both above deck
and below deck thermal management systems are being solicited. The objective is to develop
systems that offer both above and below-deck options, are cost-effective to install or maintain, and last the service life of the ship. Deck thermal management systems should be capable of mitigating a heating rate of 16,000 to 24,000 BTU/minute and a total heat load capacity of 48,000 BTU to 2.2 MBTU over a time period.

Critical thermal management technologies are to: spread, conduct, and/or dissipate heat with
minimal thickness and minimal weight impact; comply within deck-height/flight operations
constraints and horizontal configuration; carry structural load and meet survivability
4 requirements; integrate with ship structures; be installable in a shipyard environment; avoid
generation of debris/products causing foreign object damage debris; and be compatible with Navy non-skid coatings.

ONR anticipates making multiple contract and grant awards that total $12.5 million over a four
year period, with $3 million available in FY2011, $4 million available in FY2012, $3.5 million in
FY2013 and $2 million available in FY2014. The typical award amount will likely be in the
range of $200,000 to $1 million per year.

White papers for this BAA are due 06 AUG 2009 by 2:00PM Eastern Time, Full Proposals are due by 23 OCT 2009 at 2:00PM Eastern Time.

CLIN 0001-0006:   GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENT (I.E. LINE DECRIPTIONS & MANUFACTURER NAME/PART NUMBERS) IS PROVIDED IN THE ATTACHED “REQUEST FOR OFFER/QUOTES”.

THIS IS AN “UNRESTRICTED” “BRAND NAME” PROCUREMENT.  All equipment and associated parts must be as requested as they are part of a complete system/package.  Substitutions will only be considered upon notification an item has been discontinued or replaced for which an amendment to this solicitation will be posted with the new part number (s).  The Government will consider offers/quotes only from “authorized resellers” of the referenced manufacturers.  Contractors are encouraged but not required to quote on all items (aggregate quote must be over $3,000).  The government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government’s best interest to do so(FAR 52.214-22 - Evaluation of Bids for Multiple Awards). Contractor’s offers/quotes must be FOB Destination or will be considered non-responsive.  

The Government will issue an order to the responsible quoter, with acceptable past performance, submitting the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation.  This order will include the following referenced clauses which may be accessed electronically at www.arnet.gov:
	FAR 52.204-9 (Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (SEP 2007)
	FAR 52.212-4 (Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items) (MAR 2009)
	FAR 52.212-5 (Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders-Commercial Items) (APR 2009)
	FAR 52.219-8 (Utilization of Small Business Concerns and Small Disadvantage Business Concerns) (MAY 2004)
	FAR 52.232-33 (Payment by Electronic Funds-Central Contractor Registration) (OCT 2003)
	DFARS 252.204-7004, Alt A (Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (SEP 2007)
	DFARS 252.232-7003 (Electronic Submission of Payment Request) (MAR 2008)
	DFARS 252.246-7000 (Material Inspection and Receiving Report) (MAR 2008)

Additional FAR and DFARS clauses required by the regulations will be included.
Local DMC clauses, 52.0100-4028 (Contract Contact Information)(DMC) (JUN 2005) and 52.0100-4094 (Marking Instructions for All Items to Include Drop Ship and Direct Shipment) (JUN 2004), will be included. 


Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, has determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an “Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)” be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an “Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)” be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the “Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)” or the “Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)” option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the “Invoice” option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

<DESC><p align="left">This&nbsp;Request for Quotations (RFQ)&nbsp;is for two (2) coherent fiber optic (FO) bundles&nbsp;for use on the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) Beam Emission Spectroscopy (BES) Diagnostic operating at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), Princeton, New Jersey. The&nbsp;selected vendor&nbsp;shall supply 34 separate bundles in <strong>two assemblies</strong>. All bundles are to be <strong>40 meters long </strong>and formed into 2 assemblies of 17 bundles each. There are <strong>9 fibers in each</strong>. At the machine (viewing) end, the buffer is&nbsp;stripped back a considerable distance beyond the ferrule and the exposed length of cladding is protected by heat shrink tubing. The fibers of each bundle are terminated into a square ferrule at the machine (viewing) end, and a rectangular ferrule at the detector end.&nbsp;The selected vendor shall&nbsp;supply all materials,&nbsp;machine&nbsp;ferrules and form them into assemblies described in PPPL Specification No.&nbsp;D-NSTX-SPEC-12-102, Rev. 1, dated June 5, 2009.&nbsp;In its quotation, the offeror is requested to provide cost and delivery for the base number, and for a larger number of bundles. The base design is 2 assemblies of 17 bundles each, and a larger number, 2 assemblies of 21, 25, 28 or 33 bundles each.&nbsp;The offeror&nbsp;is requested to&nbsp;provide details of the design in the bid package and to offer an alternate design to that described by the PPPL attachments and specification, if quality, cost and or schedule are favorably impacted. The&nbsp;selected vendor&nbsp;is to furnish, at PPPL's expense, two 40 meter fiber samples to PPPL before&nbsp;fabrication is authorized. The samples are to be identical to the type of fiber that will be used for the bundle assemblies, polished at both ends, for PPPL to evaluate the numerical aperture (NA) and transmission characteristics. PPPL will have one week from time of receipt of the fiber samples to evaluate the fiber transmission and NA characteristics. If these fiber characteristics are found to be satisfactory, PPPL will authorize the vendor to proceed with bundle fabrication.&nbsp; The&nbsp;selected vendor&nbsp;is also&nbsp;to furnish, at PPPL's expense, 9 two meter long fiber samples. The samples are to be identical or equivalent to that specified and described in this specification, for PPPL to evaluate the bend radius characteristics of a sample bundle. That means the buffer should be stripped back 4 inches and heat shrink tubing applied. The potting and ferrule are not necessary if the heat shrink tubing extends to the end of the fibers and the 3x3 pattern is achieved. See RFQ No. 09-080-W for further details of this requirement.</p>

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103.  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) 3052.209.70 / 48 CFR 3009.104-75 Prohibition on contracts with corporate expatriates (Jun 2006).
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

Legal effect of quotations: As prescribed in FAR 13.004(a) A quotation is not an offer and, consequently cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Therefore issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier’s quotation does not establish a contract.  The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions.  A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.  Facsimile quotes are acceptable and may be forwarded via fax number 252-335-6452.  Point of contact is Daniel House, Phone 252-384-7230, and email: Daniel.K.House@uscg.mil.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation—Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
Request for Quotations (RFQ) will be evaluated against the requirements listed in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, and the ALC drawings.

Quotes may be submitted on company letterhead stationary and must include the following information: Solicitation Number, Nomenclature, Part Number, Unit Price, Extended Price, Payment Terms and discount offered for prompt payment. 

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government in technical factors, and price considered.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors are listed in order of importance.  When combined, non-price factors are more important than price. 

1)	Technical Conformance to Specifications
2)	Past Performance
3)	Warranty
4)	Price

Technical Conformance 

The technical evaluation will include examination of the product literature and technical features for conformance with the requirements of the drawings. Evaluation of products will be on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating obtaining any information not identified in the offer. An offer that does not provide sufficient information which describes their capacity to meet the RFQ’s technical evaluation criteria can result in failure of this evaluation factor. 

Past Performance

Offers shall provide at least two (2) references for recent and relevant contracts for the manufacturing of safety belts.  Reference information must include contract numbers, points of contract names with telephone numbers and other relevant information.  For this factor the Government will evaluate information obtained from past performance information that the Government obtains about the offeror from these contacts or other sources.  Failure to address this requirement can result in failure of this evaluation factor.

Warranty
 
Offerors are required to offer the Government at least the same warranty terms, including offers of extended warranties, offered to the general public in customary commercial practice.

Price

Proposals should identify any price reductions offered, or quantity discounts.

(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.

(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

<DESC>Restricted to eligible 8(a) program participants serviced by the SBA San Francisco, Fresno, Sacramento, Los Angeles, Santa Ana, and San Diego District Offices, and SBA Seattle and Portland District Offices, and other 8(a) construction firms with a bona-fide places of business located in the specified geographical area in which the work is to be performed. No solicitation will be available. The draft BOA and the BOA submittal requirements are posted on FED BIZ OPPS in conjunction with this announcement. The United States Coast Guard Civil Engineering Unit Oakland is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) firms serviced by SBA District Offices in Washington, Oregon, and California, and other 8(a) participants with bona-fide places of business in Washington, Oregon, and California to participate in a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) Pilot Program. BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U.S. Small Business Administration. The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the US Coast Guard, Civil Engineering Unit (CEU) Oakland, and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of construction services, if and when ordered. The BOA contains contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to all task orders issued under the BOA according to the dollar amount of each task order. Annually, CEU Oakland will review the continued need for the BOA in light of (a) usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program for new entrants twice a year. Under the BOA 8(a) firms compete on task orders for construction and construction related service requirements pursuant to the BOA. General contractors are preferred, but specialty contractors will be considered as well. Individual projects will be solicited and awarded if and when required. CEU Oakland gives no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Coast Guard to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Coast Guard solicit and acquire covered services from that contractor only. The anticipated construction work may require a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. The anticipated construction work to be covered under the BOAs include, but is not limited to, new construction, minor construction projects [exterior and interior renovations, alterations, repairs (emergency and routine)], handling of hazardous waste and material, maintenance, mechanical, electrical, heating/air conditioning, painting, paving, earthwork, demolition, installing pipelines, and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls only). Construction projects covered under the BOA are for work performed in the NAICS Sub-sector Codes 236, 237, and 238. 

GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers Coast Guard and government installations in Washington, Oregon, and California. 

PERFORMANCE PERIOD: The performance period for the BOA is three (3) years with the Government reserving the right to grant extensions for up to two (2) additional years with no single extension exceeding one year OR until the firm graduates from the 8(a) program, whichever occurs first. Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly. The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. Either party may cancel the agreement with 60 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on task orders issued prior to the effective date of cancellation. 

SOLICITATIONS: Each project solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror, and evaluation criteria and the basis for award to be used for each project. The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, may consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price. If the award basis will be on price alone, the Contractor may be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000. CEU Oakland will require Performance and Payment Bonds on each Task order over $25,000. The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time. 

ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded using the Optional Form 347 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract. 

LIMITATION OF ORDERS: The range will be from $2,000 to a maximum of $3,000,000. Firms must demonstrate they meet the qualifications to receive a BOA. Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either “Eligible” or “Ineligible.” To qualify for a BOA each firm must meet the following submittal requirements (DOWNLOAD AND USE CHECKLIST FROM THIS WEBSITE TO ENSURE ALL SUBMITTALS ARE PROVIDED): (1) Completed contractor information sheet.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
     Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>QUESTION 1: On the above Solicitation, it asks for Firewire 400 &amp; USB2.0 connectivity, but later on in the specs, it asks for 3.0GB/s speed which is available only through eSATA connectivity. Should these be bid as Quad-Interface drives to cover both eventualities?</p>
<p>ANSWER 1:&nbsp; Our requirements are for a minumum of triple connectivity:
<p>* Firewire 400<br />* USB 2.0<br />* eSATA</p>
<p>You may bid quad connectivity (which would presumably be adding Firewire 800 to the list of possibilities), but it is not required. Only the three specifications listed above are required.</p>

We are not looking for a comprehensive environmental assessment but rather a snapshot of the compliance status of the building(s) at the time of the visit.

While the number of compliance sites are not specifically addressed, compliance areas (e.g. asbestos, solid waste, UST) are listed in the Protocol.  The contractor will be responsible for acquiring the necessary information to address the questions found in the Protocol in Appendix B.  For example, the interview with the Property Manager will assist the contractor with determining the number of hazardous material storage areas within the building.  These are typical office buildings and not TSDF's.  Please keep that in mind.  The contractor will need to verify whether appropriate storage practices are implemented.  Previous audit reports will be provided upon award.

Pre bid conference call will be on Tuesday, June 30, 2009 at 10:30am Pacific Standard Time.  We have one hour.  The phone number for the bridgeline  is (702)388-6900.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this modification to the original FBO announcement and&nbsp;Award Notice&nbsp;is as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The purpose of this modification is to highlight the fact that there has been an administrative, no-cost change to the initial Task Order Number assigned to this acquisition. This notice will also serve as a record of explanation of why there is a different Task Order Number on all&nbsp;prior related Fed Biz Ops postings.</p>
<p>2. Due to an internal glitch in our contract writing software, subject file required that a new Task Order Number be assigned to it. All other terms and conditions remain unchanged. Old # was F29650-00-D-0002-5571, new # is F29650-00-D-0002-5611.</p>
<p>3. All parties involved have been notified of said change.</p>

<CONTACT>Cynthia Hische, 609-485-6288

<a href="mailto:cynthia.hische@faa.gov">cynthia.hische@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The FAA has a requirement to obtain support to the FAA in conducting safety risk research on safety of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS).
It is proposed to award a five year contract (one year with four option years) to FJLeonelli Group of Waxhaw, North Carolina.  FJLeonelli Group is the only known source who has the expertise and the background to perform this requirement.  
Purpose of Announcement: In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform the industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single source procedures.  
This announcement is for informational purposes only.  It is not a Solicitation or Request for Proposal.  A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.
Safe integration of unmanned aircraft system (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS) poses greater technical challenges not only to the FAA but also the aviation industry.  UAS utilizes the most advaced technologies to achieve certain operational capabilities far exceeding the expectations of current NAS users.  These unique capabilities have demonstrated its potential of commercial applications as well as exceeding the expectations of current NAS users.  Data from the recently completed UAS technology survey sponsored by the FAA shows that integrating UAS in the NAS will potentially affect the entire NAS due to the various sizes of UAS (less than a foot up to the size of a commercial jet), wide ranges of maximum take-off weight (less than a pound to the weight of a large jet), large performance disparities in reference to the existing certificated aircraft and capabilities of operating in all classes of airspace (even the ones weighing less than 100 pounds are operating in Class A airspace).
In 2004, under the FAA request, the RTCA established a special committee 203 (SC203)to develop minimum aviation system perfomance standards for UAS, UAS Sense and Avoid Systems and UAS Command, Control and Communication Systems (C3).  Since then, the RTCA SC203 has been leading the effort of developing industry consensus standards for UAS SAA and C3, which are key and probably the most technically challenging issues for UAS to operate in the NAS.  These RTCA SC203 efforts, with active industry participation, are supported by the FAA, DOD and other Government agencies.  However, although UAS SAA and C3 standards are necessary to meet certain mandatory requirements as defined in the FAA regulations (14 CFR) but other regulatory requirements providing the minimum standards for the NAS safety must be met as well.  To consider these NAS safety requirements for UAS demands a thorough understanding of the FAA regulatory framework, its construct, its subchapters and their interrelations/interdependencies as well as their safety implications and demonstrated compliance requirements.Therefore, to meet the FAA goal of safe integration of UAS in the NAS, i.e., "DO NO HARM" and "NO ADVERSE IMPACT TO EXISTING NAS USERS", a systematic approach with basis of the FAA regulatory framework is needed to conduct research in suport of the development of UAS airworthiness standards, devise operational requirements, establish maintenance procedures, and conduct safety oversight activities.  Such a systematic approach will also support the FAA efforts in Next Gen implementation by studying safety implications of new aircraft technology to the NAS and supporting the development of new regulatory standards while implementing these new technologies.The Flight Safety Team is responsible for the FAA Unmanned Aircraft System Research program under the FAA Research , Engineering and Development Appropriation.  Under the program, UAS safety risk management is a high priority requirement.  It applies the principle of Safety Management System (SMS) Doctrine, FAA Order VS8000.1 issued by the FAA Office of Aviation Safety (AVS) to develop regulatory bassed metholologies to assess UAS risks and their mitigations while operating in the NAS and interacting with other users. Although, the SMS is mandated by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) only in three areas:  Annex 6 - Operation of Aircraft, Annex 11 - Air Traffic Services and Annex 14 - Aerodrome, the AVSSMS and expanded the SMS principle to its regulations in aircraft and airmen by requiring each of its "services/offices to develop and implement a plan for its funcitons under the AVSSMS, including, where appropriate, the structure of its safety oversight relationship with the segment of industry for which it holds safety oversight responsibility".  The regulatory-based SMS research directly supports this AVS mandate.There are many entities conducting UAS safety risk analysis related research.  However, they all, including the RTCA SC203 led effort, limit their efforts on UAS operational issues and/or particular operational scenarios with specific UAS.  The systemic and regulatory based SMS approach has not been adopted and applied.

<p>NOAA's primary environmental mission is to provide weather forecasts and warnings for the United States, its territories, adjacent waters and ocean area, for the protection of life and property and the enhancement of the national economy. Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) allow for constant observations of the Earth's environment from geostationary orbit. These observations provide data for environmental phenomena affecting ecosystems, climate forecasts, weather and water, and supporting the safe and efficient operation of the Nation's transportation and commerce systems for the National economy.</p>
<p><br />The NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) procurement of the next-generation series of GOES (GOES-R) will replace the current GOES I and N-series satellites. The GOES R-series satellites are required to sustain capabilities through 2027. Due to lifetime probability predictions for the current GOES I and N-series, a GOES-R launch is required in the 2015 timeframe to maintain mission data continuity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />The Ground Antenna System is being procured in a contract separate from the GOES-R Satellite and Ground Segment contracts. The Ground Antenna System includes the design, fabrication, and test of six (6) new antenna stations and the upgrade of four (4) antenna stations. The antenna stations will be installed at three different sites: Wallops, Virginia (three new antenna stations); Suitland, Maryland (four antenna station upgrades); and a Remote Backup site in the vicinity of Fairmont, West Virginia (three new antenna stations). The new antenna stations will require operability with the GOES-R satellites and be backward- compatible with the current GOES I and N-series satellites.</p>
<p><br />The Government intends to acquire the Ground Segment Antenna System products and services through full and open competition conducted under FAR Part 15.&nbsp; The Government envisions the award of a single contract.</p>
<p><br />All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the Government. A site tour of the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility (NSOF) in Suitland is anticipated on or about June 22, 2009. A site tour of the Wallops Command and Data Acquisition Station (WCDAS) is anticipated on or about July 9, 2009. The anticipated release date of the Final RFP is on or about August&nbsp;2009.&nbsp; The anticipated award date is April 2010.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for closing agent services for single family properties owned by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in one geographic area, the state of Missouri.  HUD intends to award one contract to cover the state of Missouri.  The primary objective is to perform closings of HUD-owned properties as quickly as possible, within 50 miles of the subject property.   A purchaser is normally allowed 30-60 calendar days to close a transaction, however, sometimes HUD may offer special incentive programs to homebuyers to close in a shorter period of time, such as 15 days after contract signing.  The contractor is expected to coordinate with the Management and Marketing contractor (M&M) to accomplish the closing within the allotted timeframe unless an extension is necessary due to circumstances outside of the contractor’s control.   The contract will be performance-based with incentives and disincentives.  The contract duration will be for one year with four one-year options.  This is a total small business set-aside.  More detailed information concerning the work requirements is provided in the solicitation.  The solicitation is now available for downloading from the Federal Business Opportunity website.  The NAICS Code is 541191 with a size standard of $7 million.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be made available.  Telephone and email requests for the solicitation will not be accepted.  Small business concerns need to respond with a written proposal by the due state stated in the solicitation.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for closing agent services for single family properties owned by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in one geographic area, the state of Oklahoma.  HUD intends to award one contract to cover the state of Oklahoma.  The primary objective is to perform closings of HUD-owned properties as quickly as possible, within 50 miles of the subject property.   A purchaser is normally allowed 30-60 calendar days to close a transaction, however, sometimes HUD may offer special incentive programs to homebuyers to close in a shorter period of time, such as 15 days after contract signing.  The contractor is expected to coordinate with the Management and Marketing contractor (M&M) to accomplish the closing within the allotted timeframe unless an extension is necessary due to circumstances outside of the contractor’s control.   The contract will be performance-based with incentives and disincentives.  The contract duration will be for one year with four one-year options.  This is a total small business set-aside.  More detailed information concerning the work requirements will be provided in the solicitation.  The solicitation is now available for downloading from the Federal Business Opportunity website.  The NAICS Code is 541191 with a size standard of $7 million.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be made available.  Telephone and email requests for the solicitation will not be accepted.  Small business concerns need to respond with a written proposal by the due state stated in the solicitation.

Delivery Orders will be issued by the Contracting Officer to describe a specific set of tasks contained in the PWS which are to be performed in a given timeframe.  These tasks will vary in scope and duration depending upon the level of services required.  It is possible that not every task specified in sections 3, 4, and 5 of this PWS, will be required in a given contract period.  Each Delivery Order will specify elements of work that are defined in paragraph 3.  These elements are to be performed by the Contractor to satisfy that Delivery Order.

<DESC><p>See attached Award Document FA8125-09-M-0265 for item details and specifics.</p>
<p>This acquistion was not solicited on FBO due to urgency and sole source requirements.&nbsp; See clause at 52.209-1, Qualification Requirements:</p>
<p>52.209-1 QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (FEB 1995)<br />(a) Definition: "Qualification requirement," as used in this clause, means a Government requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed before award.</p>
<p>(b) One or more qualification requirements apply to the supplies or services covered by this contract. For those supplies or services requiring qualification, whether the covered product or service is an end item under this contract or simply a component of an end item, the product, manufacturer, or source must have demonstrated that it meets the standards prescribed for qualification before award of this contract. The product, manufacturer, or source must be qualified at the time of award whether or not the name of the product, manufacturer, or source is actually included on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list. Offerors should contact the agency activity designated below to obtain all requirements that they or their products or services, or their subcontractors or their products or services, must satisfy to become qualified and to arrange for an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification.</p>
<p><br />(Name) Thomas Grijalva<br />(Address) 76 PMXG/QI, Materials Engineering<br />Tinker AFB, OK 73145<br />(405) 736-7139</p>
<p><br />(c) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service covered by a qualification requirement has already met the standards specified, the relevant information noted below should be provided.<br />Offeror's Name<br />Manufacturer's Name<br />Source's Name<br />Item Name<br />Service Identification<br />Test Number (to the extent known)</p>
<p><br />(d) Even though a product or service subject to a qualification requirement is not in itself an end item under this contract, the product, manufacturer, or source must nevertheless be qualified at the time of award of this contract. This is necessary whether the Contractor or a subcontractor will ultimately provide the product or service in question. If, after award, the Contracting Officer discovers that an applicable qualification requirement was not in fact met at the time of award, the Contracting Officer may either terminate the contract for default or allow performance to continue if adequate consideration is offered and the action is determined to be otherwise in the Government's best interests.<br />(e) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product, or service has met the qualification requirement but is not yet on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, the offeror must submit evidence of qualification prior to award of this contract. Unless determined to be in the Government's interests, award of this contract shall not be delayed to permit an offeror to submit evidence of qualification.<br />(f) Any change in location or ownership of the plant where a previously qualified product or service was manufactured or performed requires reevaluation of the qualification. Similarly, any change in location or ownership of a previously qualified manufacturer or source requires reevaluation of the qualification. The reevaluation must be accomplished before the date of award.<br />(End of clause)</p>

This support includes such things as developing Statements of Work and Schedules, assisting in the preparation of bid packages, assist in developing Project Performance Baselines, preparing design documents, etc.

Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:  The nature of the support will be on an as-needed basis and therefore is impossible to reach a fixed price subtask.

<AWARDEE>Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU), 100 ORAU Way, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 US
<DESC>Recovery Action:   Numerous facilities located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have been identified as structures for decontamination and demolition due to the condition of the buildings and their continued degradation.  The Integrated Facilities Disposition Project Critical Decision document provides the available information pertaining to each facility’s physical condition and extent of contamination.  For many buildings, this information is insufficient to prepare a well-defined cleanup solicitation or waste profiles for the disposition of generated waste.  The technical support required by ORO EM includes activities associated with planning and implementing independent facility characterization and verification.  DUNS:  041152224.

Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:  A competitive award was not used since starting the work immediately was imperative and Contract DE-AC05-06OR23100 is a Cost Plus Award Fee contract in which the independent environmental assessment and verification work is within the scope of the original procurement.  In addition, the nature of the work requires some flexibility to accomplish and therefore it would not be feasible to award the effort as fixed price.

<DESC>Recovery Action:   Numerous facilities located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have been identified as structures for decontamination and demolition due to the condition of the buildings and their continued degradation.  The Integrated Facilities Disposition Project Critical Decision document provides the available information pertaining to each facility’s physical condition and extent of contamination.  For many buildings, this information is insufficient to prepare a well-defined cleanup solicitation or waste profiles for the disposition of generated waste.  The technical support required by ORO EM includes activities associated with planning and implementing independent facility characterization and verification.  DUNS:  041152224.

Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:  A competitive award was not used since starting the work immediately was imperative and Contract DE-AC05-06OR23100 is a Cost Plus Award Fee contract in which the independent environmental assessment and verification work is within the scope of the original procurement.  In addition, the nature of the work requires some flexibility to accomplish and therefore it would not be feasible to award the effort as fixed price.

<AWARDEE>VALTRONIC TECHNOLOGY, INC.;6168 COCHRAN RD;SOLON;OH;441393306
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, has a requirement to procure services to assemble subretinal neurostimulators  A fixed price requirements contract is anticipated and shall be awarded.  It is the Governments belief that only Valtronic Technologies, possesses the required capabilities.  It is the Governments intention to solicit and negotiate only with Valtronic Technologies.  Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to assemble subretinal neurostimulators  are invited to submit complete and current information showing their capabilities within 5 calendar days from the day this notice is published.  Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information to allow the VA to evaluate the proposal relative to the above requirements.  This is not a solicitation; this is a request for information only.Inquires /information received after the established deadline shall not be considered.  The submission of this data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.  JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.  Identification of (1) the agency and (2) the contracting activity:	(1) VA Medical Center, Boston, MA	(2) Acquisition and Material Management Service	    940 Belmont Street	    Brockton, MA  023012. Nature and/or description of the action being approved:The Boston VA Center for Innovative Visual Rehabilitation wishes to purchase retinal implant electronic assembly services from Valtronic Technologies.3. Description of the supplies/services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):The purpose of the retinal implant assembly services is to aid the CIVR in developing chronically implantable subretinal neurostimulators.  This involves custom SMT assembly (including gold stud bump flip chip die attach operations) and highly specialized gold-tin soldering operations for critical prosthesis components at size scales below 500 microns.  The estimated value for the assembly of 160 such neurostimulators is $50,000.4. Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:FAR Part 6.302-1, Only one responsible source. (See #5 for clarification.)*5. Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:The proposed contractor has a highly skilled cadre of engineers that have been trained to develop specialized microelectronic assembly techniques which are specifically geared toward the creation of miniaturized neurostimulators for visual prosthesis research.  Valtronic has the most experience of any commercial vendor in existence with building miniaturized neural stimulators and they provide circuit assembly for a major vendor in the field, Advanced Bionics.  The development of  retinal prosthesis that is the core mission of the CIVR is contingent upon microassembly of the components in a timely manner with great accuracy.  *6. Describe the efforts that have been made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a Commerce Business Daily notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:The following vendors were contacted on May 8, 2008, and they were either unable to provide services meeting the standard of performance or they were unable to do so at any comparable price point:1.	I2A Technologies, Inc., Fremont, CA, 2.	HEI, Inc., Victoria, MN, 3.	Engent, Inc., Norcross, GA 7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  This determination will be made at time of award.8. Description of the market survey that was conducted (i.e. names of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:See the survey results under #6 above.  The CIVR (through the VA) has purchased micro-assembly services from the proposed contractor in the past at very favorable price points compared to similar vendors.9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as - an explanation as to why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statement of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for competition have not been developed or are not available.The VA CIVR has carefully developed high technology assembly capabilities through the proposed contractor.  These capabilities are not available elsewhere without substantial process development cost in time and dollars.   10. A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed an interest in theacquisition:  To date, no additional sources have expressed an interest.11. A statement of the actions, if any, that the department/service may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies/services is required in the future:If other vendors enter the field, or if existing vendors develop the necessary capabilities to meet the CIVRs needs at a competitive cost, consideration will be given these vendors in the future.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs VA Caribbean Healthcare System San Juan, has awarded contract No. VA248-P-1126 for Asbestos Air Monitoring Services at the new south bed tower corridor connections.  Below please find required Justification and Authorization(J&A) for the use of other than full and open competition.

MEMORANDUM
Date:  June 9, 2009										
From:	Contracting Officer (672/PBD)
Subj:	JUSTIFICATION AND AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL	AND OPEN COMPETITION; THIRD PARTY ASBESTOS AIR MONITORING & ASBESTOS             PROJECT SUPERVISION AT NEW PATIENT BED BUILDING CORRIDOR            CONNECTIONS. 
To:	File in reference to solicitation No. VA-248-09-RP-0471
1. AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: Department of Veterans Affairs, Procurement Business Division, Tres Rios Building, San Patricio, 27 Ave. J. Gonzalez Giusti, Suite 600, Guaynabo, PR, 00968. 	
2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: This is a sole source contract action to procure the services of a Certified Industrial Hygienist/ Company by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) to perform air monitoring, inspection and testing services during the asbestos abatement work at the corridor connections constructions of the New Patient Bed Building Project.
3.  DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: Third Party services to perform throughout abatement work monitoring, inspection and testing inside and around the regulated area in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements and VA Specification Section No. 01569 Part 2.3. 
4.  AUTHORITY CITED: FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency. 41 U.S.C. 253(c )(2).	5.  REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED: The Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits proposals. This procurement action is to comply with VA Specs. Section 01569 in which the VA is required to provide an Independent Industrial Hygienist (VPIH) to inspect and oversee; on behalf of the VA, the performance of the Contractor Industrial Hygiene (CPIH) to ensure that VA Patients employees and visitors will not be adversely affected by the abatement work and that such work proceeds in accordance with OSHA and VA Specifications.
Failure to award this contract in a timely manner will affect the construction progress schedule critical path for the South Bed Tower. This action is the only cost effective procedure to obtain this critical service in a timely manner, comply with regulations and avoid further delays. South Bed Tower contractor is already mobilized under contract and ready to start the asbestos abatement work.
6.  EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: This is a one time action. VA Specifications required (VIPH) to be registered in the Asbestos Analysis Registry or participate in the Analytic Testing Program oh AIHA for fiber counting quality control assurance. Thus, a search was conducted in the AIHA registry to seek registered companies.  Two local companies were found.  However, one of the companies is the South Bed Tower subcontractor company who will be performing the asbestos abatement (Analytical Environmental Services International).  Consequently, the only source available that meet this requirement is Environmental Health & Safety Services. Thus, services can be performed in a short period of time rather than waiting for an overseas vendor that can result in higher prices due to the cost of air fair or sub-contract. 7.  FAIR AND REASONABLE PRICE DETERMINATION: Estimated cost is $13,000.00     Estimated cost is based on historical data and current costs.  A request for Proposal will be issued to the Contractor.  Contractor's proposal will be evaluated against the estimated cost.  Negotiations will be held, if required, in order to reach a fair and reasonable price for both parties. 
8.  MARKET RESERCH: A market survey was not conducted for this action. See paragraph 6 above. 9.  OTHER FACTORS: None
10.  INTERESTED SOURCES: No other sources can provide the services in accordance with the Government needs and regulations in the required time frame. Refer to paragraph 8.
11.  ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION: Market driven. Refer to paragraph 6. 
12. TECHNICAL CERTIFICATION: "I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief."
