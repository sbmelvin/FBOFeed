<DESC>8.0	Organizational Conflict of Interest FAR 9.505-1 -- Providing Systems Engineering and Technical Direction. (a) A contractor that provides systems engineering and technical direction for a system but does not have overall contractual responsibility for its development, its integration, assembly, and checkout, or its production shall not -- (1) Be awarded a contract to supply the system or any of its major components; or (2) Be a subcontractor or consultant to a supplier of the system or any of its major components. (b) Systems engineering includes a combination of substantially all of the following activities: determining specifications, identifying and resolving interface problems, developing test requirements, evaluating test data, and supervising design. Technical  direction includes a combination of substantially all of the following activities: developing work statements, determining parameters, directing other contractors operations, and resolving technical controversies. In performing these activities, a contra ctor occupies a highly influential and responsible position in determining a systems basic concepts and supervising their execution by other contractors. Therefore this contractor should not be in a position to make decisions favoring its own products or capabilities.
