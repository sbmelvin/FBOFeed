<DESC>The Army Contracting Center - New Jersey, Information Technology Center, proposed action is to provide a base and option year extension on a sole source basis as a modification to Contract Number W91QUZ-06-D-0013, Task Order (TO) BA02, issued against the Army's Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software, and Solutions (CHESS) Information Technology Enterprise Solutions 2-Services (ITES-2S) Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle. The extension effort will continue to be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) order for System Development and Integration to avoid a service disruption prior to award of a competitive follow on contract. The proposed source is Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services (HPES), LLC, 13600 EDS Drive, Herndon, VA 20171-3225. HPES is currently responsible for providing system development and integration of current personnel-related systems whose functions and capabilities are resident in the Army Human Resource Systems (AHRS). Included in this requirement is the enabling of the migration of the eMILPO system to the Integrated Pay and Personnel System - Army (IPPS-A). Other systems that will continue to be supported by AHRS beyond the eMILPO migration are DTAS, which resides on the Secret Internet Protocol Network (SIPRNet), and TPS. Unavoidable new contractor phase-in time would affect customer service for real time soldiers worldwide, utilizing eMILPO, which is the Army's primary personnel database of record, and systemic hinge-pin between numerous Army and DoD systems. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and a Justification for Exception to Fair Opportunity has been approved for the extension. However, all interested parties may respond within fifteen (15) days after publication of this synopsis for the consideration by the Government. A determination not to compete the development and integration extension, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written inquiries may be directed to Contract Specialist Jake Perrotta via email at jake.r.perrotta.civ@mail.mil.

<CONTACT>Antoinette R Hazelwood, Contract Specialist, Phone 4107861579, Email antoinette.hazelwood@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>DME MAC Jurisdiction D Pre-solicitation Notice:
<p>As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS must re-compete its Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractors (DME MAC) contracts every five (5) years. The purpose of this contract is to obtain a DME MAC (hereinafter, referred to as "the Contractor") to provide specified health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare FFS program. The Contractor shall perform its responsibilities under the direction of CMS.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform numerous functions on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries and shall establish relationships with suppliers of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS), for a defined geographic area or "jurisdiction." The Contractor shall perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals and CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare FFS program. The Medicare FFS program's legal, policy and operating environment is complex, and the Contractor shall utilize or interact with certain CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment and/or operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor shall coordinate its activities not only with CMS, but also with a broad range of agencies (at the federal, state and local levels of government), other CMS partners and Contractors, and a diverse range of stakeholders within the health care system of the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with CMS' technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from DMEPOS suppliers and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction, as well as perform edits on these claims to determine whether the claims are complete and should be paid. An edit is defined as "logic within the Standard Claims Processing System (or PSC/ZPIC Supplemental Edit Software) that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review."</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor calculates Medicare payment amounts and remits these payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor also conducts a variety of different supplier services, such as answering written inquiries, and educating them on Medicare's rules and regulations and billing procedures. The Contractor also operates Medicare's supplier's toll-free lines across the country to answer a wide-range of supplier questions. Additionally, the Contractor conducts redeterminations on appeals of claims and responds to complex beneficiary inquiries referred from the Beneficiary Contact Centers.</p>
<p>CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for Jurisdiction D (comprised of the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, American Samoa, Guam, and Northern Mariana Islands) on or about November 20, 2014. The contract will include a base year plus four one-year options. The anticipated proposal due date is January 14, 2015 with an anticipated award date of September 14, 2015.</p>
<p>This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought Synopsis is issued for maximizing competition. The government is seeking responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis from all interested businesses capable of providing the requirement.  Should anything in the requirement be construed as limiting competition, please feel free to contact the MICC Special Competition Advocate (SCA) at dean.m.carsello.civ@mail.mil. <br>  <br> The Mission and Installation Contracting Command - Fort Knox is conducting market research to gauge interest in solicitation and award of a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC), which is a multiple award indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract, to provide meals, lodging, and transportation services for HQ USMEPCOM at various Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) located throughout the continental U.S., Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico.  This synopsis is not a request for proposal.  It is a market research tool used to determine procurement strategy and level of interest.  Appropriate strategy will be determined after consideration of industry response to this synopsis.  The government will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis. <br>  <br> The government intends to issue a single solicitation which will result in award of multiple ID/IQ contracts.  The exact number of contracts has not been determined.  The solicitation will be issued as a negotiated procurement.  Offerors will be required to submit both technical and price proposals.  Proposals will be evaluated using best value trade-off source selection procedures.  The government intends to award without discussions.  Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal must contain its best offer from a technical and price stand point.   <br>  <br> The appropriate NAICS code is 721110 with a size standard of $32,500,000.00.  <br>  <br> The period of performance of the resultant contracts will be five years, or until the contract ceiling is reached.   The government reserves the right to acquire services through other means if determined to be in the government's best interest. <br>  <br> Each MATOC will include a minimum guarantee equal to the successful offeror's proposed price for attendance at a mandatory post-award meeting to be held at Fort Knox, Ky.  The guaranteed minimum will be obligated through issuance of a task order at the time of award. <br>  <br> As existing contracts for these services expire, a Request for Task Order Proposal (RTOP) may be initiated.  The RTOP will be sent to the MATOC holders only.  Each MATOC holder will be limited to a certain number of proposals, the number of which is yet to be determined.  Firm-fixed price task orders (TO) will be issued for each location following evaluation of proposals.  MATOC holders may decline to submit a proposal for any location. <br>  <br> The successful MATOC holders shall be capable of providing meals, lodging, and transportation services every Sunday through Thursday, and on as many as 30 Fridays per year.  Services include, but are not limited to, the following: <br>  <br> 1.   Overnight lodging.  Contractors must demonstrate that proposed facilities will provide a secure environment and a positive experience for applicants.  Proposed facilities shall be located close enough to the local MEPS such that applicants can arrive on time each morning for processing.  Applicants shall be housed in facilities with interior room entry only and on floors 2 through 8 only.  Applicants will typically be lodged two per room with males and females being lodged separately.   A minimal number of single billeted rooms will be required for officer candidates.    Applicants will be afforded use of all hotel amenities available to other guests.   <br>  <br> 2.  Meals.  Applicants will be served a hot, plated supper meal the evening they arrive and a hot breakfast meal  the following morning prior to departure for the MEPS.  Dining facilities shall be located such that applicants do not have to exit the lodging facility to access the dining facility.  Arrangements shall be available for applicants arriving late to be fed upon arrival.   In addition, a contingency plan should be in place to provide up to 50 emergency lunches per year for applicants stranded due to transportation issues or other reasons.   A current passing government-issued food service inspection will be required for all proposed facilities.  <br>  <br> 3.  Transportation.   Applicants arriving at local airports and train stations must picked up and transported to the lodging facility.   Applicants must be transported en-masse from the lodging facility to the MEPS for processing each morning.  Transportation shall be via DoD approved bus services or by hotel shuttles.   The requirement for afternoon/evening transportation varies by location and will be described in the individual RTOPs for each MEPS.  <br>  <br> 4.  Security/Safety.  USMEPCOM is highly focused on the security and safety of applicants.   Applicants are generally teenagers or very young adults.  They require a significant amount of supervision to ensure that they are kept safe, fed, and arrive on-time at the MEPS, ready for processing.  This is beyond what can be expected of hotel management.  Therefore, at each location, MATOC holders shall provide a liaison(s) dedicated solely to attending to applicants.  Liaison(s) must be on duty any time applicants are present in the proposed lodging facility. <br>  <br> 5.  Reporting and Invoice tracking.  Contractor shall have the capability to track invoices at each location and submit detailed monthly invoices for payment.   <br>  <br> Responses to this announcement must be received no later than 2:00 p.m. eastern standard time on 21 November 2014.  Responses should be emailed to teresa.w.walker.civ@mail.mil.  Responses shall include the following: <br>  <br> 1.

<DESC>NASA is seeking your response to the Airship RFI provided as a link at the bottom or the top of this page.  A response form is also included to assist you in your submission. <P> NASA is considering a stratospheric airship challenge to incentivize the demonstration of a long duration scientific platform for both Earth and space sciences. In 2013, a Keck Institute study (Airships: A New Horizon for Science) demonstrated significant interest in airships as a science platform from the academic community and possible industrial partners. The final study report can be found at <A HREF="http://kiss.caltech.edu/study/airship/final-report.pdf">http://kiss.caltech.edu/stu dy/airship/final-report.pdf </A>      . <P> There are few opportunities for space missions in astronomy and Earth science. Airships (powered, maneuverable, lighter-than-air vehicles that can navigate a designated course) could offer significant gains in observational persistence over local and regional areas, sky and ground coverage, data downlink capability, payload flexibility, and over existing suborbital options at competitive prices. We seek to spur a demonstration of the capability for sustained airship flights as astronomy and Earth Science platforms in a way that is complementary with broad industry interests. <P> This 20-20-20 Airship Challenge is currently contemplated as a two-tiered challenge that could provide opportunities to evaluate a wide range of innovative methods to launch an airship into the stratosphere, maintain altitude, and station-keep for a defined period of time. This challenge would seek to engage the aerospace industry, educational institutions, and amateurs to provide solutions. The Challenge is considering a total prize purse ranging from $1 to $1.5 million dollars, which would be split into multiple prize awards for successful demonstrations of a stratospheric airship that could accomplish the following tasks: <p> 	Reach a minimum altitude of 20 km. 	Maintain the altitude for 20 hours (200 hours for Tier 2 competition). 	Remain within a 5 km diameter station area (and navigate between two designated points for Tier 2). 	Successfully return the 20 kg payload (200 kg for Tier 2 competition) and payload data. 	Show Airship scalability for longer duration flights with larger payloads through a scalability review. <P> The competition could take place over the next 3 to 4 years. Comments must be submitted in electronic form no later than 5:00pm Eastern Time on December 1, 2014 to Mr. Sam Ortega at e-mail address: <a href="mailto:HQ-STMD-CentennialChallenges@mail.nasa.gov">HQ-STMD-CentennialChallenges@mai l.nasa.gov </a> . Please use 202020 Challenge on the Subject line.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this RFI is to search for qualified vendors capable of meeting the Department of State (DoS) Near Eastern Affairs (NEA) and South Central Asian (SCA) regional requirement for a variety of language related services. The anticipated period of performance will be a base year plus four option years for a potential total of five years. This is set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned firms under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541930.</p>
<p>The DoS's high level objective for the contract foreign language support services requirement is to get the right skill set, to the right location, at the right time, and at a fair and reasonable cost. To accomplish this objective, it is envisioned that the contracts shall provide language-related services including interpreting, translating, and transcription services to support the missions in Iraq and the region. To ensure that high levels of quality, performance, and cost controls are maintained, it is envisioned that contractor(s) shall provide the necessary management, supervisory, and administrative personnel to direct, administer, and report on these services on a daily basis. Performance, deliverables, and exact location(s) of the work will be conveyed to the Contractor(s) by the Contracting Officer or his/her designated Contracting Officer Representative(s) (COR). The initial contract for Linguist services will be used for supporting Iraq requirements for Arabic, Kurdish, Dari and Pashto to include various dialects within these stated languages. The contract(s) shall require personnel who can perform monitoring, transcribing, translating, and interpreting (listening, writing, speaking, and reading) from the targeted language to English and vice versa, and occasionally, from one targeted language to another targeted language. Language proficiency testing is required in the source language(s) and English for all levels of linguists in the four basic communications skills: listening, reading, writing, and speaking. Evidence of language proficiency testing with acceptable results is required prior to assignment. All companies are required to have a Top Secret facility clearance. Additionally, a number of contractor personnel will require either a Top Secret or a Secret clearance. Linguist will be deployed to targeted area(s) with adequate contractor management staff and will be required to undergo the necessary screening, vetting, clearing, and approval processes prior to, during, and following deployment to the host nation.</p>

Dependent upon the results of this market survey, DoS may subsequently issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to acquire the support services.</p>
<p>General questions <br />1. If you were the Government, how would you structure this acquisition? <br />2. What quality assurance standards/methods do you think best for management and surveillance of linguist services during and after the transition period? <br />3. What do you see as the optimal strategy for meeting a regional linguist service requirement? <br />4. Do you have experience providing services of a similar size, scope and complexity in the Near Eastern Affairs/South Central Asian Region.</p>
<p><br />Company Information</p>
<p>1. Point of contact (to include phone and e-mail) <br />2. Website address, if applicable <br />3. Facility Clearance level and Cage Code <br />4.

<ARCHDATE>11112014
<CONTACT>Valerie A Robinson, Contracting Officer, Phone 240-613-8318, Email valerie.robinson@irs.gov
<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to issue a sole source firm-fixed price purchase order for the below list of software maintenance renewals of Athene/Unix &amp; Windows software tools to NETfusion, Inc.
<p>Purchase of software maintenance renewal for the Athene/Unix &amp; Windows software tools. Purchase includes the following line items: (1) Control Center (FY14) Software Maintenance, 12 months of maintenance, 4 each, (2) Sentinal (FY14) Software Maintenance, 12 months of maintenance, 1 each, (3) Explorer (FY14) Software Maintenance, 12 months of maintenance, 6 each, (4) Analyst (FY14) Software Maintenance, 12 months of maintenance, 6 each, (5) Planner (FY14) Software Maintenance, 12 months of maintenance, 6 each, (6) Auto Reporter (FY14) Software Maintenance, 12 months of maintenance, 2 each, (7) Trend (FY14) Software Maintenance, 12 months of maintenance, 1 each, (8) Acquires Enterprise License, (FY14) Software Maintenance, 12 months of maintenance, unlimited license, and (9) Technical Services (FY14) Software Maintenance, 12 months of maintenance, 10 each.<br />.</p>
<p>The period of performance is: 12months with two 1-year option periods.</p>
<p>This purchase order will be made on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 (a) - only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The anticipated value of the order is $537,782 to include reinstatement.</p>
<p>Justification for Other Than Full and Other Competition: "The Athene/Unix &amp; Windows will be used to perform an entire spectrum of data collection, data warehousing, performance alerting, performance analysis, modeling, capacity planning and detailed long term statistical analysis. The continued maintenance and support services for the current Athene/Unix &amp; Windows software tools are necessary to in order to carry out the necessary capacity analysis support required without interruption or system down time. The use of Athene/Unix &amp; Windows software tools is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.</p>
<p>The IRS Tier II Capacity Management Section has identified NETfusion, Inc of Brookeville, MD as the sole source for the Athene/Unix software system (including Athene, Control Center, Sentinel, Explorer, Analyst, Planner, Auto Report, Trend, Custom DB and Acquire)- along with all its components and services. The software and the modules are proprietary to NETfusion. NETfusion does not have any authorized resellers and therefore, is the only responsible source."</p>
<p>The notice of intent to award to NETfusion will be posted on FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR 5.2.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will determine the costs to the Government to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted and it was determined that only NetFusion can provide the required software maintenance as NetFusion does not have any authorized resellers and the software is proprietary.</p>
<p>No sources have expressed an interest, in writing, in the acquisition.</p>
<p>The IRS will continue to search the marketplace for authorized resellers of the Athene software products. However, as long as NetFusion is the only source for the Athene Enterprise Software products, the IRS will need to sole source the requirement to NetFusion. However in the meantime, as new products come on the market place, the IRS will evaluate those products and consider a future competitive acquisition.</p>
<p>The Contracting officer certifies that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>Responsible sources who believe they can provide the required products may submit a written capability statement, via email, by 11am ET on Friday, November 07, 2014. Telephone inquiries will be considered non-responsive. No solicitation will be issued, therefore, requests for solicitations will be considered non-responsive. If no responses are received the award will be made to NETfusion, Inc.</p>

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories has technologies that use non-invasive chemical analysis to potentially detect biological (bacterial and viral) compounds through the use of a small format, point of use instrument utilizing non-invasive chemical analysis. Sandia is conducting ongoing research and development in chemical biomarkers associated with human and animal diseases of interest. This research will establish the feasibility of using non-invasive, portable, rapid screen technology for the detection of infections, such as Ebola and MERS.<br />Sandia's capabilities include revolutionary technologies for the development of portable chemical sensing technologies and chemometrics analysis. Timely development of these technologies may enable their application as a high-volume screen to detect emerging threats to public health. Such a technology could also allow for the development of revolutionary new human and animal diagnostic tests for disease.
<p>Sandia currently has a unique opportunity with National Institutes of Health (NIH) to test these technologies in controlled biological settings that could expedite bringing these technologies to market. CRADA or WFO funding from partners would further enable the development of these capabilities with NIH, and place our partners in an excellent position to commercialize the resulting technologies.</p>
<p>Sandia seeks to partner with a company or companies interested in opportunities in (a) port of entry diagnosis of human medical conditions and (b) field, clinical or point of use settings. Partnerships may take the form of Cooperative Research &amp; Development Agreements (CRADA), or Work for Others (WFO) agreements.</p>
<p>Interested companies are preferred but not required to have experience and expertise in one or more of the following areas:</p>
<p>&bull;Development of biomarkers;<br />&bull;FDA medical device approval processes;<br />&bull;Device development; and<br />&bull;Biological/chemical sensors</p>
<p>Potential partners must have a significant interest in developing this technology since the CRADA or WFO is expected to include funds-in to Sandia from the partner. CRADAs and WFOs provide the potential for significant competitive advantages for our partners, including up to exclusive licenses to Sandia technologies.</p>

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), U.S. Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC) has a project that requires sequencing genomes of cattle. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 (current as of FAC 2001-24), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The NAICS is 541380. The Solicitation number AG6538S140202 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The description of items and clauses incorporated in this synopsis/solicitation are applicable to this procurement and will be incorporated into any resultant purchase order.
<p>The goal of this project is to determine interactions between genotypes of host cattle and E. coli O157:H7 bacteria in their digestive tract. Some host genotypes may be more favorable to colonization by this bacteria, ultimately resulting in &lsquo;super-shedders'-animals that are colonized for long periods of time at high numbers and are likely to cause increase overall infection rates. Genome analysis is expected identify marker genotypes that are more likely susceptible to high levels of E. coli O157:H7 colonization. To facilitate this goal, these animals must be genotyped for a broad marker set spanning the entire genome.</p>
<p>These markers can be used in selection programs to reduce the number of &lsquo;super-shedder' animals in the feedlot or to sort animals with high potential to become &lsquo;super-shedders' into different management groups with different vaccination strategies. The work supports the Center's missions of increasing the production efficiency of safe, high-quality food products.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements:</p>
<p>The provider must genotype DNA from these animals for the identical marker set that currently exists on the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip&reg; and the Illumina BovineHD(SNP770K) BeadChip&reg;. These markers are currently a standard for the industry and have been used in other populations at USMARC. The results can be more easily transferred to other populations because of the concordance between this population and other industry populations. A total of 340 (228 with the BovineSNP50 BeadChip&reg; and 112 with the BovineHD(SNP770K) BeadChip&reg;) animals are to be genotyped for these markers. All resulting genotypes must be returned to USMARC. All data needs to be available for USMARC download by October 15, 2014.</p>
<p>Contract Line Item Number (CLINs): CLIN 001 - Illumina Bovine SNP50 BeadChip analysis - 227 each; CLIN 002 - Illumina BovineHD (SNP770K) BeadChip analysis - 132 each.SAM: Vendor must be registered in the System for Award Management prior to the award of the contract.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p><br />(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

This research has established an essential technology base in related programs supportive of armor and armaments developments.  Many of the technologies that are emerging from ARL's current research programs are critical to the realization of the  quote mark leapahead quote mark  capabilities needed for the Army of the 21st Century. <br>  <br> The WMRD Protection Division (PD) conducts research and development in all aspects of high-explosive charges and their associated warheads.  The PD's research area includes explosive warhead and penetrator experimentation.  The Multi-Threat Armor Branch (MTAB) of the PD is extensively involved in the exploitation and characterization of shaped charge warheads.  To fulfill the mission in this area, the MTAB requires warhead explosive loading to support ongoing experimentation. ARL will provide the components, as Government Furnished Property (GFP), for the explosive loading and warhead assembly performance, which will include copper shaped charge liners, aluminum casings, Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) wave shapers, and delrin end caps.  <br>  <br> C.2 Requirements <br> C.2.1 The Contractor shall perform the explosive loading and warhead assembly performed according to specific drawings provided by the Government.  The drawings are NOT for public release and will be faxed or electronically mailed to eligible offerors upon request.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- <br> (1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ___ ) are, ( ___ ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency, <br> (2) ( ___ ) Have, ( ___ ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax <br> laws, or receiving stolen property; and <br> (3) ( ___ ) Are, ( ___ ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br> (4) ( ___ ) Have, ( ___ ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br> (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br> (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br> (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br> (ii) Examples. <br> (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br> (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should <br> the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br> (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br> (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br> (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Partial bids are not permitted in the FedBid Marketplace. Partial bid means a bid submitted through the website by a seller, which does not qualify as an acceptable bid under a Reverse Auction because it does not include all required line items or other specifications. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp. If internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC Level Protest Procedures. <BR> <BR>Sellers must present their representations and certifications, upon request, through the System for Award Management website at www.sam.gov. <BR> <BR>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Firm Fixed-Priced quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NAMA-15-Q-0013 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-74 effective November 1, 2014.

A contract will be issued to the Contractor(s) whose conforming quotation in response to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government. Best value for this procurement will be obtained through a lowest price technically acceptable evaluation. For evaluation purposes, the firm-fixed price for each CLIN will be determined by multiplying the Unit Price by the Quantity of units, and the total fixed price will be determined by summing the firm-fixed price of all CLINs. Contractors must provide pricing for each CLIN, including any Option CLINs.

Statement of Work
Specialized Cancer Testing
1.	Requirements 

TVHS needs a vendor to perform the following special cancer tests: Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, the Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay and the Oncotype DX Prostate Cancer Assay.  The required testing will analyze the activity of a group of genes that can affect how a cancer is likely to behave and respond to treatment.  Testing results need to show how complex genes are expressed in cells (what their level of activity is), and the role they play in specific cancers including breast, colon, and prostate.   
2.	Scope.
Base Plus Four Year Options. Indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) of cancer testing, with the required tests listed in the chart under "Specific Tasks." The minimal to satisfy this contract will be $1 and a maximum will be $60,000.00 annually.

TVHS will only accept tests of equivalent or higher performance to the Oncotype DX test.  Equivalent tests must show clinical evidence and at least three years on the market in labs (outside of research purposes).  The VA TVHS requires testing that has been reliable for years and will not risk experimenting with newer specialized cancer tests unless evidence guarantees greater benefits to Veterans.  

The requested tests have been proven to predict the likelihood of cancer recurrence, the likelihood of patient survival and the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit.  These unique diagnostic tests can help patients and their doctors make informed, individualized treatment decisions. Results will also help clinicians determine if the patient needs to undergo chemotherapy treatment or not, saving the VA thousands of dollars in treatment costs.

3.	Specific Tasks (Evaluation Factors).
The Reference Laboratory shall provide in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations, laws, and ordinances, and in accordance with the specifications outlined for accreditation certification if applicable, patient testing to aid in the treatment of cancer. Estimated quantities of tests will depend upon patient specifics.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-15-Q-200019 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-74 effective 1 November 2014, which also incorporates the provisions and clauses of FAC 2005-77.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Codes are 336413 and 336411.  The small business size standard ranges from 1,000 to 1,500 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a competitive basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)s, Bureau Normalisation Aeronautiqueespace (Cage Code: F0111), Alenia Aermacchi SPA (Cage Code: A0019), Leach International Europe SA (Cage Code: F0219), Goodrich Actuation Systems (Cage Code: F1688), and Thales Avionics Electrical (Cage Code: F0296).  Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

 SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET HSCG38-15-Q-200019-REQUIREMENTS FOR A LIST OF REQUIRED PARTS.

Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation.  Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew.  The Government shall ensure all procurements are awarded without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  

Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, or a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM.  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  

Alternate Parts will be authorized if they are an approved alternate under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) catalog system, which improves interoperability between NATO and commercial cataloging systems.  Alternate parts must satisfy all form, fit, and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) H-65 aircraft. 

The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance (COC) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. Certificate of Conformance must be submitted in the format specified in the clause.  All parts shall be NEW approved parts.

Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.  

Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government.  For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.

<p>Ombudsman Notice</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>Amendment 0001 to RFQ FA5613-15-T-0001 with a new due date for a submission of quotes, 16:00 Central European Time, 13 November 2014. 

Below is an answer received from a company:

1. " The tender describes a specific unit, which is a competitor unit. The
Douglas unit is completely different made, since 30 years in the market and
worldwide in use, worldwide brand leader with more than 1500 units sold,
including several US Air Force bases. The Douglas MuMeter is also used by
companies doing runway rubber removals for proving the work quality (Smets
Technology).

Our question:
Is it possible to quote a different product, which will do exactly the same
job - measuring friction values - and which will give additional
advantages?"

Our Answer to  Question 1 above:

This model " does not meet the requirement because water is not integrated".

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Regional Specialist position was developed in response to a significant increase in USAID's portfolio of countries that face various forms of fragility or crisis as well as an increase in demand for OTI's experience and programming methodology. As USAID's lead operational unit for crisis intervention programming, OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially-based technical advice and analysis, and explore countries that face possible political crises earlier in order to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and to be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.<br /> <br />As a member of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Yemen, Europe &amp; Eurasia, and Asia (YEA) team, the Senior Regional Specialist will be based in Thailand and will report to the Washington-based OTI YEA Team Leader. As the senior OTI representative in the field, the Senior Regional Specialist will represent and serve as a liaison between OTI and a wide array of individuals and institutions including USAID Field Missions, other DCHA office representatives, regionally based officials from the State Department, the Department of Defense, and other agencies of the U.S. Government, international organizations, and the non-government community abroad on political transition, conflict and post-conflict issues in the region. The Senior Regional Specialist will visit, as necessary, ongoing OTI programs in the region as well as proposed and potential country program sites, serving as OTI's senior official in the region, and may be called upon to support other regions as needed. The Senior Regional Specialist will serve as the agent of the OTI Team Leader and, when designated, will have supervisory authority when working with OTI country teams. This position will include extensive travel, particularly within the Asia and Eurasia region.<br /> <br />The Senior Regional Specialist will train, mentor, backstop, and support OTI country teams, including Country Representatives, Deputy Country Representatives, and other staff on the OTI business model, procedures, minimum program requirements, and best practices. He or she will help to determine the learning and training needs of in-country staff, and contribute to broader office policy and process discussions to promote state-of-the-art transition programming. Through coordination with OTI's Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) team, the Senior Regional Specialist will stay abreast of current thinking, policy determinations, lessons learned and best practices from other regions, while at the same time cultivating and sharing best practices found in the field. Through on-the-ground knowledge of OTI country programs, the Senior Regional Specialist will contribute to the refinement of OTI's learning and training strategy, training regimes, and materials for staff in country programs as well as office surge staff known as the Bullpen.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Senior Regional Specialist requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Senior Regional Specialist is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Yemen, Europe &amp; Eurasia, and Asia (YEA), with an additional direct line of reporting to the Director of the USAID Regional Development Mission, the OTI Senior Regional Specialist will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide technical assistance and support to regional and bilateral missions experiencing political transition, conflict, and post-conflict issues;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide expertise to OTI regional teams and the Senior Leadership Team on OTI strategic planning;</p>
<p>&bull;	Travel to current or potential OTI field locations and Washington, DC, if required, to provide expertise on OTI field programming through assessments, country program reviews, or consultations. Provide said consultations and assessments on best practices and lessons learned to develop guidance and training materials. Travel may also be required to attend regional conferences and workshops. Provide readouts when practicable and appropriate to the regional and Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) teams;</p>
<p>&bull;	Support ongoing OTI programs in the region on a temporary duty (TDY) or remote basis, including but not limited to serving as Acting Country Representative or Acting Deputy Country Representative when required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor regional developments related to OTI's mission and mandate. Provide ongoing analysis and regular reporting to the Regional Team Leader on current political developments, security concerns and other pertinent information from the region for informed decision-making;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, lead and/or contribute to assessments for possible new country start-ups, and steer new country analysis for OTI;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure effective and well-managed OTI country programs by performing independent analysis of program operations, and helping to mentor, train, and provide consultation to the Country Representative, Deputy Country Representative, and other members of in-country Senior Management Teams (including implementing partner staff where appropriate) on OTI's business model, programming methodology, applicable historical references, observed personal and corporate lessons. Advise at strategic, programmatic and activity levels to ensure the overall success of OTI programs in the region;</p>
<p>&bull;	Actively support learning and training in OTI by linking, contributing to, and refining observed lessons and best practices from the field, program, and personnel requirements to the main body of OTI knowledge through the ABC team;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OTI's representative, regional focal point and liaison for new country start-ups, strategic analysis and dialogue with senior U.S. Government officials and representatives throughout the region;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide advice to the OTI Regional Team Leader about the direction and implementation of country programs, and the performance of in-country staff. Work with the Regional Team Leader and relevant country teams to devise strategies for the improvement and success of OTI programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by Embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick-impact programming model. Support to Embassies and USAID Missions may also include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming including but not limited to rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance reviews and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as assigned by OTI/Washington in support of OTI's worldwide mission, including other representational duties in support of OTI programs if required.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Regional Specialist will be supervised by the Washington-based OTI Regional Team Leader for Yemen, Europe &amp; Eurasia, and Asia (YEA) or his/her designee as part of OTI's Field Programs Division, and will also have additional reporting responsibilities to the relevant Mission Director when applicable.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will provide administrative directions in terms of broadly defined missions or functions. The employee will independently plan, design and carry out programs, projects, studies or other work assignments. The employee's work will be considered technically authoritative and normally accepted without significant change, and will be reviewed in terms of fulfillment of program objectives or influence on the overall program.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on assessment teams, country start-ups, and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Partial bids are not permitted in the FedBid Marketplace. Partial bid means a bid submitted through the website by a seller, which does not qualify as an acceptable bid under a Reverse Auction because it does not include all required line items or other specifications. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Partial bids are not permitted in the FedBid Marketplace. Partial bid means a bid submitted through the website by a seller, which does not qualify as an acceptable bid under a Reverse Auction because it does not include all required line items or other specifications. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp. If internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC Level Protest Procedures. <BR> <BR>Sellers must present their representations and certifications, upon request, through the System for Award Management website at www.sam.gov. <BR> <BR>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

<p>Question:</p>
<p>So no FR garments for the electricians?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>In response to the inquiry regarding the use of special work shirts for the Elect Techs at our Port Isabel facility, the answer is "No". Our Elect Techs do not work with the electrical systems at our detention center. As such, they can wear the same type of work attire that the other uniformed employees wear (no special treatment is needed on the work shirt material).</p>

<p><br />Solicitation Number: 2014-31026A</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to evaluate the technical, economic and financial viability of a gas turbine combined cycle plant  ("Project") in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Province of Pakistan. This combined cycle plant would utilize a General Electric (GE) 9FB gas turbine that would produce 400-435 MW of electricity, employ one Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) and one steam turbine.</p>
<p>With the proposed gas turbine combined cycle power plant, PEDO seeks to diversity into thermal power generation taking advantage of the long term availability of natural gas in the Province. Being a provincial government agency PEDO is in a unique and advantageous position to develop this project.  The main objective of this gas turbine combined cycle plant  would be to eliminate load shedding in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p>
<p>The selected Contractor will evaluate the technical, economic and financial viability of a 400-435 MW gas-fired combined cycle plant  ("Project ")  that the Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization ("Grantee" or "PEDO") is developing on behalf of the provincial government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ("GoKP") in Pakistan.  This plant is anticipated to eventually be expanded to approximately double the initial capacity of 400-435 MW.  Assuming the plant's technical, economic, and financial viability are evaluated favorably, a secondary objective is to facilitate approval by a Panel of Experts (POE) at the Private Power and Infrastructure Board of Pakistan (PPIB), which is required before the Project can be implemented.  During the course of the Study, Contractor's deliverables in accordance with the tasks below should incorporate any comments received from the POE.  The Grantee shall be responsible for presenting the Study to the POE and for conveying any comments, suggestions or changes to the Contractor until the point of approval by the POE (within the timeframe established for the Study).</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$1,026,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  <br />To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>

Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>

<p>This notice serves as market research to gain industry comments on the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) and also serves as a pre-solicitation notice/procurement synopsis for the HAMMER Demonstration. This market research is for planning purposes and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any actual procurement of materials, machinery, or services.

Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. All costs associated with responding to this notice are solely at the responding parties' expense.</p>
<p>The objective is to develop and demonstrate a Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) defeat capability. The desired result is to demonstrate a capability to penetrate into representative targets with a BLU-109B 2,000 lb. class hard target penetrator warhead, dispense a payload of Kinetic Fireball Incendiaries (KFI), and defeat representative chemical and/or biological equipment and agent simulants while mitigating the release of any viable WMD simulants into the surrounding area.

The Government will not provide a hard copy of the RFP. Future information pertaining to this requirement will be posted on the FedBizOpps website. Interested parties should monitor the FedBizOpps website for changes.</p>

Upon verification of status and acknowledgement of responsibilities under U.S. export control laws and regulations, the requested technical data will be provided.</p>
<p>In response to the attached DRAFT RFP; the Government requests industry to provide any comments, questions and/or suggestions in an effort to improve the documents for the official RFP. Specifically, provide responses to the following:</p>
<p>a. How do you think this RFP format content affects your best proposal effort?<br />b. Are the CLIN descriptions clear and do you understand the use and purpose of knowledge points?<br />c.

Are section L and M clear?<br />e. If you are not provided budget information, can you still provide a reasonable estimate?<br />f. Provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate if you are willing to provide it.</p>
<p>Industry shall respond with comments, questions and/or suggestions to Erik Urban at erik.urban@us.af.mil and Diana Graziano at diana.graziano@us.af.mil NLT 7 Aug.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Prospective vendors must comply with all the requirements of the solicitation and its attachments to be considered responsive. The Government does not intend to hold discussion but may hold discussion if it is deemed necessary.

<DESC>1.0  Description   <br>  The Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Plans Programs & Resources) is  seeking capable and interested 8(a) small business sources  that could provide support to study, analyze, and provide recommendations for the size and competencies of the Army Acquisition Workforce.  Included in this effort are aspects of strategic planning coupled with analytic measures to create predictive resource staffing models, and competency management for human capital solutions.   <br>  The duration of this effort is anticipated to be 5 years  <br>    <br>  1.1  Request For Information (RFI) Only.   <br>  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. The RFI respondees are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website: https://www.fbo.gov and the GSA E-Commerce Central website: http://www.gsa.gov. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  <br>    <br>  2.0  Background   <br>  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology underwent a strategic review to determine how to best organize future manpower requirements. The review identified additional practices necessary to validate workload requirements that canbe adjusted quickly to meet changes in demand. A memorandum distributed by the Army Acquisition Executive directed the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Plans Programs & Resources (DASA PP&R) to lead three efforts: 1) Identify core capabilities, 2) Organize and determine staff for Life Cycle Management, and 3) Establish a flexible model to accommodate requirements and human resource issues. In so doing, DASA PP&R developed a Human Capital Strategic Plan that provides a consistent approach in identifying and validating detailed workloads and skill sets across the Acquisition workforce.  <br>    <br>  Currently, DASA PP&R has deployed PRSM for the Program Management (PM) function. The results and utility of the model prove to be a new paradigm on workload analysis. The PRSM methodology will continue to be used to build models for the Logistics, Contracting, Research & Development, Test, and Facilities Engineering functions. Ultimately, these functions will be integrated into a single tool used to predict workforce requirements across the Army acquisition workforce; ultimately gaining optimal staffing for future capabilities and skill sets. In order to provide recommendations, strategic planning and analytic measures will be used to develop optimal structures, tools (predictive resource staffing models), and human capital solutions, which will improve efficiencies across the acquisition workforce. The ODASA (PP&R) lacks analytic expertise to execute these tasks.  <br>    <br>  2.1 Delivery Date:  December 2014  <br>    <br>  2.2 Delivery Period and Condition: Delivery Period is anticipated to start 4QFY15.  <br>    <br>  2.3 Limitations: Not specified at this time.   <br>    <br>  2.4 Security Requirements:  Not specified at this time.   <br>    <br>  3.0  Requested Information   <br>  The requested information is to gain an understanding of the respondents knowledge, experience and competencies in the following areas:  <br>    <br>  Developing PREDICTION STAFFING MODELS for Federal Government Acquisition functions. Functions modeled may include but are not limited to Program Management, Logistics, Contracting, Research & Development, Test, and Facilities Engineering functions. Information on each functional model should include the areas listed below, as appropiate:  <br>    <br>  Data Collection and Analysis Methods. Describe methods, procedures, and products used to develop prediction staffing models.    <br>    <br>  Competency Modeling. Describe experience in, including, methods, procedures, and products, developing and integrating competencies into existing Prediction Staffing Models. For this response, competency is defined as the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to successfully perform the work required. The responses should also include information on sizes of populations modeled, level of effort required for each, and further explanations, as appropriate. If web-based software end products were developed as a part of the modeling efforts, please ensure responses identify them and summarize the capabilities provided.    <br>    <br>  4.0 Responses   <br>  Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a whitepaper.   <br>    <br>  4.1 RFI Whitepaper. The RFI whitepaper should be in Microsoft Word for Office 2007 compatible format and due NLT Dec 04, 2014. The whitepaper response is limited to 5 single-sided pages and submitted via e-mail only to the Government Point of Contract (POC): paulette.a.mcgoldrick.civ@mail.mil  <br>    <br>   The RFI whitepaper should address the following:   <br>    <br>  Proprietary information, if any, should be kept to minimum and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED.   <br>  To aid the Government, segregate proprietary information. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. If any respondee does not currently have a Proprietary Data Protection Agreement  (PDPA) that would permit the Government's personnel to review and evaluate the submitted whitepaper in response to this RFI, the respondee should request to sign PDPAs with the Government.   <br>    <br>  Please note that all government or contractor personnel have executed Non Disclosure Agreements (NDA) for all project information related to the Human Capital Initiative.   <br>  The RFI whitepaper should provide the following information:   <br>    <br>  1.Company Information.

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and award through full and open competition, several Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the purpose of procuring Manpack Radios for the Full Rate Production (FRP) phase of the program.  Manpack Radios will enable communications through seamless, high speed and digital information exchange across both vertical and horizontal hierarchies within the battlespace that supports ground, airborne and maritime domains. The Manpack Radio will support all domains for dismounted and mounted communications as a multi-functional communications platform. The Manpack Radio will provide two independent, multi-waveform channels as a software defined radio with an embedded Selective Availability Anti Spoofing Module (SAASM) to enable radios to transmit their locations to external host applications.    <br>         <br>    The current Manpack Radio requirements are stated in the Capability Production Document (CPD) for Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Version 2.4 dated 5 April 2012 and approved on 20 May 2012.  The Government intends to procure existing and Non-Developmental Items that meet the Manpack Radio capabilities as described in the PRD.    <br>        <br>    The purpose of this RFI is to survey the ability of vendors' anticipated offerings for the Full Rate Production Manpack Radio to meet proposed changes to CPD mission weight, battery life, and range requirements.  Interested sources are encouraged to provide responses to the attached Request for Information (RFI).   This is a completely voluntary questionnaire intended to guide the Government when planning final performance requirements for the Manpack.      <br>              <br>    This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Final Solicitation or a promise to issue a Final Solicitation in the future. This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at the interested parties' expense.  Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future Final Solicitation, if issued.      <br>        <br>    If a Final Solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  If your company is interested in this planned procurement, then it is advised that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at HTTP://WWW.FBO.GOV.     <br>        <br>    The above discussed intent is subject to change.     <br>      <br>   ---Change 1---    <br>       <br>   The purpose of this change is to provide an updated Manpack Radio request for information document for proposed CPD changes.

<DESC>sYNOPSIS AMENDMENT 0001:<br /><br />
<p>Amendment 0001 - Amendment 0001 is issued to resynopsize the requirement in its entirety.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates the award of a three-year Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for H60 Avionics Forward Firing Weapons System Support in the estimated amount of $30M. The contract will include firm-fixed-price line items for hardware to include Interface Unit, Automatic Data Processing (IUADP) Technical Insertion Program (TIP) (P/N 3392AS2500), Weapon Control Panel (WCP) (P/N 3392AS1816), Rocket Control Unit (RCU) (P/N 3392AS2430), Gun Control Unit (GCU) (P/N 3392AS1840), Booster Motor Assembly (BMA) (P/N 3392AS1856), AN/USM-714 Test Program Set (P/N 7450688-1). In addition to procuring the MH-60 Weapon Systems hardware, a cost-plus fixed-fee line item will be included in the contract for engineering and logistics sustainment support; travel will be cost only.</p>
<p>The contract will be awarded on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Science Applications International, Corporation (SAIC) is the only manufacturer with the requisite knowledge and expertise to support the system. Additionally, the Government owns one set of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) that was designed and developed by SAIC under a competitive contract. The GFE is required for all phases of the build of assemblies and sub-assemblies, and is also required to test and maintain the MH-60 Weapons System, and is currently being utilized by SAIC to support a SeaPort contract; funding does not exist to procure an additional set of GFE.</p>
<p>Alpha contracting procedures will be utilized and a formal solicitation will not be issued. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal which will be considered by this agency. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The POC is Ms. Diane L. Pearson, Code 023, Phone (812) 854-5201, or email: diane.pearson@navy.mil. Reference the above solicitation number when responding to this notice.</p>

<DESC><p>Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, intends to negotiate a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract for Argent Guardian software in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 15.2, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. The contract will be awarded to Argent Software, Inc. Market research was previously conducted and it has been determined that this is a sole source requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. All interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide timely and effective services within two (2) days of this publication. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted with only one respondent able to meet the government's needs due to the information being proprietary: Argent Software, Inc. Ms. Jill Willingham, AFLCMC/AQP, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, 45433, has been appointed as Ombudsman to hear concerns from offerors, or potential offerors, during the proposal development. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. Existence of the Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer. Accordingly, the Ombudsman does not participate in the preparation of solicitations, the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process and, therefore, for routine matters on individual solicitations, please contact the buyer at the telephone number listed herein. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. Any questions regarding this acquisition should be directed to the Contract Negotiator, John Fisher at (937) 656-7455 or e-mail: john.fisher.36@us.af.mil. Should you desire to contact the Ombudsman, Ms. Jill Willingham can be reached at (937) 255-5472, e-mail: jill.willingham@wpafb.af.mil.</p>

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: VA San Juan needs to conduct emergency installation of HEP Filters at the HVAC line that serves Ward 2K of the South Bed Tower and make a TAB once completed. This is a new requirement to be processed as a Firm Fixed Price one time job. 
3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: The vendor must provide and install a filter frame for the return duct and HEPA filters for the return and supply systems. Once completed the Contractor must test and Balance the area (ward 2K of the South Bed Tower).  
Total Estimated is $17,800.
This emergency service is for the creation of a Ward to attend suspected patients with the Ebola Virus that have to be quarantine. 
4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: FAR 6.302-2 (b)(2) Unusual and compelling urgency.

Engineering work needs to be done to mitigate and prevent further exposure to the virus.

MASE is already working with the Maintenance of the Air Handling Units; this job is a logical extension of that work since they already are in the facility and poses all requirements to access the Facility. They are the only firm capable of providing the supplies described in Section III above without the Veteran's Health Administration experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements. These changes to the HVAC system are needed at once to preclude impairment of healthcare delivery capabilities or mission performance in case of a patient contaminated with the Ebola Virus.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: This situation is considered an emergency and prompt attention is a required delaying repair will create a situation where an outbreak of Ebola may happen to patient, guest or employees.
Prior authorization was obtained to process this emergency and is filled on the briefcase under P11 approve emergency order.  
10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: See section VI above
11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: Facility is working with the Ward to make a long term care unit for any other outbreak. 
12.
