This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price, technical and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT FOR SOLE SOURCE
Advion Automated Nanoelectrospray Infusion Unit

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in Research Triangle Park, NC, intends to award a sole source purchase order under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Advion, Inc. to purchase an Automated Nanoelectrospray Infusion Unit.
The Advion NanoMate System possesses the following unique features: 
The Advion TriVersa NanoMate is the only fully automated and robotic nanoelectrospray system. 
The system is the only automated chip-based nano-electrospray (nESI) ion source available. It allows in depth analysis of complex samples, using very little material, and can be automated, resulting in greater productivity from the mass spectrometer it is installed on.
The system has zero sample to sample carry over - ideal for samples such as lipids, etc. This gives greater data integrity. It is the only system that can do this. 
There are no other distributors. Advion is the only supplier and manufacturer.
The circumstance permitting is FAR 13.106-1(b) "Soliciting from a single source".  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 10 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation is available.  Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will be ignored.  The information received to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please submit response ONLY to Sammie Jones at jones.sammie@epa.gov.  No telephone or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC><br />Synopsis:<br />The purpose of this announcement is to request updated and new A&amp;E qualification information for the USDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station (SRS)/Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNW)/Pacific Southwest Research Station (PSW) Administration Zone (AZ) Architect &amp; Engineer (A&amp;E) Short Selection Database. This is a sources sought for future projects with no specific project planned at this time.
<p>WHAT IS THE SHORT SELECTION DATABASE USED FOR?<br />The Forest Service utilizes the Short Selection database to award Architect-Engineer (AE) contracts, below $150,000, in all States included within the Forest Service Southern Research Station, (including the States of: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawai'i, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington State). The headquarters for SRS/PNW/PSW is located in Asheville, NC and all files and short list database will be located at the SRS headquarters. The database contains all of the qualified, interested AE firms that respond to this notice for consideration for future approved projects falling within the NAICS codes indicated. Examples of some of the types of work include, but is not limited to, laboratory repairs and renovations, design of small warehouses and offices, historic preservation, renovations to improve energy efficiency and address safety concerns, energy audits and studies, design of repairs to small dams and impoundments, design of photovoltaic and other renewable energy systems, green building construction and certification consultation, review and design of HVAC systems upgrades and replacements, review and design of electrical systems, construction inspection, drafting services, surveying (construction and property), geotechnical investigation, and environmental (RCRA, CECRLA, CWA, etc.) investigations, reviews, inventories, audits and coordination of RCRA and other waste disposal.<br />There is an average of 20 firms listed in our database each year. On an annual basis, SRS/PNW/PSW averages six (6) task orders (two task orders in SRS, two task orders in PNW, and two task orders in PSW) focused in the following areas: green building construction and certification consultation, review and design of HVAC systems upgrades and replacements, review and design of electrical systems, and laboratory repairs and renovations. The average cost per task order was approximately $12,000.00.</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE SHORT SELECTION PROCESS?<br />The Short Selection Process utilizes the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36.602-5.<br /><br />For AE projects with an estimated total fee under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (currently $150,000) agencies may review current date files for eligible AE firms, perform a technical review and evaluation to determine the three (3) most highly qualified firms, and have discussions with the three (3) firms to determine the best qualified firm for that particular project. A price proposal will then be requested from the highest technically rated firm. If a reasonable price cannot be negotiated, discussions will be held with the second best qualified firm, and so on. The AE's ability to provide licensed professionals in the State where the project is located (FAR 36.602-1(a)(1) and the firm's geographic proximity and knowledge of the local area (FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)) as identified on the AE's SF330 and supplemental information, will be used for the first preliminary screening of firms when a large list of potential firms exist.<br />Large Businesses may submit SF330s; however, all acquisitions utilizing the short selection database shall be set-aside for small business concerns unless requirements cannot be met and the Contracting Officer obtains a proper waiver. The A-E database will be maintained with filters for State, Zip Code, NAICS Codes, Small Business Size, and Small Business Socio-Economic Classification. <br />The sources sought due date is listed below; SF330s are valid for one year from the date of notification that your firm has been added to the short list database. Firms are encouraged to update their data annually by responding to this announcement; however, the Forest Service will retain previously submitted data for a period of three years.</p>
<p>WHAT DOES MY FIRM NEED TO SUBMIT TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY AND RECEIVE CONSIDERATION FOR FUTURE AE PROJECTS?<br />Submittals shall be brief and concise. Only the first fifty (50) pages of your response will be retained. Initial review would determine if a firm is minimally qualified to do work for the Federal Government as described in the synopsis. After initial evaluation, minimally qualified firms will be listed in the short selection database and the first 50 pages of their submittal package placed on file. <br />As specific projects arise, the short selection database will be used to pull a list of qualified firms that can perform the needed work at the specific location. At that point, the submittal package for those specific firms will be pulled from the file and used to perform a technical review as described in the synopsis. <br />The following information is required and is part of the 50 page limit:<br />1. A cover letter should be included with all other data. The letter should outline the work your firm specializes in and include a brief description of your firm's capabilities specifically relating to the project examples stated above.<br />2. Attachment A - A&amp;E Submittal Cover Sheet.<br />3. Attachment B - SF330, Parts 1 and 2 (6 pages). Part 2 of the SF330 includes a list of the number of licensed professionals and the States of their licensing for each of the Function codes identified in block 9 of Part 2 of the SF330. https://www.gsa.gov/reference/forms?search_keyword=330 <br />4. Print Out of your System for Award Management (SAM) record. SAM registration is required for award of federal contracts and to be considered for project work. All NAICS Codes listed in this Sources Sought must be listed on your SAM record. Contractors may register in SAM at www.sam.gov. Registration is free of charge to all Government Contractors.</p>
<p>Please note: FAR 36.602-1(a) requires "Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services", but does not specifically require that a license be held in every state covered by this synopsis. However, the respondent should be familiar with requirements specific to the different locations and be available to travel to the location for any necessary site visits.</p>
<p>All information shall be submitted via mail or email (not both). Email is preferred; the email address is kfriot@fs.fed.us. Reference the sources sought number and title in the email Subject Line. If mailed, reference the sources sought number and title on the envelope and mail to:</p>

Scope:
Introduction

The purpose of this project is to rehabilitate the historic Trading Post, also known as KozlowskiÂ¿s Trading Post, to provide for adaptive reuse of the existing building for visitor contact, interpretation, and offices for park staff. The Trading Post consists of approximately 5,098 gross square feet (building footprint) and approximately 3,818 square feet of net usable area. About 70 percent of the building will be rehabilitated for visitor use, consisting of a visitor contact area, interpretation and/or display areas and public restrooms. The remaining 30 percent will be rehabilitated for office space for park staff. The existing space must accommodate all equipment, such as HVAC, electrical, etc. No additions to the existing building are proposed. The exterior of the building and site will provide setting and features consistent with the significance of the property and the parkÂ¿s interpretive goals for enhancing the overall visitor experience of the Trading Post.

This building is an example of a typical Northern New Mexico vernacular adobe building. It is a low (one story), sprawling, U-shaped building, which began as a 600 square foot, one-room structure and grew through a series of additions to approximately 5,000 square feet. The building is listed on the NPS List of Classified Structures (LCS), and has been Â¿Determined EligibleÂ¿ for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, with a national significance.

Location
The project is located within Pecos National Historical Park in San Miguel County, New Mexico, approximately 30 miles east of Santa Fe via automobile.

Scope of Construction
Work of this project includes correction and mitigation of site deficiencies, and complete stabilization, repair, rehabilitation, modification and/or replacement of the structure, fabric, and features of the building, including the roof, roof drainage system and roof structure; exterior portals; adobe and stone walls; foundations; doors, windows, trim, and other exposed wood features; floor systems, including framing and finishes; interior finishes; mechanical, plumbing and electrical systems; and fire suppression system. In addition, the building will be treated to eliminate or control pests such as termites, beetles, and rodents. The building will be brought into compliance with health and life safety, building code and other regulatory requirements, as appropriate. The estimated price range for the work described herein is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.
The Trading Post is an historic building of national significance.

Classification Code:				NAICS Code:
Z						238290

Synopsis:

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is conducting a market survey/request for information to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, 8(a) qualified small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and Historically Underutilized Business Zone small businesses capable of providing the requirement below.  This market survey/request for information announcement is not a request for proposals, and the Government is not committed to issue a solicitation or award a contract pursuant to this announcement or based on responses to this announcement.  The information from this market research is only for planning purposes, and will assist the Government in its acquisition strategy.  As such, the Government will not entertain questions concerning this synopsis, and will not pay any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this market survey or the Governmentâs use of the information.  Proprietary information must be clearly identified as proprietary information.

SSA has a requirement for a Contractor to provide all supervision, labor, equipment, tools, supplies and materials for the installation of 48-inch toe guards (aka aprons or platform guards) on ten elevator cars at the Frank Hagel Federal Building, 1221 Nevin Avenue, Richmond, CA 94801. 

Frank Hagel Federal Building is a seven-story office building for the Social Security Administration. The building contains eight passenger elevators and two freight elevators, all built by Haughton Elevator Company in 1975. The passenger elevators are gearless traction rated at 4000 pounds, with 4-foot door openings. The freight elevators are geared traction rated at 8000 pounds, with 6-foot door openings. As-built plans are available for reference. The Contractor must verify all measurements.

The Contractor shall perform the following work:

â¢	Evaluate and determine the proper toe guards to be installed per the latest version of ASME A17.1 Elevator Safety Code.
â¢	Purchase and install the toe guards and all necessary support hardware and other parts.
â¢	Annotate the installation in the elevator maintenance logs in the machines rooms.

The Contractor shall submit with its proposal a schedule of parts and materials to be installed. All parts and materials must be new; no used, rebuilt and refurbished materials shall be used.

It is the responsibility of the Contractor to determine and comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and local ordinances. All required permit fees will be included in the bid price. All design, installation and service shall comply with ASME A17.1 Elevator Safety Code and other industry standards, as applicable. 

2. WORK HOURS

Normal working hours for the building are 6 AM to 6 PM, Monday through Friday. Work may be performed during normal hours if it does not cause excessive noise, fumes or other conditions that are disruptive to the office workplace. Hot work (welding, soldering, metal cutting, etc.) must be performed outside normal working hours and must be approved in advance by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR). The Contractor agrees to perform services with as little disruption to the building operations as possible.

3. COORDINATION 

The Contractor shall coordinate working hours and work locations with the Contracting Officerâs Representative (COR). Only one passenger elevator on each side of the building may be placed out of service at any time. Only one freight elevator may be placed out of service at any time. 

4. SAFETY AND CLEANLINESS

The Contractor shall ensure that the work area is kept clean and free of debris to maintain a safe working environment. The Contractor shall provide dust covers, temporary barriers, pads, etc. as required to protect the building occupants and contents while performing work. Floors, walls and ceilings, including elevators, shall be adequately protected to prevent marring, scratching or other damage. Upon completion of the work, all surfaces involved shall be clean of dirt, smudges and debris. The Contractor shall remove all waste materials from the work site and dispose as required to maintain a safe working environment.

The Contractor is responsible for any damage caused by the Contractor to the building and its contents. Such damage shall be repaired or items replaced by the Contractor to the satisfaction of the Government.

All tools, equipment and other materials belonging to the Contractor shall be removed from the work location at the end of each working day. Limited on-site storage space for materials will be provided upon request and coordinated with the COR. The Government shall not be responsible for the loss or damage of the Contractorâs equipment, tools and materials. 

5. WARRANTY

The Contractor shall supply a one year warranty on all parts and workmanship, in addition to any manufacturerâs warranty.

6. ASBESTOS NOTIFICATION

Asbestos-containing materials (ACM) have been identified in the following locations inside the Frank Hagel Federal Building:

â¢ Hanger and bracket cuffs of various sizes on the piping throughout the building.  
â¢ Joint compound applied to dry wall/sheet rock seams throughout the building.
â¢ Black conduit cap putty is located in conduits throughout the building.
â¢ Black floor tile mastic associated with the 12â X 12â cream-color floor tiles.

The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that contract employees do not damage or disturb ACM and that all contract employees exercise caution when working near ACM. The Contractor must immediately report damaged ACM to the COR. All contract employees must be trained in Asbestos Awareness. Training records shall be provided to the Government upon request.

The  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238290 and the size standard is $15M.

Interested firms with the capability of providing the requirement, per applicable subcontracting rule limitations (e.g., those in FAR 52.219-3 and 52.219-14), shall submit capability statements that demonstrate their expertise in the above-described areas in sufficient detail, including any other specific and relevant information, so the Government can determine the firmâs experience and capability to provide the requirements.  Failure to demonstrate the capability of providing the requirement in response to this market survey may affect the Governmentâs review of the industryâs ability to perform or provide these requirements.    

In addition to capability statements, firms must include this information in their responses: (1)  organization name, address, email address, website address, and telephone number; (2) size and type  of ownership and socioeconomic designation for the organization [i.e. small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), etc.]; and 3)  business experiences.

<p>FY16 MCAF KNMD043004, Fighter Alert Facility, Joint Base Pearl Harbor- Hickam (JBPHH), Oahu, Hawaii<br /><br />Project Description: FY16 MCAF KNMD043004, Fighter Alert Facility, Joint Base Pearl Harbor - Hickam (JBPHH), Oahu, Hawaii. This firm-fixed price design-bid-build (DBB) construction project is to construct a fully designed aircraft shelter, parking apron, taxiway for thirteen (13) F-22 aircraft, alter crew quarter building, sentry aloha building, entry control point building, security fences and gates, parking lot lighting, stripping, asphalt paving, aircraft Hush House foundation, Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) pavement structure, hot mix asphalt shoulders, airfield and taxiway lightings, security fencing, lighting, gates, generator, demolition, grading, pavement markings, grounding points, tie downs, airfield lighting, relocation of existing utilities, and new utilities power, a/c systems, water, storm drain, sewer systems, communications voice and data, fire hydrant system, and miscellaneous appurtenances and system control to include 3rd party certification, commissioning of mechanical components, O&amp;M manuals, and etc. The magnitude of this project is estimated to be between $25M and $50M.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>FAR 22.503 Policy provides that:</p>
<p>(a) PLAs are a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of PLAs in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of PLAs will--</p>
<p>(1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>(2) Be consistent with law. (Refer also to FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for PLA and FAR 52.222-34 PLA).<br />(c) Agencies may also consider the following factors in deciding whether the use of a PLA is appropriate for the construction project:<br />(1) The project will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades.<br />(2) There is a shortage of skilled labor in the region in which the construction project will be sited.<br />(3) Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br />(4) PLAs have been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of the project.<br />(5) A PLA will promote the agency's long term program interests, such as facilitating the training of a skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs.<br />(6) Any other factors that the agency decides are appropriate.<br />In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs for this requirement. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions and tables:</p>
<p>1. Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind? If so, please provide supporting documentation?</p>
<p>2. Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project? If so please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>3. Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would impact the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>4. Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p>5. Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p>6. Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>7. Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>Please include information on projects completed in the last 2-5 years -</p>
<p>a. Project Name / Location Detailed Project Description<br />b. Initial Cost Est. / Actual final cost<br />c. Was the project completed on-time?<br />d. Number of craft trades present on the project<br />e. PLA (Y/N)<br />f. Were there any challenges experienced during project? (delays, investigations, health and safety issues, labor shortages, management / organizational issues, etc)</p>
<p>Please provide your project specific comments via e-mail to Ruthie Washington, at Clarinda.R.Washington@usace.army.mil and Curtis Chang, at Curtis.C.Chang@usace.army.mil no later than November 29, 2017 at 2:00 p.m., Hawaii Standard Time.</p>
<p>This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Summary of Scope of Work</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to make further improvements to the oil spill prevention and oil accountability systems of Dworshak Dam. The drainage system collects water from rain and leakage into a drainage sump and transformer sump. This water includes water that runs into floor drains, water that leaks into the turbine pit and water from the transformer deluge system. Water from floor drains in certain areas as well as water from the turbine pit has a high probability of being mixed with oil. This project will install an oil skimmer in both the drainage and transformer sumps to remove oil from the drainage system. Removing oil from the drainage system will improve oil spill prevention and oil accountability at Dworshak Dam.</p>
<p>The contractor will install a floating oil skimmer in both the drainage and transformer sumps. Oil and water from the skimmers will be pumped into oil/water separator tanks that will also temporarily store the oil. Hydrocarbon sensors will be installed in both sumps and will control the operation of the skimmers. New ultrasonic level sensors will be used to monitor and control levels in the drainage sump to provide an optimal level for the skimmer. The contractor will also install baffling in the drainage sump where the main drainage flows enter and extend the other inflow pipes such that they discharge behind baffling as well. A 24" core drill will be needed in the top of the transformer sump to install the skimmer and sensors.</p>
<p>Contractors is required to follow the procedures in the Army Corps of Engineers Safety Manual, which can be found online at http://www.usace.army.mil/Safetyand OccupationalHealth.aspx located at US Army Corps of Engineers homepage.</p>
<p>Submit this information to cynthia.h.jacobsen@usace.army.mil, Contract Specialist, via email. Your response to this notice must be received on or before 2:00 PM Pacific Time on November 30, 2017.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br />THIS IS A Sources Sought Notice ONLY.

Accordingly, the U.S. Government highly encourages all interested businesses (large and small) to respond to this sources sought synopsis.  In addition, small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantage Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business concerns), must describe their identifying capabilities in meeting the requirements at a fair market price, i.e., information which may help support a set-aside.
<p>The proposed sole source firm-fixed-price contract to D-Co, Leader and Training, LLC is for highly qualified, former Special Operations Forces (SOF) subject matter experts on Subterranean Operations (SbTO) to conduct instruction and training to Army units on SbTO as part of the MCoE's SbTO Mobile Training Teams (MTTs).  The statutory authority for the sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

<p>This notice does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ, IFB or RFP in the future.  This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service.  Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this sources sought notice.  The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice.  Submittals will not be returned to the responder.  A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  However, if a competitive solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Government wide Point of Entry.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Government wide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement.

<p>3.  Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for this requirement as a prime contractor or not.  Identify subcontracting, joint ventures or teaming arrangement that will be pursued, if any.</p>
<p>4.

<SOLNBR>89303518NEM000001
<ARCHDATE>11302017
<CONTACT>HOUK, HEATHER M.
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT / REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
Title: Oak Ridge Reservation Cleanup Contract
Date: November 13, 2017
THIS RFI IS NOT A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP). IT IS A MARKET SURVEY ISSUED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SOURCES, AND ENGAGE IN EXCHANGES WITH INDUSTRY AS CONTEMPLATED BY FAR 15.201(e).
The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Oak Ridge Office of Environmental Management (OREM) is seeking qualified businesses (including limited liability companies, joint ventures or other similar team arrangements) to perform environmental clean-up on the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) including decontamination and demolition (D&D), remediation, waste treatment and disposal operations, and other environmental clean-up support activities. The ORR includes the Y-12 National Security Complex (Y-12), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP). The DOE is exploring options to identify the most effective contract type for this effort. The anticipated type of contract, period of performance, amount of funding, or set aside possibilities are to be determined. The estimated cost for this contract is in the range of $2-5 billion over 10 years. The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this scope is 562910. This announcement is part of market research and responses are sought to identify sources that have the comprehensive knowledge, skills, and capacity to perform these requirements.
The cleanup scope includes decontamination, decommissioning, and demolition of hazardous and radioactively contaminated facilities at Y-12 and ORNL, and environmental media remediation across the ORR. The facility D&D scope includes planning, characterization, deactivation of utilities, asbestos and other hazardous material abatement, equipment dismantlement, structure demolition and waste treatment and/or disposal at Y-12 and ORNL. The Y-12 cleanup and facility D&D scope will be performed primarily in the West End Mercury Area, encompassing the Beta 4, Alpha 5 and Alpha 4 Buildings and ancillary facilities. These are large scale (averaging 502,000 sf) 1950s vintage facilities that were historically used for lithium enrichment operations that utilized large quantities of mercury. These facilities were also associated with uranium production activities. As such, mercury contamination is present as well as uranium, beryllium (primarily in Alpha 5) and other chemicals. In addition, the ORNL cleanup and facility D&D scope will be performed primarily in the former isotope production, research reactor, and other laboratory facilities located in the Central Campus. Most of these facilities are nuclear facilities contaminated with a variety of radioisotopes, including transuranic isotopes, and chemicals.
The scope includes environmental media remediation planning/execution activities at the three ORR sites.
In addition to the above noted D&D and remediation activities, the contractor shall execute certain Environmental Management operations at ORNL and Y-12. These include the operation
and maintenance of gaseous and waste water treatment systems to ensure capability is available to accept, treat, and dispose of wastes generated by ongoing research and development, environmental restoration, D&D, and other DOE missions. The contractor will also be responsible for treatment and/or disposition of legacy low and mixed low-level waste.
The contractor shall construct a new Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) low level waste landfill and shall operate and maintain the new and existing landfills. The contractor shall also operate and maintain the ORR Landfills (i.e. sanitary/industrial, construction/demolition debris, and classified landfills) located at the Y-12 Site, which receive waste from across the ORR, and construct landfill expansions as needed. Operations shall be conducted in compliance with environmental permits issued to the facilities or per Federal Facility Agreements.
The contractor shall also perform risk reduction actions and surveillance and maintenance of Environmental Management facilities at Y-12 and ORNL, including the Transuranic (TRU) Waste Processing Center and related TRU waste storage facilities at ORNL, as well as limited operations to support shipments of remaining TRU waste to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP).
In addition, the contractor will be responsible for general program activities necessary to support the specific work listed above, including project management, reindustrialization support, post closure/long-term stewardship, and environmental monitoring. The contractor will be required to be a participating employer/sponsor in the Multi-Employer Pension Plan (MEPP) and Multi-Employer Welfare Arrangement (MEWA) and to function as the lead sponsor in those plans.
Interested companies are requested to submit a capability statement, of no more than 10 pages and no smaller than 12 point font, showing their teamâs experience and capability to perform the above requirements. The capability statement must include the following:
1. A statement describing the companyâs interest in performing the proposed requirements.
2. A general description of the companyâs capacity to perform a subsequent contract for the proposed requirements taking into consideration the contracts/projects it is currently performing;
3. Socio-economic status (small business, service-disabled/veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and/or woman-owned small business, or large business). Small business teams shall identify the socio-economic status of each team partner.
4. A general description regarding what proposed requirements will be performed by the company and what, if any, of the proposed requirements will be performed by any team partners in a subsequent contract for this work.
5. A description of recent contract/project experience performed within the last five years for both the company and any proposed team partners, if applicable, to include the following (please limit to one page per contract/project):
a. The size (dollar value), duration, scope, and complexity of the contract/project. Specific areas of scope and complexity would be demolition and operational responsibility of similar facilities (to include the assumption and management of facility safety basis requirements) and preparation and DOE approval of nuclear safety, radiological safety, and worker safety program documentation;
b. The type of contract (i.e., fixed price, cost reimbursement, etc.);
c. Identification of the companyâs role as either a prime or subcontractor; and
d. Identification of a contract or project number and point of contact and contact information (name, address, and phone) at the agency or prime contractorâs organization.
6. A synopsis of financing arrangements available to support performance under a contract with an anticipated annual value of approximately $200-$500 million.
Standard company brochures may be included with your response, but will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought/RFI alone. Submission of a capability statement does not commit an interested party to submit a proposal. All responses received will be treated as source selection information and will not be released to the public. DOE reserves the right to use any and all information submitted by, or obtained from, an interested party in any manner DOE determines is appropriate, including, but not limited to, the creation of a competitive solicitation.

<DESC>The Enterprise Program proposes to procure by means of other than full and open competition Warehouse Services for the National Map Store under a "bridge" contract.
<p>The FS National Map store is relocating from a leased facility in Montana to a new facility in Portland Oregon. The lease of the new facility is being transferred from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) where warehouse services were being provided under a BLM contract. The intent of this contract action is to obtain short term support while the Forest Service accomplishes hiring actions for Government personnel to take over the warehouse. Utilizing a bridge ensures personnel with existing knowledge of the warehouse facility will be able to oversee the installation and warehousing of materials moved from Montana. It would not be plausible to train new personnel and meet the required November 1st desired start date.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) intends to negotiate and award a sole source task order to Kearney &amp; Company, 1701 Duke Street, Suite 500, Alexandria VA 22314-3492, under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program, the statutory authorities for which are Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251, et seq.) and Title 40 U.S.C. 501, Services for Executive Agencies. to provide support to the SF Claims Branch (Task I) and the SF Acquired Assets Branch (Task II) in the SF Post Insurance Division. The following support services are required for Task I: provide document control, distribute and deliver batched of FHA claims; process suspended FHA claims; and prepare and process requests for manual and held payments. Support services for Task II consist of marketing activities of the SF Property Disposition. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provides insurance for private lenders against loss on financing single family homes. Single Family is the component of FHA that insures mortgages on dwellings for one to four families. When a homeowner defaults on a single-family FHA insured mortgage, the mortgagee presents a claim for insurance benefits to SF Post Insurance Division (PID), SF Claims Branch (SFCB). Lenders submit Form HUD-27011, Application for SF Insurance Benefits (parts A-E) for this purpose. The claims are submitted primarily via electronic data interchange, but some lenders choose to submit paper originals. Claim payments are made through the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury). The SF Claims Branch has two (2) Sections: The Financial Operations and Control Section (FOC), and the Review and Compliance Section (RCS). FOC is responsible for selected accounting activities, such as: processing manual payment requests, collections, administrative offsets, disbursements, and reissued payments; updating the accounts receivable; receiving, reviewing, routing and delivering mail (correspondence and claims) for the Branch; and maintaining files of claim source document forms. RCS is responsible for reviewing and processing supplemental and suspended claims (claims that fail A43C system edits). RCS is also a resource for technical guidance and direction on the proper submission of claims Additional requirements imposed on lenders providing FHA insured mortgages (such as the requirement to employ loss mitigation tools designed to help mortgagors retain ownership of their homes) result in an additional workload related to loss mitigation claims. The Branch receives numerous telephone and written inquiries from clients, i.e., mortgagees, HUD Field Office and Home Ownership Center (HOC) representatives, Headquarters staff, and servicing agents. Delays in processing claims and responding to inquiries due to high volume can cause the Department to incur greater costs because of extended time frames for calculation of interest. These delays result in higher claim payments and a decrease in customer satisfaction as to the timeliness of services provided to them. Increasing volumes of claims and monitoring activities directly impact on the Branch's capability to process claims in a timely manner. Document Control, Distribution, and Delivery; Processing of Single Family Mortgage Insurance Claims; Manual and Held Payments. Task II - Single Family Acquired Asset Management System (Sam's) Servicing Sam's Is a Hud Operated Management And Accounting System In a HUD controlled automated processing environment. The system maintains approximately 60,000 profiles of payees who perform services required to hold, market, and sell HUD's single-family property inventory. Profiles of approximately 9,000 local taxing authorities and information for approximately 100 lessees/leases are also maintained in the system. Approximately 1,000 global file maintenance activities are processed per month. The system disburses approximately $250 million annually via check and Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) for services, expenses, and property taxes for these properties. A. Global File Maintenance: Customer Service Help Desk; Collections; IRS Bulk TIN Matching. The period of performance is for a 9-month base period plus 3-month option periods. The NAICS code is 541219 and the size standard is 20.50. This notice is not a request for competitive quotations. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may submit a written response via email to Brenda Lee at the email address below by 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on November 20, 2015 Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Information received will be considered; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, HUD will proceed with the sole source award to Kearney&amp; Company. The anticipated award date of this requirement is around November 22, 2017. No collect calls will be accepted. If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Brenda K. Lee at brenda.k.lee@hud.gov

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION FAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 3304 (a) (1)
San Francisco Public Utilities Commission  PR 8985-000009

 Agency and Contracting Activity Identification: The National Cemetery Administration (NCA), Pacific District, 1301 Clay Street, Suite 1230 North, Oakland CA 94612-5209, as directed by the NCA Golden Gate National Cemetery will enter into an agreement that requires justification for other than full and open competition procedures.

Nature of Acquisition Being Approved: Golden Gate National Cemetery yearly water services. Award shall be made through other than full and open competition to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission who is the local government body and the sole water service provider for the area.

Description of Requirement: The awarded contractor is to provide Water services. The period of performance shall be from October 01, 2017 through September 30, 2018. The estimated
cost is $600,000.00.

Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: The Services are being procured under the authority of:

(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
( ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
( ) (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
( ) (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
( ) (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5; ( ) (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
( ) (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: FAR Part 6.302-1(a) When the agency s need for the supplies or services can be provided by only one source. Market research indicates that there more than one company that provides water services. However, the San
Francisco Public Utilities Commission is an affilliate of the City and County of San Mateo and San Francisco and is the only authorized provider for water in the area in which the Golden Gate National Cemetery resides. There are no other known water providers that can perform the same services for the Golden Gate National Cemetery.
A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.   A notice shall be posted in accordance with FAR part 5 procedures.




Page 1 of 2



Anticipated Cost: The anticipated cost should be fair and reasonable to the government based upon comparative service pricing from past awarded agreements.

Results of Market Survey: Market research indicates that many companies are able to provide the service. However, water services are typically operated by one company or local government and responsible for a certain area.

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None. See Items 5 above.


Any Other Interested Sources? There are no other sources that have expressed an interest to date.

A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: It is not anticipated that any subsequent requirement will be needed by the Government.

I hereby certify that the above is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The evaluation of offers received in response to the solicitation will use a tiered or cascading order of precedence.   Tiered evaluation of offers,  also known as  cascading evaluation of offers,  is a procedure used in negotiated acquisitions when market research is inconclusive for justifying limiting competition to small business concerns or sub-categories of small business concerns.  

The Contract Officer 

(1) Solicits offers from both small and other than small business concerns that will be evaluated in the following tiered order:

  (a) service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB);
  (b) veteran-owned small business (VOSB);
  (c) all other small business concerns;
  (d) other than small business.

(2) If an award or a sufficient number of awards cannot be made at the first tier, evaluation of 
      offers will proceed at the next lower tier until an award or a sufficient number of awards can 
      be made.

This is a request for quotations (RFQ). The quote document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-94, 2005-95 / 01-19-2017.


The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339112, with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees.

B.4 SALIENT CHACTERISTICS FOR PRIMATE EYE TRACKING SYSTEM:

The MIRECC is congressionally mandated to study and develop cures for post-traumatic stress disorder and its co-occurring medical disorders to include traumatic brain injury (TBI). Post-concussion "vision syndrome" is a well-recognized after-effect of head injury and one not currently assessed by the MIRECC in its studies of TBI and or PTSD. Recent report validate eye tracking to be an important diagnostic and prognostic indicator of brain trauma characteristics and long-term outcomes. In keeping with this, the MIRECC has determined cranial nerves controlling eye movement are among the most easily and persistently injured central nervous tissues affected by blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury. Therefore, the VISN 20 MIRECC requires the capacity to document, surveil and investigate its expanded diagnostic and prognostic uses to help Veterans suffering from post-concussive traumatic brain injuries. The VISN 20 MIRECC does not currently have this capacity. This is a new addition / technology. The majority of TBI in the VA population has resulted from combat exposure to explosive ordinance detonation which produces a complex whole-body injury exposure. The MIRECC requires the ability to track the movement of eyes across a variety of research applications in rodents with and without blast-related TBI in order to study the effects of whole body injury exposures, with an emphasis on non-invasive correlates of injury severity such as eye tracking. 




To accomplish this the Government requires the following criteria to be met:

The system must be adaptable to rodents and have sufficient published peer-reviewed scientific journal articles to indicate the validity of the data collected and it general acceptance.

The system must use a IR illumination source to track the dark pupils of mice and prevent signal degradation caused by changes in pupil size.

The eye trackers operate at both video field rates and at high
speed, up to 1000 Hz.

The detection system and tracking must be compatible with contact lens (which are often required in experiments involving mouse eye tracking).

The system should be mainly controlled via keyboard in-put and provide real time  on screen  video feedback.

The system should be upgradable.

The system must be able to perform in high and low illumination environments.

    (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
    (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
  (u) Unauthorized Obligations.
    (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
      (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
      (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an  I agree  click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g.,  click-wrap  or  browse-wrap  agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
      (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
    (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor s representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.

Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Oct 2014)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1 Technical<br />Factor 2 Price</p>
<p>(b) Basis for Award &amp; Evaluation</p>
<p>This will be a Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procurement. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without discussions with offerors. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The LPTA process is selected as appropriate for this acquisition because the best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable quotation with the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>An overall technical rating must be at least "ACCEPTABLE" in order to be eligible for award. An "UNACCEPTABLE" rating, in any factor, results in the overall technical proposal being rated "UNACCEPTABLE." An overall technical rating of "UNACCEPTABLE" makes a quotation ineligible for award.</p>
<p>An offeror is expected to submit sufficient information in response to the RFQ to allow for the evaluation of its quotation. All quotations submitted with equivalent product shall be IAW 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal specified criteria and quotations shall provide a matrix that directly points back to all MEC's. It is the Contractors Responsibility to provide enough information to show how their "Or Equal" product meets the required MEC's and is comparable to the requested Brand.</p>
<p>Each of the evaluation factors will be rated as follows:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical <br />The degree to which the offeror's quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide the requested brand name items that meet the salient characteristics described in the SOW attachment and can meet the delivery schedule.</p>
<p>Table A-1. Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Price</p>
<p>The offeror's price quotes will be evaluated to determine the price is fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 12.209 and FAR 13.106-3.</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of provision)</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><br />52.246-17 WARRANTY OF SUPPLIES OF A NONCOMPLEX NATURE (JUN 2003)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause --</p>
<p>Acceptance means the act of an authorized representative of the Government by which the Government assumes for itself, or as an agent of another, ownership of existing supplies, or approves specific services as partial or complete performance of the contract.</p>
<p>Supplies means the end items furnished by the Contractor and related services required under this contract. The word does not include ``data.''</p>
<p>(b) Contractor's obligations.</p>
<p>(1) Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance by the Government of supplies furnished under this contract, or any condition of this contract concerning the conclusiveness thereof, the Contractor warrants that for 45 days --</p>
<p>(i) All supplies furnished under this contract will be free from defects in material or workmanship and will conform with all requirements of this contract; and</p>
<p>(ii) The preservation, packaging, packing, and marking, and the preparation for, and method of, shipment of such supplies will conform with the requirements of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) When return, correction, or replacement is required, transportation charges and responsibility for the supplies while in transit shall be borne by the Contractor. However, the Contractor's liability for the transportation charges shall not exceed an amount equal to the cost of transportation by the usual commercial method of shipment between the place of delivery specified in this contract and the Contractor's plant, and return.</p>
<p>(3) Any supplies or parts thereof, corrected or furnished in replacement under this clause, shall also be subject to the terms of this clause to the same extent as supplies initially delivered. The warranty, with respect to supplies or parts thereof, shall be equal in duration to that in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause and shall run from the date of delivery of the corrected or replaced supplies.</p>
<p>(4) All implied warranties of merchantability and "fitness for a particular purpose" are excluded from any obligation contained in this contract.</p>
<p>(c) Remedies available to the Government.</p>
<p>(1) The Contracting Officer shall give written notice to the Contractor of any breach of warranties in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause within 45 days after discovery of the defect.</p>
<p>(2) Within a reasonable time after the notice, the Contracting Officer may either--</p>
<p>(i) Require, by written notice, the prompt correction or replacement of any supplies or parts thereof (including preservation, packaging, packing, and marking) that do not conform with the requirements of this contract within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this clause; or</p>
<p>(ii) Retain such supplies and reduce the contract price by an amount equitable under the circumstances.</p>
<p>(3) (i) If the contract provides for inspection of supplies by sampling procedures, conformance of suppliers or components subject to warranty action shall be determined by the applicable sampling procedures in the contract. The Contracting Officer--</p>
<p>(A) May, for sampling purposes, group any supplies delivered under this contract;</p>
<p>(B) Shall require the size of the sample to be that required by sampling procedures specified in the contract for the quantity of supplies on which warranty action is proposed;</p>
<p>(C) May project warranty sampling results over supplies in the same shipment or other supplies contained in other shipments even though all of such supplies are not present at the point of reinspection; provided, that the supplies remaining are reasonably representative of the quantity on which warranty action is proposed; and</p>
<p>(D) Need not use the same lot size as on original inspection or reconstitute the original inspection lots.</p>
<p>(ii) Within a reasonable time after notice of any breach of the warranties specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Contracting Officer may exercise one or more of the following options:</p>
<p>(A) Require an equitable adjustment in the contract price for any group of supplies.</p>
<p>(B) Screen the supplies grouped for warranty action under this clause at the Contractor's expense and return all nonconforming supplies to the Contractor for correction or replacement.</p>
<p>(C) Require the Contractor to screen the supplies at locations designated by the Government within the contiguous United States and to correct or replace all nonconforming supplies.</p>
<p>(D) Return the supplies grouped for warranty action under this clause to the Contractor (irrespective of the f.o.b. point or the point of acceptance) for screening and correction or replacement.</p>
<p>(4) (i) The Contracting Officer may, by contract or otherwise, correct or replace the nonconforming supplies with similar supplies from another source and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned to the Government thereby if the Contractor--</p>
<p>(A) Fails to make redelivery of the corrected or replaced supplies within the time established for their return; or</p>
<p>(B) Fails either to accept return of the nonconforming supplies or fails to make progress after their return to correct or replace them so as to endanger performance of the delivery schedule, and in either of these circumstances does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure.</p>

<p><br />252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal <br />Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to <br />ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br /><br />(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br />Solicitation:</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Item No. Supplies/Service Quantity Unit Unit price Amount<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />0001............................ Computer, Desktop with 20 EA ............ ...........<br />CPU, Monitor, Keyboard<br />and Mouse.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Alternative line-item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Item No. Supplies/Service Quantity Unit Unit Price Amount<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />0001............................ Computer, Desktop with 20 EA ............ ...........<br />CPU, Keyboard and Mouse.<br />0002............................ Monitor................. 20 EA ............ ...........<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />(End of provision)</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract
awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a
prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some
external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file
a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG
procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable
Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested
parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under
this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of
an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or
other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following
information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting
Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,
protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer
through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent
Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either
the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award
or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in
writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in
less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth
in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the
protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed
within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program
should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand
delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the
Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not
to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external
forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695

<p><br />8. 25.101 BUY AMERICA ACT</p>
<p>(a) The Buy American Act restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products. For manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product.</p>
<p>(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and</p>
<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>
<p>52.249-1 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the Government's interest. If this contract is terminated, the rights, duties, and obligations of the parties, including compensation to the Contractor, shall be in accordance with Part 49 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to DANIEL.J.NIEVES@USCG.MIL Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of proposals.</p>
<p>INTERESTED VENDORS PLEASE SIGN 1449 ACCOMPANIED BY OFFICIAL QUOTE WITH A SAM.GOV REGISTERED DUNS NUMBER AND EMAIL TO DANIEL.J.NIEVES@USCG.MIL</p>

For those supplies or services requiring qualification, whether the covered product or service is an end item under this contract or simply a component of an end item, the product, manufacturer, or source must have demonstrated that it meets the standards prescribed for qualification before award of this contract. The product, manufacturer, or source must be qualified at the time of award whether or not the name of the product, manufacturer, or source is actually included on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list. Offerors should contact the agency activity designated below to obtain all requirements that they or their products or services, or their subcontractors or their products or services, must satisfy to become qualified and to arrange for an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification.</span></p>

This is necessary whether the Contractor or a subcontractor will ultimately provide the product or service in question. If, after award, the Contracting Officer discovers that an applicable qualification requirement was not in fact met at the time of award, the Contracting Officer may either terminate this contract for default or allow performance to continue if adequate consideration is offered and the action is determined to be otherwise in the Governments best interests.</span></p>

Similarly, any change in location or ownership of a previously qualified manufacturer or source requires reevaluation of the qualification. The reevaluation must be accomplished before the date of award.</span></p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>(End of instructions)</p>
<p>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS</p>
<p>Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions. <br />Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required: <br />1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement <br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request <br />3. Vehicle Access Request <br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided) <br />All forms are available for download on the MSC contracts webpage at http://www.msc.navy.mil.

Vendor will be notified by MSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated. <br /><br />RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com). <br /><br />Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form". <br /><br />Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms. <br /><br />Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation seeking Firm Fixed Price (FFP) quotes for commercial aircraft component repair/overhaul services prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) with estimated (AVERAGE) repair/overhaul cost quotes may be submitted for consideration. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government's historical pricing data. Solicitation number 70Z03818QW0000028 is issued as a notice of intent to award to a capable repair vendor. It is anticipated that a competitive Purchase Order shall be awarded as a result of this notice. It is the Governments belief, that only a previously established Capable Repair Vendor in possession of the required OEM Data has the required proprietary technical and engineering data to successfully provide these repair services. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these services are invited to submit complete information discussing the same within (3) calendar days from this notice posting. The information submitted must include a letter from the OEM verifying the Offeror is an authorized service distributor and verifying the OEM will supply only genuine OEM parts. Instructions to Offerors-Commercial and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-96.
<p>Any vendor, except the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or a Production Approval Holder (PAH), repairing Coast Guard Aircraft Components MUST be FAA 145 certified and perform at least fifty percent (50%) of the work at their company's FAA certified facility. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, awards for the repair or overhaul of Coast Guard Aircraft Repairable Components shall only be awarded directly to service vendors who have been deemed fully capable of performing such services by division level command-appointed Coast Guard Engineers or Equipment Specialists. Vendors who do not meet the above stated capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond to this solicitation/request for quote.</p>
<p>THIS IS AN UNRESTRICTED SOLICITATION. This solicitation will not be extended or the award delayed for a vendor to submit their service data for capability determination or for registration in SAM.GOV. If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS Engineering, vendors who believe they would otherwise qualify based on the aforementioned criteria are encouraged to contact Hans.C.Baer@uscg.mil for a capability evaluation and determination toward future awards consideration. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 488190. The Coast Guard intends to issue a Not-To-Exceed post assessment firm fixed price repair/overhaul order to the Aircraft Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), the Component Production Approval Holder (PAH), or a PAH Authorized and Capable Service Facility, for repair/overhaul of a C27J Aircraft Component(s) using OEM Proprietary Data for the following item(s):<br /><br />2 Each NSN 5826-01-HS2-9442, P/N 500000-820-01, COMM/NAV/RADIO PANL (Repair IAW OEM Specs)<br />1 Each NSN 6080-01-hs2-8610, P/N 500000-812, SINGLE AVIONICS MGM (Repair IAW OEM Specs)</p>
<p>J&amp;A with Basic Requirement Page and General Information Packet is attached to this solicitation. The Coast Guard does not own nor can provide the OEM's Service Manuals, Service Bulletins, or Proprietary Data. Unless the OEM or an Incumbent, with their quote, vendors must provide a copy of the first page of the current OEM Manual or Service Reference, and in their quote make reference to it (i.e. "will be repaired IAW CMM 12345-6789"). The Aircraft OEM is FINMECCANICA S.PA. (LEONARDO SPA) Cage Code A1512. Determined by the urgency of need, the closing date for this solicitation is November 27, 2017 at 9:00 am EDT. Anticipated award date is on or about November 28, 2017, with an anticipated required delivery date of all items on or before February 28, 2018. Point of contact for this intent to award notice is Mr. Terry Blucker PA/KO, email Terence.L.Blucker@uscg.mil.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

A potential six-month extension IAW the clause FAR 52.217-8 will be evaluated at the pricing of the final option year divided by two. In the event of an extension under this clause, it will be exercised at the prices of the prior contract year.</p>
<p>Technical: The technical approach will be evaluated to determine if it clearly demonstrates a complete and realistic plan to meet Service Summary items SS-1, SS-2, SS-3, SS-4, SS-5, SS-6, and SS-7 of the Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>Past Performance: Evaluation of past performance will consider past performance information obtained from any suitable source, such as Air Force automated past performance data bases (i.e. CPARS, PPIRS), direct local business experience with the quoter, or similar.</p>
<p>Site Visit: A site visit will be held on 7 November 2017 at 10:00 AM EST. We will start at the contracting office conference room and travel to washer and dryer locations as needed. If you wish to attend, fill out Attachment 4 - Base Pass Request and email it to the contracting POCs no later than 2:00 PM EST 3 November 2017</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Original Notice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request for Information (RFI)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Integrated Live, Virtual, Constructive<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Test Environment (ILTE)<br /></strong><br />1.0 Purpose<br />The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to obtain information and solicit industry comment in anticipation of a future competitive solicitation for the product development for the ILTE program.<br /><br />2.0 Introduction<br />The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets, and Threat Simulators and SOF Training Systems (PM ITTS) Instrumentation Management Office (IMO) is performing research to gather information and feedback from interested sources for a new contract supporting the current and future objectives of the Instrumentation Management Office. This support extends to its Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) customers, including - but not limited to - the US Army Operational Test Command (OTC), Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), the Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E).<br /><br />2.1 Program Description<br />PM ITTS IMO has a requirement to support the OTC's mission to provide congressionally-mandated operational testing of new and emerging systems. As operational testing is conducted at a variety of locations versus a single test site, ILTE must operate in a wide range of environments, from urban to austere. Test events normally last several weeks, with extended periods of operations up to 96 hours.</p>
<p>ILTE will pursue a two-path approach:<br /><br />1) Design, develop and provide an integrated suite of live-synthetic simulations capable of producing operational realism to provide an accurate battlefield test environment, capture, record and transmit all required test data, and provide a data reduction, analysis and visualization capability.</p>
<p>2) Design, develop and provide technical solutions to address gaps in current test/training technologies to support operational tests. Gap technologies may comprise one of two potential solutions: 1) a capability unique to a given test and not transitioned as a part of the objective suite of test tools or 2) a capability the tester may leverage to support a variety of tests and transitions as a part of the objective suite of test tools.</p>
<p>ILTE will enable PM ITTS IMO to employ a block approach to modernize the existing operational test/training technology suite. The block approach utilizes three primary thrust areas: 1) Analysis of Alternatives and Research and Development, 2) Prototyping, development and field testing, and 3) Systems/components integration to support Operational Tests. The blocks are not necessarily sequential in execution but will overlap throughout the period-of-performance.</p>
<p>ILTE is expected to provide PM ITTS IMO&lsquo;s customer base a suite of new capabilities that mitigates obsolescence, meets higher thresholds of technical performance, and improves test/training efficiencies. The spectrum of effort required is expected to range from Science &amp; Technology transition, requirements analysis and concept exploration to technology investigation and rapid prototyping, system development, system sustainment, system storage, system deployment and other related tasks.</p>
<p>The ILTE required functional capability areas respondents should address include:</p>
<p>1) Real Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) Effects: Includes the simulation, execution, and analysis of engagements that produce realistic outcomes based on the lethality and survivability characteristics between hostile, friendly, and ancillary forces within the operational environment. RTCA includes live and synthetic player units, their health and status, their position location information, and their interactions with other player units and the physical environment.</p>
<p>2) Integrating Architectures and Standards: Includes integrating architectures and standards common to test and training environments, common data models, and current and evolving architectures, protocols, and standards.</p>
<p>3) Synthetic Environments: Includes computer-based representations of the real world, including the natural environment and allows for the interaction among and between combinations of Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) player units. The synthetic environments may be created within a single computer or over a distributed network connected by local and wide area networks and augmented by realistic special effects and accurate behavioral models to provide visualization of and immersion into the environment being simulated.</p>
<p>4) Test Planning: Includes capabilities that optimize test trials and resource allocation in support of verification, validation, and accreditation (VV&amp;A) and operational testing.</p>
<p>5) Test Monitoring and Control: Includes test monitoring and control requirements that allow test team personnel to monitor and control the processes, systems, and player units in an operational test; especially technologies that ensure test factors are met and required data collected. In addition, this section covers requirements associated with alerts and automated reports to indicate test vignette and data collection status.</p>
<p>6) Cybersecurity: Includes design, implementation, and approval with DOD directives and Army regulations pertaining to cybersecurity, including Certificate of Networthiness, Authority to Operate, and Cross Domain Solutions (CDS).</p>
<p>7) Networks: Includes requirements for networks associated with supporting the transfer of data between required locations for the following activities: health and status monitoring, force-on-target networks (e.g.) pop-ups, buildings, etc.), situational awareness of test environment, and the force-on-force engagement interactions required between live and synthetic player units/ environments to produce the required RTCA effects.</p>
<p>8) Data Collection, Reduction, Analysis, and Visualization: Includes requirements associated with data collection, reduction, analysis, and visualization. This includes access, analysis, and visualization of collected test data.</p>
<p>9) Live Environment Compatibility and Risk Reduction: Includes the capabilities required to address live environment compatibility, risk reduction, and incorporation of lessons learned to enable effective application and enhancement of solutions in support of operational tests.</p>
<p>10) Test as a Service (TaaS): Includes the requirements to provide full support of on-site operational testing. Anticipated functions include test planning, integration of live-virtual-constructive technologies, design and development of hardware and software prototypes, production and development of test technologies, deployment of instrumentation to support on-site operational testing and provide logistical and maintenance support.</p>

Future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the Government to award all line items (RRC in-house beds and home confinement placements) to a single provider, as these services are interconnected and rely upon each other to ensure adequate programming and case management of offenders. The Government reserves the right to potentially make an award which is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>

<DESC>If viewing this announcement from a source other than Federal Aviation Administration's Contracting Opportunities (FAACO) website, please visit https://faaco.faa.gov/ for the original announcement.  Updates and/or amendments will only be issued on the FAACO website.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center is conducting a market survey to improve the Governmentâs understanding of the current marketplace and to identify capable sources for a potential air shuttle services requirement. Responses to this market survey will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB 8(a)'s), small businesses, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB's). This survey is being conducted in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1. 

The purpose of this market survey is to identify competent and qualified vendors to perform air shuttle service between the William J. Hughes Technical Center (ACY) and Reagan National Airport (DCA).  Vendors would be responsible to provide a primary airplane and a back-up airplane, for use when the primary plane is unavailable.    These requirements are subject to change after sufficient market research is performed and analyzed.

The current air shuttle contract provides a nineteen seat primary, and a nineteen seat back-up, and is contracted to perform through May of 2018. 

The NAICS code for this requirement is 48111 Scheduled Air Passenger Transportation. The size standard for this NAICS code is 1,500 employees, maximum. 

Interested parties: Email a capabilities statement and your businessâs DUNS number (to verify business size). Provide any other applicable documentation, such as SEDB 8(a) certification letter or your SDVOSB status with your submission, if applicable. Email to Lori.McLaughlin@faa.gov.

This survey will support market research obtained from multiple sources and will be utilized for planning purposes only, and no guarantee for a future contract may be inferred.  Further, vendor participation in any informational sessions is not a promise of future business with the FAA.  Any costs associated with responding to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the vendor, and will not be reimbursed by the FAA.

<p>Draft Statement of Work<br />Range 1-6 Auger Renovation</p>
<p><br />Existing Ranges 1-6 (Buildings 157, 159, 161, 163, 165 and 167) located on the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers, Glynco, GA have an existing vacuum system for removing expended ammunition and items discharged during the use of various firearms. The new system is an electric motor driven auger that will physically move the expended ammunition and other items that are expended when discharging firearms. The old trap for the vacuum system will be removed from the back of the existing steel plates. The current vacuum system will be removed and all equipment associated with it. The new auger system will be attached to the existing steel plates and the drive motor will be installed per design in a new attached structure on one side of each existing Range.</p>
<p>No abatement or remediation is required as part of this work. This is a Lead-Free range. The Government will provide both air sample tests and swipe tests results. The contractor is responsible for testing the air where work is taking place at the time of the work to ensure proper protection is provided for all workers.</p>
<p>The equipment to be removed will be cleaned with a HEPA vacuum. The equipment will be tested to ensure the residue remaining is within safe limits defined by the EPA, OSHA, and other applicable state and national standards. The removed equipment will be turned over to the Government. The equipment will be deposited in Government provided bins and disposed of by the Government.</p>
<p>The Government will clean the ammunition debris collection systems before the start of work and dispose of contents. The Government will provide 55 gallon barrels for the purpose of collecting debris and dust that is a result of the work. Once the contractor has placed the material in the barrels and filled them, the Government will dispose of the barrels and material.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The RPB Radio Programs are congressionally mandated (Diplomatic Security &amp; Anti-terrorism Act of 1986) and consist of four programs: Domestic Radio Operations (DRO), Washington Area Radio Network (WARN), High Frequency (HF) and Overseas Emergency &amp; Evacuation (E&amp;E).</p>
<p>IRM's Overseas Radio Program provides radio communication capability to Department of State direct-hire American employees at United States missions abroad by maintaining E&amp;E radio networks. As radio networks age and become obsolete, RPB replaces them and provides repair and return services.</p>
<p>The Global Repair and Replacement Program (GRRP) is a 10-year, life cycle replacement program for the E&amp;E radio program at overseas posts. The GRRP replaces all E&amp;E subscriber radios (handhelds, mobiles, base stations) and repeater systems used to provide the E&amp;E radio service. With 280 total posts around the world, RPB performs either replacements or updates at a rate of approximately 28 posts a year.</p>
<p>The E&amp;E radio program is made up of two channels: the E&amp;E channel, which is unencrypted, and the Emergency Action Committee (EAC) channel, which is encrypted. RPB provides all DOS personnel a radio with the E&amp;E channel. If a person is on the EAC at post, he/she will get an encryption capable radio with the additional EAC channel. As part of the E&amp;E radio program, RPB also provides post with a base station radio in the three strategic post locations.</p>

The purpose of this amendment is to provide vendor questions and the Government s response, to update the RFI attachment, and to extend the due date for responses to the RFI from November 24th, to November 28th.

Question:
 There is a reference to a pilot project in the PIO group. See paragraph below. Can you share who is performing this work now?
In order to effectively achieve this, individual programs officials retain the responsibility to identify and prevent FWA, while PIO will work to provide the tools for success. For example, in FY 18, PIO is working on a pilot program that includes an independent assessment of the risk for fraud, waste, and abuse in each of VA s 85 programs and an automated tool to assist in the future risk assessments. 
Response:
 VA has partnered with Department of Treasury s Financial Innovation Transformation office on a pilot program for setting up an optimal program integrity office and performing some projects such as new methods for VA programs to identify FWA risk. Department of Treasury will translate the results to a playbook that can be used in other Government agencies.  The work is currently ongoing and involves contractor support from Department of Treasury.

<DESC>The abuse of, and dependence on, a variety of substances remains a significant public health concern. Currently no approved pharmacotherapies exist to treat individuals dependent on cocaine, methamphetamine, or Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Thus, the preclinical evaluation of potential pharmacotherapies for substance abuse is a critical component in NIDA's effort at addressing this public health problem.
<p>One of the best-established approaches for identifying and developing a potential treatment for drug abuse is to evaluate the compound for its pharmacological activities alone and its ability to alter the effects of the abused drug. Such an approach allows one to understand the potential utility of a compound, allowing rational selection of lead candidate compounds that warrant further testing and development, from among a wide variety of drugs. This approach has been employed routinely and successfully by the pharmaceutical industry as a means of identifying and evaluating compounds for potential therapeutic utility in treating other diseases, including central nervous system indications. The NIDA/Division of Pharmacotherapies and Medical Consequences of Drug Abuse (DPMCDA)/Addiction Treatment Discovery Program (ATDP) utilizes preclinical (animal) models to predict clinical efficacy of test compounds. The in vivo assays include mouse locomotor activity, rat drug discrimination, rat standard conditioned place preference, mouse stress-induced potentiation of conditioned place preference, and rat self-administration (all to be supported by this contract), rat relapse model, and primate drug discrimination and self-administration.</p>

This is an increase to the current contract for the purchase of additional E-ZPass transponders. The original action was a firm-fixed price, sole source contract with Faneuil, Inc., on behalf of the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) solicited only to the one responsible source for providing E-ZPass service. No other vendor can fulfill this requirement.
