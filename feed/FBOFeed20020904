<DESC>DESC:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation # RFQ 546-74-02 is issued as a Request for Quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAR 97-27. =20 Item #1:  Contractor shall provide all labor, tools, equipment, materials and supervision to furnish and install a new incinerator monitoring system which will satisfy the new EPA requirements and other items as noted in the =93Requirements=94 section of this document, for the operation of our existing Hospital/Medical/Infectious Waste Incinerator.  The new EPA regulations will become effective September  2002.  The Medical Center has to install a new monitoring system to meet the new regulations.=20 Requirements:  Contractor will furnish and install a complete monitoring data logger system to include the following:  The proposed monitoring system will include a data logger, integrated weight scale with credit offered should our scale be usable, one (1) personal computer with CD-ROM burner and printer installed in the plant supervisors office and one (1) monitor installed in the incinerator plant operators station.  The system must be compatible and share data with both the Incinerator PLC and the Scrubber PLC and structure it according to the current EPA regulations.  The software will be compatible with Windows NT 4.0 and local network.  The system will be required to gather and compare the data in a 3-hour rolling average against permitted conditions to demonstrate compliance.  Also guarantee that the system will not be able to generate non-compliance data from the incinerator for EPA enforcement use.  Additionally the program should lock out the ability to charge waste if the incinerator is non-compliant in any of the parameters exceeding the allowable limit of any 3-hour average by 50%.  We require a text notification and functional operator bypass on the PC screen that will allow the operator to continue to load waste if it is activated.  This will assume the issue that caused the 3-hour average to exceed 50% has been, or is in the process of being corrected, If the 3-hour average continues to exceed EPA regulations up to 80% of the average 3-hour window, it will automatically lock out the incinerator until the situation has been corrected.  This is to guarantee that we will not record data into the violation report section.  We required automatic calibration checks on a regularly scheduled basis, continuous emission monitors, and flow monitors,  (Flow monitors, require this check each day).  The new system will measure and record nine (9) parameters at a frequency that will comply with the new EPA regulations.  The nine (9) parameters are as follows:  1.  Minimum temperature of secondary chamber  2.  Date, time and maximum weigh of each charge fed into the HMIWI  3.  Maximum, temperature of flu gas (treated exhaust gas from scrubber stack)  4.  Minimum amperage to wet scrubber (rotary atomizer amps) 5.  Minimum scrubber liquid flow rate 6.  Minimum scrubber liquid pH.  7.  Measuring use of the bypass stack including date, time, and duration.  8.  Maximum CO levels  9.  Maximum O2 level, normalized to 7%. The new monitoring system will have the capability of monitoring data at all times during HMIWI operation except during periods of monitoring equipment malfunction, calibration, or repair.  At a minimum, according to the regulations, valid monitoring data will be obtained for 75% of the operating hours per day and 90% of the operating day per calendar quarter that the Medical Center is combusting hospital waste, and or medical/infectious waste.  Since the regulations require valid monitoring data 75% of the operating hours per day and 90% of the operating days per calendar quarter, a separate front end system is required to be installed with the new monitoring system in addition to the existing PLC. The system will have the capability to include new points added without the addition of new hardware.  Also to have the software capability to organized and form reports to the EPA for both quarterly and annual reports.  We request three (3) repair/operation manuals, list of equipment, QA/QC and certification plan and provide training to the incinerator operators.=20 The system must be turnkey with a guarantee to meet DERM Regulations and EPA regulations under Title 5. Delivery Date:   Equipment must be installed and operational no later than September =96 2002.  Provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition with the following addenda:  Offerors shall include the following information when submitting a quote under this solicitation:(1) Manufacturer=92s specification sheet for item or items offered  (2) Description of warranties available with each item offered (3) References:  Past customers who have had a system same/similar to this installed at their facility.  Offerors should also include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items with their offer.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Easy5 Software. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Mechanical Devices, Inc., pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Competition is impractical because: (a) Easy5 software is required for compatibility between Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and other NASA Centers and aerospace contractors.  Easy5 has become the industry standard modeling tool for spacecraft reaction control propulsion systems and vehicle main propulsion systems, and MSFC must acquire this software to be able to run, evaluate, or modify system models developed by Johnson Space Center (JSC) or by Boeing.  MSFC=92s increased role in distributed propulsion feed system design (such as X-37, SLI on-orbit propulsion systems, and the SLI Boeing cross feed system) has made it imperative that MSFC acquire this analytical tool to maintain its ability to evaluate candidate designs.	MSFC has evaluated alternate modeling tools and found that Easy5 has exceptional ease of use, extensibility, and built-in libraries that exceed the capabilities of other tools currently in use at MSFC and in the aerospace industry.  (b) Mechanical Dynamics, Inc. is the only legitimate source for Easy5 software. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on September 20, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NA Safe Drinking Water Act Compliance Program For Fort Bliss, Texas Cross Connection Control Survey And Testing C.1.0	General Information C.1.1	Organization and Mission C.1.2	Background and Objectives C.1.2.1	 Background.  The SDWA requires that each Federal activity with jurisdiction over a public water system comply with applicable Federal, State, and Local requirements. The SDWA and requirements specified in the National Primary and Secondary Drinkin g Water Regulations (40 CFR 141 and 143, respectively) are designed to ensure that each and every user of a public water system is provided with water, which is safe to consume. One technique for helping ensure compliance with these standards is to develop  and implement a Backflow Protection and Cross-Connection Control (BPCCC) Program. The Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (TNRCC) and the New Mexico Environmental Department (NMED) is responsible for implementing the standards of Public Law 93 -523 -- Federal Safe Drinking Water Act and Amendments of 1986 in Texas and New Mexico, respectively.  In doing so, both Regulatory Agencies requires public water suppliers to prohibit connections to establishments where an actual or potential contaminatio n or system hazard exists unless approved backflow prevention assemblies protect the public water supply. The public water supplier also is required to establish a program whereby the backflow prevention assemblies are tested upon installation and at least  annually.  Fort Bliss, in its role as a public water supplier, has established and will provide the maintenance for the BPCCC Program. This program protects the public water supply from contamination or pollution due to cross connections through a combina tion of premises and in-plant isolation. The BPCCC Program is reviewed annually by the TNRCC and NMED during annual water compliance inspections at Fort Bliss. C. 1.2.2 Backflow Prevention Assemblies vs. Backflow Prevention Devices For clarity, the term Backflow Prevention (BFP) Assembly refers to a backflow Preventor that includes an inlet and outlet shut-off valve and the required number of test cocks to facilitate testing of the assembly.  Mechanical units designed to stop the rev ersal of flow, but which are not BFP assemblies are referred to as devices.  A BFP device does not have inlet and outlet shut-off valves or test cocks to facilitate testing.  A BFP device cannot be tested and provides no means by which to verify its condit ion. C. 1.2.3  Objectives.   The goal of the BPCCC is to ensure safe drinking water under all foreseeable circumstances.  A BPCCC Program is a continuing effort to locate and correct all existing or potential cross-connection hazards and to discourage their creation.  Annual maintenan ce and testing of the assemblies is another requirement to maintain an effective program.  Fort Bliss BPCCC Program is supported by three distinct program components:  1. Cross Connection Control (CCC) Survey 2. Installation of new BFP assemblies and replace/relocate/removal of existing assemblies. 3. Testing of new and existing assemblies and maintenance or repair of existing assemblies.   The following SOW addresses the CCC Survey and Testing program components. C.2.0  Definitions Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly An assembly that has been manufactured in full compliance with the American Water Works Association standards C510 and C511 and appears on the most current List of Approved Backflow Prevention Assemblies, published by the Foundation for Cross-Connection Co ntrol and Hydraulic Research (Foundation) at the University of Southern California. Auxiliary Water System Any water supply on or available to the premises other than the Ft. Bliss water distribution system.  These auxiliary waters are not under the sanita ry control of Ft. Bliss and may include water from another public water supplier, wells, used or reclaimed water, or industrial fluids.  Backflow  The unintended or undesirable reversal of the normal water flow caused by either backsiphonage or backpressure.  Backflow Prevention Methods, Devices, and Assemblies  The types of backflow prevention methods, devices, and assemblies shall be based on the existing or potential degree of  hazard, and backflow condition.  The definitions for each type of backflow prevention method, device, or assembly listed below are contained in subsequent sections of this manual.  The types are as follows: Air gap	Method Atmospheric vacuum breaker Device Double check valve 	Assembly Pressure vacuum breaker 	Assembly Reduced pressure principle 	Assembly Spill-resistant pressure vacuum breaker 	Assembly The definitions for each type of backflow prevention method, device, or assembly listed above are contained in subsequent sections of this manual Backflow Prevention Specialist  A person deemed knowledgeable and competent in the conducting surveys, to asse ss the degree of hazard, and determine the appropriate protection needed as determined by successful completion of a training course approved by the Foundation, and has obtained certification as a CCC Specialist, or equivalent course as approved by the Cro ss-Connection Control Program Manager.  Backflow Prevention (BFP) Assembly Tester  A person deemed knowledgeable and competent in the installation, testing, maintenance, and repair of backflow prevention assemblies as determined by successful completion of  a training course on cross-connection control and backflow prevention approved by the TNRCC and NMED, passed an examination administered by the TNRCC or its designated agent and hold current professional certification as a backflow prevention assembly tes ter.  The accredited tester classification shall be broken down into two categories:    1. The General Tester is qualified to test and repair backflow prevention assemblies on any domestic, commercial, industrial or irrigation service (except Firelines.) 2.	The Fireline Tester is qualified to test and repair backflow prevention assemblies on firelines only.  The State Fire Marshalls office requires that a person performing maintenance on firelines must be employed by an Approved Fireline Contractor. Backp ressure  A form of backflow due to an increase of system pressure that is greater than supply pressure.  Backsiphonage  A form of backflow due to negative or decreased pressure in the water supply system.  Containment Cross-Connection Control Provides protection of the water distribution system from the backflow of contaminants.  This is accomplished by the installation of an air gap or an approved backflow prevention assembly at the water service connection.  Containment cross-connection contr ol does not provide protection to the occupants of the premises, but shall be considered as additional backflow protection and shall not negate the use of backflow prevention on internal hazards within a premises potable water system.   Contamination  The presence of any foreign substance (organic, inorganic, radiological, or biological) in water that tends to degrade its quality to constitute a health hazard or impair the usefulness of the potable water system. Continuous Pressure  A point in the potable water system that may be subjected to operating pressure for more than twelve hours in  a twenty-four hour period. Cross Connection  A point in the potable water system that is connected directly, or has the potential of being connected, to a source of non-potable substance through which contaminants may enter the potable water system under any condition. Cross Connection Controlled  A cross connection with an approved backflow prevention method, device, or assembly properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford protection commensurate with the degree of hazard. Cross-Connection Control Program Manager The person designated by the Directorate of Environment to administer the Cross-Connection Control Program. Ft. Bliss A publicly owned wate r and sewer agency located in and serving the people of Ft. Bliss. Health Hazard  An actual or potential threat of contamination if introduced into the potable water system that may cause death, injury, illness or spread of disease. Isolation Cross-Connection Control Provides protection to the occupants of a premises by the installation of approved backflow prevention methods, devices, or assemblies at each cross connection within the premises potable water system. Non-Health Hazard  An actual or potential threat of pollution if introduced into the potable water system that would constitute a nuisance, inconvenience, or be aesthetically objectionable. Pollution  The presence of any foreign substance in the potable wa ter system that tends to degrade its quality but not constitute a health hazard or impair the usefulness of the water.  Premises Potable Water System Those parts of the premises or other areas beyond the water service connections that are utilized in conveying potable water to points of use.  System Hazard An actual or imminent threat of contamination to the water distribution system presenting a danger to public health.  Water Distribution System The network of conduits used for the delivery of potable water from the source to the water service connection. Water Service Connection  The point of connection to the water distribution system carrying potable water to the building, other points of use, or distribution on the property.

<DESC>NA It is the intent of the Government to award a sole source modification to Raytheon System Corporation for the following in support of the Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) Project Office:  The PEO for Air and Mi ssile Defense plans to conduct a low cost proof of concept for application of a COTS based NDI JLENS application of a fire control and surveillance system capable of providing an Air Directed Surface to Air Missile defense (ADSAM) capability in support of Surface Launched Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (SLAMRAAM) weapon system.  This acquisition will be procured as a follow-on requirement from Raytheon System Company, Bedford, MA, under the existing JLENS prime contract DASG60-98-C-0001. Technical  synergy and leveraging with other JLENS spirals, including weapon system interoperability, is necessary and can only be provided by the existing JLENS contractor, Raytheon System Corporation. The proposed effort is highly integral to JLENS spiral developm ent plan requiring application of prior development of software and hardware designs and development in a manner which assures compatibility with JLENS requirements and proves a pathway to later spiral development.  The effort requires detailed understandi ng of the current processing station software so that the fidelity of legacy JLENS interoperability in the proposed system and the next spiral is maintained. The Identification of the Friend and Foe system must be compatible with spiral development.  Addit ionally, modification of software and hardware for target detection and tracking must be adaptable to the spiral program.  It has been determined that award to any other source would result in duplication of cost in both the current program and the next sp iral which is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The material acquired will provide a capability to employ the SLAMRAAM weapon system against low altitude cruise missiles (LACM) and will provide a means of developing tactics, techniques and  procedures for conducting cruise missile defense operations and for providing and disseminating target location data for use in development of a single integrated air picture (SIAP).  The period of performance for the development, integration, and testing  will be 15 Oct 02 to 30 Sep 04.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  All responses must be in writing.  See Note 22.

The General Services Administration (GSA, Region 9, San Francisco) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Public Architecture and is seeking an Architect-Engineering (A-E) design team to design a new Border Patrol Station in the vicinity of Chula Vista/San Diego (Otay Mesa) California. The new facility will be comprised of several structures, totaling approximately 73,000 gross square feet (6,862 GSM) on a nearly 20 acre commercial site.  The structures will include a 57,100 sf Station Building, a 15,000 sf Vehicle Repair/Electronics Facility, 1000 sf dog kennel, 3,500 sf enclosed parking/vehicle storage, as well as washing and fueling facilities for vehicles.  Additionally, the site must be designed to accommodate approximately 750 parking spaces.  The estimated total cost for construction is $10,000,000 to $15,000,000.  The scope of A-E Services for this Firm Fixed-Price Contract may include but is not limited to the following: pre-design programming; site investigation (including geo-technical surveys and analyses, topographical and boundary surveys), design concepts, complete architectural and engineering design services, preparation of specifications and CADD drawings for construction documents, cost estimating, space planning, exterior and landscape design, comprehensive interior design, value engineering, post construction phase services, and other related supplemental services if so requested by the Government.  The project will be delivered either through Design-Build or the traditional Design-Bid-Build process.  Base services will likely include associated design efforts up through Bridging Documents (approximately 50% Construction Documents).  Dependant upon the final procurement strategy selected, the Government may exercise the option for the A/E to proceed with 100% Construction Documents, as well as assist in the bidding and construction phases.

The A-E selection will be completed in two stages as follows:  

STAGE I:  This phase will establish the Design Excellence capabilities of the A-E design firm and its lead designer. The ?lead designer? is the individual of design studio who will have the primary responsibility to conceive the design concept and the building?s architecture. This individual or studio is employed by the ?A-E design firm?, that is, the A-E firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, which will have contractual responsibility for the project design. In the first stage, a short list of a minimum of three (3) Architect-Engineer firms will be selected based upon the firms' submittals in response to this Request for Qualifications (RFQ).  Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the evaluation criteria listed below.  In addition, the A-E design firm shall submit a firm profile that is no longer than two (2) typewritten pages that describes the overall history of the firm, general design philosophy to projects, and the firm?s organizational make-up that supports the design process.  The A-E firm shall also submit a typewritten description (maximum two pages) and relevant 8-1/2? x 11? graphics (maximum three per project) of up to five (5) comparable building design projects completed within the last ten years. The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project and discuss how the clients? design, economic, and operational objectives were satisfied by the design.  The following items will serve as EVALUATION CRITERIA in order of importance:

(1) PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN:  The A-E design firm shall submit a portfolio of up to five outstanding projects completed by the firm within the past ten years.  Include a maximum of two typewritten pages per project describing design objectives, approach, results, project significance, key features, and awards and up to three illustrations (no larger than 8-inches by 10-inches each) for each project to indicate visual evidence of design quality. 
(2) PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT: The A-E design firm shall submit a statement of intent, written by the lead designer in a maximum of two (2) typewritten pages, indicating overall design philosophy, understanding of design issues, and approaches and solutions applicable to this project. 
(3) LEAD DESIGNER(S) PORTFOLIO(S):  Submit a description of two (2) designs completed within the past 10 years by each lead designer (maximum of one page per project).  Narratives shall include a discussion of the design challenges and solutions.  A maximum of three (3) illustrations no larger than 8-by-10 inches for each project can be included.
(4) LEAD DESIGNER(S) PROFILE(S):  Submit biographical sketch(es) including education, professional experience, and recognition of design efforts inclusive of examples for the lead designer(s) and other key individuals, including the design principal, project designer and project manager. Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to this project. 

The primary goal of this project is to develop an award-winning design that meets the project programming and budget parameters of the client agency.  In addition, appropriate and cost-effective integration of sustainable design principles will be required.  Formal LEED certification (as outlined by the U.S. Green Building Council) may be pursued, dependent upon the project budget.  Nonetheless, LEED 2.0 criteria will still be used as one of the tools in developing a successful design solution for this project.  Therefore, in addition to aesthetic design excellence; the demonstration of successful integration of sustainable practices will also be evaluated.

STAGE II: In this stage, the entire project team, including each A-E design firm selected in Stage I, its designated lead designer, and all the consultants who will work on the project will be interviewed and evaluated. The short listed A-E design firms will submit Standard Forms 254 and 255 for the entire project team for the final selection process.  Sufficient time will be provided for the A-E design firms to establish project teams. In developing the project team required for Stage II, A-E firms are advised that a majority development of contract effort must be performed within the area of geographical limitation defined as the State of California.  If the A-E design firm is comprised of a partnership, corporation, joint venture or other legal entity permitted by law to practice architecture or engineering, a complete description of the proposed internal responsibilities of the components must be included in the Stage I and II submittals.  This entity must be in place at the time of contract award.  Although this procurement is open to large businesses, small and minority A-E firms are encouraged to participate.  The Government recognizes the talent existing in smaller firms and encourages the contributions of new and innovative designers to public architecture.  Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Businesses are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses. All interested contractors are reminded that the successful contractor will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with small and disadvantaged firms as part of their original submitted teams.  Before award of the contract the A-E (if not a small business having an average gross receipts of less than $4M during each of the past three fiscal years) is required to submit an acceptable Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507.  Offerors are invited to attend a pre-submittal conference to discuss project requirements and the selection process.  The conference will be held at the Federal Building at 880 Front Street, Suite 4236, in San Diego, CA on August 6, 2002 at 10:00 AM.  Offerors are requested to notify the Contracting Officer, Lilia West by calling (415) 522-3152 or via e-mail to lilia.west@gsa.gov of the names of attendees.

<DESC>USAID will post a request for proposals (RFP) for indefinite quantity contracts (IQCs) with time and materials (T&M) pricing for technical assistance in the area of International Rule of Law and Justice Sector Technical Assistance. USAID estimates awarding approximately 4 contracts, including three unrestricted and one set-aside for small business, on the condition that it is capable of undertaking the work. USAID anticipates that the maximum ordering limitation of the contracts resulting from this RFP will be $100,000,000 over the 5 year ordering period. Note that this ceiling applies across all contracts and cannot be exceeded in the aggregate; each successful contractor will be eligible to compete on all task orders until the shared ceiling for all contracts is reached. Note that there is no guarantee on the number of contracts awarded or the number of orders that any one firm will receive beyond the minimum stated in the RFP. The RFP will be posted only at www.fedbizops.gov. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic media only. Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. Proposals are expected to be due on August 15, 2002. The purpose of these IQCs are to support developing counties' transition to, and consolidation of democratic governance through the rule of law, and the promotion and protection of human rights. Activities under this Subject Area will improve and enhance the Agency's performance in responding to challenges to the growth establishment and sustainability of legal and judicial systems which promote a rule of law consistent with respect for human rights and market based economies, commitment to legal equality, and democratic principles. In many developing countries with weak or nascent democratic traditions and underdeveloped economies, the processes and institutions which are necessary to uphold the rule of law are incompletely evolved, ineffective, or may not even exist. Their legal frameworks are often out of touch with social reality and contemporary needs, as well as diverging significantly from internationally accepted norms. Customary and informal practice may cause further deviations. When these conditions prevail, neither the rule of law, democratic reform nor sustainable economic development can be achieved. Activities under this Subject Area will fall within the following functional areas: (a) improving legal frameworks; (b) strengthening justice sector institutions; (c) increasing access to justice; and (d) building constituencies for justice sectoral reform. (e) improving host country human rights practices. (f) justice sector approaches to conflict mitigation and prevention (g) post-conflict transitions to rule of law.

<DESC>Cancer Information Products and Systems (CIPS) is responsible for developing, maintaining, and refining information on cancer treatment, screening, prevention, genetics, and supportive care for patients, health professionals, and the public, using editorial boards and scientific review processes.  To accomplish this goal, CIPS produces and distributes two databases, Physician Data Query (PDQ),a peer-reviewed cancer information database, and CANCERLIT, a comprehensive database of more than 1.5 million cancer-related citations and abstracts.  PDQ contains three types of information: 1) peer-reviewed, full-text summaries that reflect current information on all aspects of cancer care (including treatment, supportive care, screening, prevention, diagnosis, genetics, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) ), fully referenced with hyperlinks (CAM references not hyperlinked)to the supporting abstracts; 2) abstracts of more than 1,800 cancer clinical trials open to patient accrual and abstracts of more than 11,000 closed or completed cancer clinical trials, many linked to citations or abstracts of the resulting publications; and 3) directories of physicians and organizations involved in cancer care including cancer genetics professionals.  PDQ information is currently maintained at the CIPS Computer Center utilizing a relational database maintenance system and word processing software.  The system utilizes a XML-based authoring system.  The authoring interface will use a customized version of SoftQuad X-Metal along with browser functions and Microsoft Word.

The Cancer Information Products and Systems (CIPS) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) proposes to award a contract for content development and maintenance services for the CIPS electronic information products.   These products include the PDQ (Physician Data Query) database, CancerFax, and Cancer.gov.  The services to be provided are data collection, data analysis, abstracting, writing, indexing, keying, proofing, tracking, reporting, distribution, and marking documents using XML. 

The specific requirements for the procurement include developing, maintaining, and updating more than 200 cancer information summaries for health professionals and patients.  To accomplish this task requires the maintenance and operation of 5-7 editorial boards consisting of more than 100 medical doctors and other health professionals throughout the United States.   This procurement will require the contractor to develop the summaries using a XML-based authoring system and X-metal.  This effort will also provide translation of  the summaries into Spanish.  This effort will require the contractor to develop predefined or ad hoc literature searches of PubMed or other bibliographic databases and enter search results and other citations supplied by CIPS into a database (Reference Manager or similar database).   

This procurement will require a contractor to collect, analyze, index, and abstract more than 60 cancer protocols per month.  This task requires an intense knowledge of clinical trials, medical terminology, and indexing.   The contractor will be required to provide monitoring of the P.Q. database, precise tracking of more than 200 protocol amendments per month, ongoing assessment of the search and retrieval terms, adequate measures to ensure timely submission of protocols, and incorporation of protocol amendments.  This procurement requires constant tracking of protocol development in the Pharmaceutical Industry and among the hundreds of cancer centers and other research institutions throughout the United States and internationally.  

The contractor for this procurement will be required to maintain and update the P.Q. Directories of Physicians and Organizations.   This requires the use of a comprehensive system to collect information on more than 22,000 physicians per year and more than 3,000 cancer organizations.   The directories are directly related to the P.Q. clinical trial?s system and this procurement will require the development of very precise and accurate procedures to ensure the two systems are able to ?communicate? with each other.   

If the options are exercised, the contractor will be required to provide maintenance and enhancement to the CIPS Citations Management Database.  The contractor will work closely with CIPS Information Management Branch to develop and implement an electronic system to update PDQ information.  The contractor will provide extensive review and update to the PDQ Directories and eventually develop the proper interface for searching the PDQ Directories  online.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Cancer Prevention Studies Branch (CPSB), plans to enter into a sole source contract with BioServe Biotechnologies, LTD, 1050 West Street, Laurel, MD 20707.  The CCR requires the extraction of high molecular weight DNA from human lymphocyte specimens collected in the Polyp prevention Trial (PPT).  The ultimate purpose of this research project is to obtain high molecular weight DNA from lymphocytes that are suitable for subsequent analyses and to test the quality of the DNA already extracted from samples.  The DNA will be used in future analyses by NCI investigators to investigate the role of different genetic polymorphisms on adenomatous polyp recurrence and diet gene interactions.  BioServe Biotechnology is currently in the process of isolating DNA from lymphocytes of 500 polyp prevention trial participants and preparing these and other PPT DNA samples for analysis by custom high-throughput mass-spectrometry based Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight genotyping services for PPT under a separate contract.  BioServe Biotechnolgy has previously provided custom high-throughput mass-spectrometry based Matrix Assisted laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight gentoyping services for the PPT.  Mass-spectrometry genotyping has provided extremely accurate and reproducible results, with 100% concordance rates in all blinded control samples analyzed. Previously Bioserve performed XRCCi, APE, MTHFR and GSTml assays for the Cancer Prevention Studies Branch(under a separate contract).  The CCR has a strong programmatic need to continue the work with Bioserve to maintain the essential scientific comparability of the data especially for samples from the same clinical trial.  Bioserve is capable of genotyping 10,000 smaples in 24 hours with almost 100% reproducibility rate, as well as genotype assay with as little as 1-3 nano-grams of genomic DNA.  The introduce another compnay would be detrimental to the enormous amount of work already performed.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation, however, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EDT on September 19, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This requirement will be procured as a non-commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 13.  Please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent 9301) 402-4509 if you have further questions.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responese to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collects calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code is: 541380 and the business size standard is $6.0 million.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Statistics Branch (CSB), Division of Cancer Control and Population Studies (DCCPS) plans to procure the services of the University of Virginia School of Medicine, P.O. Box 400195, Charlottesville, VA 22904 for Creation of Colorectal Cancer Tissue Microarrays.  The supplies and services are being procured in accordance with simplified procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  NCI is leading a project of population-based tissue collection that enhances the relevance of laboratory results to public health concerns by overcoming the limitations associated with convenience samples, facility-based tissue collection, or cohort tissue collection.  By assembling many hundreds of specimens on a single block, tissue micro array (TMA) technology offers the promise of high-throughput assays for biomedical and epidemiological research.  TMA shows particular promise for the population-based cancer sciences; however, no arrays have yet been built from tissues representative of human populations. During November 30, 2001 through December 12, 2001, a pathologist team from the University of Virginia (UVA), performed the pathology preparatory work for colorectal cancer pathology materials at the Hawaii Tumor Registry. This contract is to construct the TMA blocks from those selected colon tissues.  This project involves a total of 363 invasive colorectal cases to be arrayed.  Of the 363 cases, 273 cases have been sent from Hawaii Cancer Registry to the UVA TMA facility for processing; 90 cases from Kuakini Hospital will be processed in Hawaii because theses cases are not permitted to be sent to UVA   Of the 273 non-Kuakini cases, 258 have both malignant and normal components available, whereas 15 cases without normal components. Period of Performance: Upon award of purchase order through 7 months.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (November 1999) applies to this requirement.  The University of Virginia School of Medicine is the only source known to the NCI that can provide a TMA Production facility at to continue the services under a cooperative agreement with DCTD/NCI.  In addition, UVA has performed the pathology preparatory work for colorectal cancer pathology materials to be arrayed at the Hawaii Tumor Registry; and having the UVA to construct the TMA by the same team who had worked on preparatory tissue samples will assure continuity in workflow unobtainable by the selection of any other sources.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington D.C. time) on September 11, 2002.   If you have questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail  holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  Cancer Prevention Studies Branch, CPSB requires services to sequence the BRCA2 gene in the blood of 50 ESCC cases as part of our efforts to determine the frequency of germline BRCA2 mutations in ESCC patients and compare the frequency of these mutations between ESCC cases with and without a family history of upper gastrointestinal cancer.  Previously we have shown that BRCA2 mutations occur with low to moderate frequency in ESCC tumors themselves and, through previous testing at Myriad Genetics, have identified several germline alterations (including both polymorphisms and mutations) in ESCC cases and their family members.  Myriad Genetics holds a patent on the BRCA2 genetic sequence and the commercial testing of this sequence in blood samples.  Period of Performance:  upon award of purchase order through 12 months, FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (November 1999) applies to this requirement. Myraid Genetics is the only source known to the NCI that holds a patent on the BRCA2 sequence. Therefore, the standard reference laboratory for BRCA2 sequencing and the only available commercial laboratory offering this test. Changing variables at this time will interrupt correct interpretation of experiment in progress.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.

The CPSB requires the purchase of data on serum IgG antiboides to whole-cell H. Pylori and the CagA antigen in cases of upper GI cancers and control, as to determine the association of the presence of H. Pylori and subsequent development of upper GI cancers.  CPSB/CCR conducts research in areas related to cancer prevention aimed at lowering human cancer risk.  Gastric and esophageal cancers, are the second and the eighth most common cancers in the world.  Linxian, China, has some of the highest rates of esophageal cancer in the world as well as cardia cancer, the age-standardized incidence rate for cancer is approximately 130/100,000 nearly 30 fold higher than the rate observed in the U.S.  Previous studies conducted by CPSB examined the association of H. Pylori with subsequent risk of cancers of the cardia and the body of the stomach, these associations have remained controversial, due to small sample sizes in previous studies.  These studies were done by Dr. Blaser's lab at New York University and is essential that the results of this study be comparable to the previous study to have sound scientific overall results.  NCI plans on conducting a large and definitive study, examining the association of H. Pylori and the risk of upper GI cancers.  This study will have a great impact on the treatment of patients infected with H. Pylori, a bacterium that infects about half of the world's population.  This study is part of a larger research program between China and the U.S., whose overall goal is to try to determine optimal strategies for the prevention and early detection of upper GI cancers in both China and U.S. The New York Uniersity School of Medicine is the only source known to the Government that can provide the above requriements specified.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Surveillance Research Program (SRP), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), plans to procure services for Data Collection and Statistical Reporting by the Central Brain Tumor Registry with Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States, 3333 West 47th Street, Chicago, Illinois 60632.  The services are being procured using simplified procedures as defined in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The incidence of brain tumors is increasing, particularly among older Americans. It is the second leading type of cancer among children and represents about 1 percent of all malignant tumors diagnosed each year.   Despite improvements in the diagnosis and management of brain tumors, prognosis for many with the disease is relatively poor.  In addition, the number of benign brain tumors is similar in magnitude to malignant tumors and may (often do) impose the same costs to society in terms of medical care, case fatality and lost productivity as malignant tumors.  The collection and dissemination of data on all primary brain tumors is an important surveillance and research priority for the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  The Brain Tumor Progress Review Group, a joint initiative of NCI and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, has identified the collection of data on all primary, malignant and benign brain tumors as a research priority.  The research will produce the biennial report and provide infrastructure support to support other statistical activity, analyze and disseminate data from the pooled data base, consult on classification of brain tumor data and interact with the national and international community, and conduct special studies.  CBTRUS will also be involved in the training and dissemination of training tools for promoting standards in the collection and analysis of all primary brain tumors.  Partial funding for these activities will come from organizations such as The American Brain Tumor Association, The National Brain Tumor Foundation, and The Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation of the United States.  The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS) is the only source known to the NCI that has established and maintained a speciality registry of primary brain and central nervous system tumors, including benign brain tumors, for the United States.  In addition, it is committed to providing a resource for gathering and disseminating current epidemiologic data on all primary brain tumors, benign and malignant, for the purposes of accurately describing their incidence and survival patterns, evaluating diagnosis and treatment, facilitating etiologic studies, establishing awareness of the disease, and ultimately for the prevention of all brain tumors.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intend to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Jeung-Shan Han, 12639 Georgia Avenue #101, Silver Spring, Maryland, 20906  to conduct research in the NHLBI, Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, to examine the effects on histone acetylation as well as histone acetylase/deacetylase activities and with mast cell lines and examine the effects of glucorticoids on functional response of the cells to antigen and other stimulants.    Dr. Han has conducted extensive research studies of histone acetylation.   The research examined the effects of glucocorticoids on histone acetylation in response to antigen stimulation in mast cell lines by use of assay systems established in Dr. Han?s laboratory.  Similar studies were conducted  in cells transfected with mutated forms of the glucocorticoid receptor using classical and novel corticosteroid ligands, and it was determined  whether or not the histone deacetylase inhibitors that were discovered by Dr. Han (e.g., apicidin) suppress the inhibitory actions of glucocorticoids in mast cells.  The work of Dr. Han?s laboratory has shown that glucorticoids such as dexamethasone suppress all functional responses in antigen-stimulated mast cells although certain responses (such as production of cytokines) are especially sensitive to the inhibitory actions of glucocorticoids.   In order to obtain the knowledge of the methodologies used in Dr. Han?s research an award to any other source would not be advantageous to the Government, and would result in a substantial increase of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The Statement of work is as follows: The Laboratory of Molecular Immunology (LMI) is conducting research studies of histone acetylation and recent results has shown that the glucocorticoids suppress activities of several transcription factors by interfering with histone acetylation thereby preventing access of the transcription factors to the appropriate cytokine gene promoter.   The LMI would like continue and expand their research in this area by utilizing the methodologies developed by Dr. Han in his research of histone acetylation.   Independently and as an agent of the Government, the Contractor will conduct experiments with mast cell lines and examine the effects of glucorticoids on functional response of the cells to antigen and other stimulants.  In addition he will examine effects on histone acetylation as well as histone acetylase/deacetylase activities by procedures that he has established in his own laboratory and as necessary instruct other laboratory members on these procedures.   Specifically the Contractor shall: 1)  Assess the extent of histone acetylation (and the associated histone acetylase/deacetylase activities) by procedures established in his laboratory in antigen-stimulated cells in RBL-2H3 cell line. Compare the extent of acetylation with that induced by mitogenic stimulants (Stem cell factor and IL-3) in mast cell lines dependent on these factors.  2) If as expected acetylation is stimulated determine the effect of dexamethasone on this stimulation. Functional responses such as secretion of granules and production of cytokines will be measured to assure that the effects of antigen and dexamethasone are optimized. Assistance will be provided as necessary.  3) Similar studies (as in item 2) will be conducted in cells transfected with mutated glucocorticoid receptors to determine whether the effects of glucocorticoids are due to transrepression or transactivation. The constructs for these mutants have been prepared and tested for expression.  4) Studies as outlined in items 2 and 3 will be conducted with ?dissociated steroids? and histone deacetylase inhibitors such as apicidin.  5) Establish procedures required for item 1 by teaching other laboratory workers how to run these procedures. In addition advise other workers on ongoing projects (particularly on projects related to phospholipase D) that might benefit from his experience.   The government will provide on-site laboratory space, furnish all necessary reagents, laboratory equipment, and computer facilities as needed.   Assistance will be provided by laboratory members who are conducting studies of the glucocorticoids in mast cell lines.  The period of performance is approximately eleven months from the date of award.   The contractor will work independently coordinating his efforts with the Project Officer.    The Government intends to award by October 1, 2002.  The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541990 and Standard Size is $6.0 million.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>Klinkner Dam
Vernon County Wisconsin
Statement of Work for Drilling Plan

Klinkner Dam was built in 1956.  The dam is presently in danger of breach through failure of the principal spillway joint separations.  In addition, two other NRCS dams built in the same rock formation in adjacent or nearby watersheds have failed or partially failed due to internal erosion of the rock abutments through vertical stress relief fractures.  

The purpose of the exploration is to 1) map the extent of the fracture system into the abutments and foundation of Klinkner Dam, 2) determine the spacing, width and fill material of the fractures, 3) find the bearing capacity of foundation materials that will be subjected to a greater load and 4) characterize the embankment material.  A combination of angle core drilling to intersect vertical fractures and water pressure testing to learn the permeability of the rock will be used. 

Water can be drawn from Knapp Creek at a rate of 1500 gallons per hour.  The Jordan Sandstone can be extremely pervious.  At a project in a nearby watershed the water takes in the Jordan Formation exceeded the pump capacity of the drill rig (60 gpm at 40 psi) through a 1-inch pipe.  There was no water return at any depth when drilling in this rock.

Pressure testing will only be done on holes 6, 8, 11 and 302.  It is likely that pressure testing intervals will be reduced to two or three feet if there is consistently no back pressure using the maximum capacity of the equipment.  Pressure testing may be discontinued if, after testing several holes at various depths, the water take exceeds the capacity of the equipment.  If similar results are found in hole 8 as in hole 6, pressure testing may be discontinued prior to testing the entire length of hole 8.

Excavation of at least one flat pad for the drill rig is required on each abutment.  A second pad will also be needed on the left abutment.  Additional drilling pads into the abutments may be requested by the COTR.  Drilling pads may also be required on the embankment if embankment material is extremely variable so that further test holes are needed. 

Major items of work:  Mobilization and Demobilization; Abutment Drilling Pad 3 EA; Hollow stem sampling system 161 FT; Rock core Boring (angle) 376 FT; Rock Core Boring (vertical) 146 FT; undisturbed samples, thin wall push tube  6 EA; Pressure testing 35 hours.  Range of cost is $25,000 to $100,000.  All responsible bidders can obtain a solicitation through www.fedbizopps.gov.  A site showing is scheduled for October 1 at 10:00 AM to meet at the Viroqua Service center.  For directions call Julie Hill at (608) 637-5480.  After a brief meeting concerning the bidding process and contract requirements, the group will tour the work site.

<DESC>Statement of Work (SOW) ? Non-Personal Services Contract
Speech and Language Pathologist

Acquisition Background and Objectives
Introduction:  The mission of the Indian Health Service (IHS) is to provide the best possible health care services to the Native American populations on the Indian Reservations throughout Montana and Wyoming.  The Indian Health Service intends on hiring a contractor into a temporary duty assignment within the Office of Health Care Programs at the Billings Area Office, in order to achieve this mission.  The contractor shall provide a number of work objectives for the department such as:

Provide speech services to children & adults; Identify, evaluate and rehabilitate disorders; Develop a comprehensive referral system and Provide Speech and Language Specialty Clinics

Performance Location:  The contractor will be carrying out their duties and fulfilling their contract with the Indian Health Service at the following health care facility location(s):

Indian Health Service, Crow Service Unit, 100 Hospital Way, Crow Agency, Montana 59022 and Indian Health Service, Northern Cheyenne Service Unit, 100 Cheyenne Avenue, Lame Deer, Montana 59043

Background Information:  The Billings Area Indian Health Service primarily serves thirteen tribal nations in the States of Wyoming and Montana.  The user populations are approximately 100,000 members annually; the Area Office facility is located in the south-central corner of the State of Montana.  There are twelve ambulatory health care hospitals and health centers located on/around the reservations and five urban health centers in the townships of Billings, Butte, Helena, Great Falls and Missoula.

Purpose of this Contract:  The primary purpose of this contract is to hire a contractor to assist the department/program in meeting their daily work objectives in providing quality health care services.  Currently this department does not have the necessary manpower and resources available to them in being able to complete both their short-term and long-term assigned duties.  As a result, a work backlog has developed, which adversely affects the department?s level of service being provided to the Indian community.  The services will be provided under the authority of Non-Personal Health Care Services Contract (FAR 37.4).

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with Dr. Ulf Griesmann to provide technical assistance to the Advanced Optics Metrology Program.  Dr. Griesmann has the knowledge required in the use of the instruments and knows the strengths and foibles of the two uniquely NIST tools as he has acted as a consultant for the past year.  The program has two near term goals: the ongoing development of the XCALIBIR Interferometer, an instrument intended for precise measurement of high performance optics; and IR^2, an instrument intended for global and precise measurements of the variation in thickness of large silicon wafers.  Dr. Griesmann will consult and advise on the technical aspect of the IR^2 upgrading activity, use the XCALIBIR Interferometer to measure the radius of curvature of the NIST glass "reference" sphere, perform the three-flat-test, and prepare a report to the technical community of the results.  Additionally, Dr. Griesmann will design and execute a "cooperative" experiment among NIST and the Kansas City University to test the use of XCALIBIR as a way to replace coherent beam x-ray topography to detect sub-surface damage on silicon wafers and further develop and test novel image processing methods to use with interferometry to minimize the effect of noise in interferograms.  

The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order on or about September 19, 2002.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, the Government will consider all capability statements received by September 19, 2002.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) No. D78033.  These solicitation clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27.  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code for this acquisition is 8999 and the North American Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710.  The FDA intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Kaiser Permanente for the following service: Design of Survey Questionnaire to be used in the Study of Comparison Rates of Myocardial Infarction (MI) between Patients Treated with Cyclo-Oxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2) and Traditional Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs).  The Contractor will expand the current study window to increase the time period covered and incorporate the additional data covering a total of 2.5 years.  The contractor will provide a completed survey questionnaire of 1000 randomly selected plan members who have been treated with COX-2 inhibitors, traditional NSAIDs or neither class of prescription drugs and provide a brief report describing the plans developed for conducting the survey.  The following FAR Clauses shall apply to this solicitation: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; and 52.232-33 Electronic Funds Transfers.  All responsible sources that can provide and meet the above requirements shall submit written quotations by the due date referenced above.  The award is being issued on a sole source basis because:  1. Kaiser Permanente already has a study of COX-2 and NSAID use and MI risk under way.  2. It is not possible for any organization or persons to access and use KP data; 3. To initiate a new study would result in extensive time delay and marked cost increases; 4. The KP database is very large; 5. Healthcare utilization data within the KP database are longitudinal at the plan member level; 6. Accurate patient enrollment files are available; 7. KP has the ability to link out-patient drug prescriptions and in[patient laboratory results data to individual plan members; 8. KP has well-established linkage to California mortality data and death certificates of plan members; 9. KP has the capacity to conduct voluntary surveys of plan members to investigate specific behaviors and other factors that may increase the risk of MI; and 10. KP has the ability to rapidly and completely obtain medical records for their review, when needed.  FAR provisions can be found on the following website: http://www/arnet.gov.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP) plans to enter into a sole source contract with Brown Medical School, 2 Stimson Ave, Rm 303, Box G-ST 303, Providence, RI 02912 to develop methods and materials for the purpose of surveying proxies for cancer patients identified and enrolled by the CanCORS Consortium for studies of quality of care.  The Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) Consortium is an ongoing Cooperative Agreement by the DCCPS, to evaluate the quality of cancer care in this country.  The goal of CanCORS is to examine the care delivered to population-based cohorts of newly diagnosed patients with lung and colorectal cancer in multiple regions of the country and to assess outcomes associated with that care.  CanCORS  uses the best available observational data and statistical techniques to identify clinically important differences in cancer treatment and outcomes and to evaluate the reasons for these differences across a broad range of health-care providers and organizations.  Research on the quality of care requires high quality information obtained from patients living with cancer or a proxy respondent that can provide some information about the subject's quality of care.  Proxy respondents requires a complex set of research issues to be addressed in order to ensure validity and reliability of any information obtained.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Cancer Preventions Studies Branch (CPSB), plans to enter into a sole source contract with University of Minnesota, Nutrition Coordinating Ctr, 1300 South 2nd Street, Suite 300, Minneapolis, MN 55454 for the analysis of 219 four day food records (4DRF) collected during the Polyp Prevention Trial (PPT).  The CPSB conducts intramural research in the areas of, genetics and cancer, nutrition and cancer, cancer chemoprevention, and other cancer prevention strategies aimed at lowering human cancer risk.  From June 1991 through November 1991 recruitment at eight Clinical Centers began for the  Polyp Prevention Trial (PPT).  The PPT was a randomized, controlled trial where the dietary goals for the intervention arm are 20% of calories from fat, 18g fiber/1000 kcal, and 5-8 servings of fruits and vegetables (the exact number based on caloric intake).  The last participant was randomized in early January 1994. A total of 38,277 potential participants were screened at the eight Clinical Centers. Of these, 2079 were randomized into the study, with 1037 in the intervention and 1042 in the control group.  T4 colonoscopic endpoint assessment and active intervention were completed in early April, 1998. Lymphocytes were isolated from blood from all participants of the PPT.  In the PPT 4DFR were collected annually and edited,  nutrient analysis of 4DFRs was done on 20% of the samples taken at random from all clinical centers.  CPSB now needs examine the 4DFRs from 219 who?s 4DRF were not initially analyzed to compare the fatty acids found in the adipose tissue to that in the diet records in order to validate dietary records and FFQs. The University of Minnesota, Nutrition Coordinating Center (NCC) edited all dietary records collected in the PPT and has previously analyzed 2079 food records and 1035 24 hour recalls from the PPT using their nutritent compostion database.  In order to compare the dietary data with the previously collected records from  the PPT we must have the Nutrition Coordinating Center, MN analyze these additional food records.   Validation of  the FFQ data in the PPT with NCC food records for total fat , fiber and fruits and vegetables has already been completed and if another vendor were to step in now another validation study would have to be performed.  This is not a request for competitive quotations, however, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement,  it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI research to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

No quotations or proposals are being sought at this time. A formal solicitation will be prepared and released at a future date and time.

Of the ?four thrusts? that have been instituted by the Director, DIA to address issues central to the defense intelligence community, none is more broad, complex, or open to widely varying interpretation than the Workforce Thrust. Also, none is more vital to our overall modernization effort.  Skilled people will continue to be the common denominator of successful intelligence support, regardless of the customer or mission.

The overarching intent of the proposed initiative is to identify the necessary DIA skill mix and balance to meet future mission requirements and transform DIA into a modern knowledge-based organization.  More specifically, the Government seeks a contractor to assist it with this proposed initiative and capture details of current workforce, project future workforce requirements, and establish a force structure transition plan.

The conference will be held to discuss DIA?s proposed initiative on 20 Sep 02 at 0900 hours, in building 6000, room B7-915, Bolling Air Force Base, Washington, DC. No classified information will be presented or discussed during the conference. Prospective attendees are encouraged to submit questions to the POC identified below. Questions, if any, should be submitted not later than two days prior to the date of the conference. To facilitate entry on to Bolling Air Force Base, attendees must provide the following information, not later than 16 Sep 02: individual name, company affiliation, social security number, date of birth, automobile plate number, make and year.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA), Office of the Regional Commissioner (ORC), Atlanta, Georgia is contracting for a Chief Medical Consultant in the specialty area of Psychology.  The services will be performed at the SSA office located at the Southeastern Program Service Center(SEPSC), 2001 12th Avenue North, Birmingham, Alabama 35285.  

 The Chief Medical Consultant will work in cooperation with the Branch Manager to ensure a high level of quality in the reviews done by the SEPSC DBP medical consultant contractors. The Chief Medical Consultant:
?X Coordinates the review of samples of the work done by the SEPSC DBP medical consultant staff to insure that these reviews are consistent with Social Security disability policy.  When differences arise between the medical consultants or between medical consultants and Social Security staff, the Chief Medical Consultant will mediate to resolve these in an equitable manner.  
?X will help identify training needs for the medical consultants.  Medical consultant performance issues which impact on the program would be referred directly to the Branch Manager.
?X is expected to exercise a high level of competence and professional courtesy in dealing with the SEPSC DBP medical consultants.  In all activities, due recognition must be extended to the opinions of all consultants.  When it is necessary to change or make a more definitive decision on a case, the involved consultant should be apprised of the decision if it contributes to meeting the learning needs or program consistency.  Sensitive action in this area is essential to the recruitment and retention of medical consultants.
?X will be expected to review highly technical cases which require unusual expertise to resolve pertinent case-related issues.  Assistance from other medical consultants will be available to help resolve issues in specific specialty areas, however, the ultimate decision on technical issues will usually rest with the Chief Medical Consultant.
?X will serve as a medical liaison for the SEPSC DBP to the Regional Medical Advisor.
?X will also be available to the State Chief Medical officers in the states in the SEPSC region to discuss medical policy issues.  
?X will represent the SEPSC DBP at various medical policy meetings both regionally and nationally.
?X may occasionally be required to attend and/or give program-related training to State Disability Services employees in locations other than the SEPSC.  However, the great majority of services will be performed in the SEPSC.
In addition to the administrative responsibilities outlined above, the Chief Medical Consultant will provide direct clinical support to the DBP, as dictated by program needs. There will be no contacts with patients.  The period of performance shall be one year or date of award, whichever is later than December 31, 2002, with provisions for four one-year option periods.  The solicitation number is SSA-RFQ-03-7604-02 and is scheduled for release on or about October 14, 2002, with quotations due 14 days later. No telephone requests for RFQ will be honored. REQUESTS may be telefaxed to (404)562-5735 or mailed to Joyce A. Brewster, SSA/APMT, 61 Forsyth Street,SW; Suite 22T64;Atlanta, GA  30303-8907.  This requirement is a 100% small business set aside.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT.  The Bureau of Engraving & Printing is seeking all commercial businesses as well as those in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., area in order to prepare for an OMB Circular 
A-76 Streamlined process to occur over the period November 2002 to February 2003 timeframe.  This A-76 Streamlined Process is based on the assumption that the commercial activity (CA) under study is regularly performed by contract either in the commercial or government operating environments at (Firm Fixed Price), and that existing contracts can be used, with only minor modifications, to define the scope of the competition and avoid the need to develop a new or original PWS or a formal solicitation.

Therefore, firms and ISSA activities which have current federal prime government contracts for Accounting services, specifically the accounts payable sub-function and are of a functional size of 10 or less FTE accounting technicians should respond to this notice.   The accounts payable sub-function involves invoice receipt, matching with purchase, travel and other types of orders which must be validated, reconciled, processed, and properly submitted for payment in accordance with Bureau processing procedures.  Parties which have current contracts for accounts payable/invoice processing must respond with the 1) contract number 2) point of contact 3) the total firm fixed price amount on a yearly basis, and or Time and Material cost dollars involved for the period of performance covered.  Also firms must respond as to the 4)size and business status, i.e., 8A, SB, Veteran Owned and 5) if there are any similar commercial contracts in the same functional area.  Note: THIS IS NOT AN RFP OR RFQ AT THIS TIME, however, under the Streamlined process it may become one.  If 4 (four) current Federal Prime contracts are not available with which to make a Contract Cost range determination against the Government current costs, then a more formal IFB process will be used.

<DESC>This is notice that WR-ALC anticipates issuing a contract to BAE, Nashua NH for the acquisition of spare parts and repairs for items that are determined to be sole source to BAE.  The initial award will focus on items within FSC 5895.  Other sole source items outside of FSC 5895 will be included throughout the life of the contract.  A fixed price type contract is contemplated for a total of ten years.  An award fee clause based on delivery performance may be included.   

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the
purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application. The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation. To request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or  call DLSC at the above number. The solicitation/data package will be mailed to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time it is initially issued. Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).  

Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.


Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT/CONTRACT INFO SOUGHT.  The Bureau of Engraving & Printing is seeking commercial businesses in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., area in order to prepare for an OMB Circular A-76 Streamlined process to occur over the period January 2003 to February 2003 timeframe.  This A-76 Streamlined Process is based on the assumption that the commercial activity (CA) under study is regularly performed by contract either in the commercial or government operating environments at Firm Fixed Price, and that existing Federal contracts can be used, with only minor modifications, to level and define the scope of the competition and avoid the need to develop a new or original PWS or a formal solicitation.

Therefore, firms and ISSA activity?s which have experience and also have CURRENT government contracts for Security Service Administration Service Support, specifically the administration of: badging (processing, producing, Issuing  regular and temporary BEP badges), issuing regular and temporary parking permits, updating and maintaining badge data and records, designing badges, ensuring badge room security, assisting in service support of security personnel, general clerical duties such as travel, admin support, processing visitor request forms, reception, visitor escort and open/close support center service area  should respond to this notice.   All work is in accordance with Bureau procedures.  All interested and capable parties which have expertise in the security support administration should respond with a list of their 1) contract number, 2) point of contact 3) the firm fixed price of each contract, and or total Time and Material cost dollars involved for the period of performance covered.  Also firms should respond as to the 4) size and business status, i.e., 8A, SB, Veteran Owned, etc? and 6) if they have any similar commercial contracts in the same functional area  NOTE: THIS IS NOT AN RFP OR RFQ AT THIS TIME, however, under the Streamlined process it may become one.  If 4 (four) current prime federal contracts (within 12 months or less) are not available with which to make a contract cost range determination against the Government?s current costs, then a more formal IFB process will be used later per the OMB Circular.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  This document is for information and planning purposes and to promote competition.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued by the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) to seek industry comments and inputs concerning the maintenance and operation of the National Snow and Ice Distributed Active Archive Center (NSIDC).  In addition, insights on the transitioning of existing DAAC hardware to a new site are welcomed.   This EOSDIS DAAC is required to process and distribute snow and ice data products needed for Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) research, as well as snow and ice data products generated from ESE instruments which are useful to the broader science community and educational institutions.	This DAAC is responsible for managing the polar data and data products from SSM/I, AMSR, GLAR and MODIS, and derived products from these instruments.  This DAAC will support its user community by providing cryospheric data and information services, assisting in locating and manipulating data not archived at the DAAC, and serving as a point of contact for the development and implementation of new geophysical algorithms to derive standard snow and ice products. The ESDIS Project is interested in awarding or renewing a contract for acquiring and archiving snow and ice type data with a group that would work cooperatively with the ESDIS Science Operations Office (SOO) and the Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs).  The functions of this facility would include, but are not limited to:  1) Acquire new data streams needed to meet ESE science objectives. 2) Acquire, produce, archive and distribution snow and ice data products from ESE or other closely related instruments, as well as supporting/validation data from in-situ sources. 3) Facilitate the use of those products in modeling cryosphere-climate systems processes.  4) Share DAAC expertise with the user community. 5) Process passive microwave data using algorithms provided by EOS-funded investigators. 6) Implement and/or test existing and new algorithms to derive geophysical products from satellite imagery. 7) Collecting information needed for specifying EOSDIS requirement. 8) Review and test enhancements of the ECS. 9) Track user requests and user needs to access resources in greatest demand. 10) Conduct system engineering studies of the DAAC needs. 11) Support the ECS verification and acceptance test activities at the DAAC. 12) Operate and maintain the DAAC, including ECS elements deployed to the DAAC. 13) Populate and update the Global Change Master Directory with information about data sets available from the DAAC. 14) Prepare and disseminate information on DAAC activities. 15) Develop and implement methods to ensure data integrity. 16) Particpate in the EOSDIS Operations Working Group. 17) Establish and maintain an effective DAAC User Working Group. 18) Establish and maintain a formal configuration management process 19) Provide regular activity and financial reports.  20) Interact with the Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) Alliance and NASA Headquarters. 21) Strong understanding of the cryospheric user community. 22) Fully staffed with trained engineers and operators Geographic Constraints: 1) This facility should be resident at or have a strong partnership with a university to encourage education outreach, academic involvement and scientific research. Infrastructure Constraints: 1) Site must posses an acceptable level on personnel and network security.   2) The facility should already exist and require little modification. 3) Data networks and communication systems should already be in place and available for use. Management Constraints: 1) Management and personnel should already be familiar with managing data acquisition, product generation, archiving, and distribution of cryospheric science data. 2) Management must have experience coordinating and conducting operations with NASA and foreign agencies. For an understanding of the scope of the maintenance and operation of this DAAC respondents should review the provided references. These documents serve as a backdrop against which respondents must frame and pose the appropriate advanced information technology topics for further consideration: Reference     URL  1.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), MacDill AFB, FL,  intends to procure a dropwindsonde launcher assembly for the Gulfstream GIV aircraft from Aeromet, Tulsa, OK. The NOAA Aircraft Operations Center maintains and operates a Gulfstream GIV aircraft for weather research and reconnaissance.  The primary function of this aircraft is to launch dropwindsonde (henceforth referred to as sondes) into th atmosphere at high altitudes.  After being launched from the aircraft, a parachute pops out of the sonde.  The sonde collects atmospheric data as it descends to the ocean.  This data is transmitted back to the aircraft and eventually transmitted to scientists on land.  The scientists use this data to help understand the windflow around the weather systems.  This information is used to better predict where storms such as hurricanes will make landfall.  These predictions are used by emergency managers to determine which areas of coastline should be evacuated.  The intended procurement is for a sondes launcher assembly for a Gulfstream GIV aircraft which the Government intends to acquire from one source, Aeromet, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time.  The Government reserves the right to solicit proposals based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue a purchase order to Aeromet,  whichever is determined to be most advantageous to the Government, without further notice.  All interested parties must submit in writing the following:   name; address; point of contact; telephone number; business size and a brief statement regarding it's capability to provide the specified sondes launcher and the names; telephone numbers; and points of contact for businesses or other Government agencies to which it has previously provided similar equipment.   No response will be provided to those inquiries which fail to provide the information requested.  This information should be faxed to 816-426-7530, Attn: Sharon Clisso.  A determination by the Government not to compete this  requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The NAICS code is 541710.  The small business standard is 1000 employees.  This is not a small-business set-aside.  The sondes launcher will be purchased under the guidelines of FAR, Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), MacDill AFB, FL,  intends to procure two fast response open-path fiber-coupled aircraft hygrometers, Model ACOP-137 for NOAA's P-3 aircraft from Buck Research Instruments, LLC, Boulder, CO.  Dewpoint temperature is a fundamental flight level measurement provided on NOAA's P-3 aircraft.  Accurate and fast responding moisture measurements have become a requirement in many areas of atmospheric research.  In order to support NOAA's scientific users AOC must provide quality airborne fast dewpoint measurement in the form of a dependable instrument that maintains long term accuracy and does not require frequent maintenance or servicing (purging sample chamber, replacing tubes, frequent calibration, etc.).  An open-path fiber-coupled Tunable Laser Diode(TLD) aircraft hygrometer will provide the accuracy and response needed to support NOAA's P-3 users.  The compact instrument design, long service life of the laser, and low system maintenance make the laser hygrometer an ideal instrument for aircraft based water vapor measurement.  Buck Research Instruments LLC provides custom built open-path fiber-coupled TLD aircraft hygrometer for atmospheric research organizations in the US and overseas.  The aircraft laser hygrometer requested is designed specifically for operation in the extreme environment encountered by NOAA aircraft during research flights.  The intended procurement is for two fast response open-path fiber-coupled aircraft hygrometers, model ACOP-137, which the Government intends to acquire from one source, Buck Research Instruments, LLC, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time.

<SUBJECT>D -- Joint Venture partner to help develop and provide a hosted e-Learning and Knowledge Management servide for high-security federal agencies.
<DESC>The National Technical Information Service (NTIS), an agency at the Department of Commerce, Technology Administration, is looking for a joint venture partner to help develop and provide a hosted e-Learning and Knowledge Management service for high-security federal agencies.  The business opportunities described in this notice are joint ventures, require investments by prospective partners and yield a revenue sharing opportunity.  NTIS enters into joint venture partnerships in accordance with the authority granted to NTIS in the National Technical Information Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 3704b) and in accordance with the guidelines published in the June 13, 1989 Federal Register.  Joint ventures do not involve procurements using government funds.

Because the partner is expected to develop an integrated system which meets all the stated technical requirements, NTIS envisions the participation of one or more companies which may all be partners if that is what they agree to do.  If the companies are not all to be partners, their relationship to each other must be specified in the proposal.  In addition, at least one of the joint venture partners, when selected by NTIS, must currently be in the learning/knowledge management software business.  The partner(s) is (are) expected to use its (their) capabilities to provide software (and possibly, related hardware) that will deliver e-Learning and Knowledge Management to federal employees operating in secure IT environments.  The software will manage users, students, courses, testing, collaboration, reporting, and its internal security.

NTIS envisions partnering with a company or companies to develop an integrated system to deliver and manage on-line and off-line learning and organizational knowledge through a hosted, web-enabled secure environment for federal agencies that require a heightened level of security and the ability to interface to certain government networks.  The system will include delivery of learning objects, as well as the acquisition, management and dissemination of organizational knowledge objects within secure IT environments.  NTIS expects to contribute personnel, hardware, IT, security and Help Desk support functions and expertise gained through continuous operation of state-of-the-art hosted e-Learning services for government clients behind Federal firewalls.

Complete responses may include more than one firm in order to meet all listed requirements of this RFI.  Any such arrangement should be described within the response, to delineate points of contact.  Presentations may be made at the request of NTIS.  Any such presentation must cover all aspects of this RFI, and integrate all functions into a single response.

A revenue sharing agreement will be a result of this partnership to provide returns to the successful party.  Anticipated revenue streams should be addressed in the response.  The solution provided by the partner(s) will enable the partnership to provide a customized integrated solution to NTIS for use by federal agencies, consisting of at least the following features:

4.	Create course sections with varying admissions rules
5.	Manage student enrollment, progress, training history, prerequisites, equivalents and descendant courses
6.	Flexible and comprehensive test engine using TLO and ELO question hierarchy test structures with multiple question types and supporting IMS QTI specification
7.	Multilevel document management capabilities
8.	Full access to existing Federal identity verification systems
9.	Basic reporting capability at multiple functional levels, plus ability to interface with standard COTS datamining and reporting tools to provide more sophisticated statistical information
10.	Fully compliant and able to launch SCORM courses starting with version 1.1 through current and future versions. Ability to manage offline learning, including a downloadable course player, ability to download SCORM compliant courseware, full offline functionality and ability to synchronize progress with LMS when online
11.	Ability to manage both military and civilian user profiles
12.	Design and manage for security, including manage and assign user roles and provide for security between tiers within the LMS. Use cryptography techniques to protect sensitive information, including triple DES and AES technologies

For Knowledge Management:
1.	Open and component-based architecture using J2EE and Java, JSP, ESB, XML and providing a simplified upgrade path
2.	Ability to interface with multiple industry-standard RDBMS
3.	Multilevel document management capabilities
4.	Access, acquire, categorize and manage common document types, including (but not limited to): .doc, .ppt, .pdf, .xls and email
5.	Access, acquire, categorize and manage common graphic file types, including (but not limited to): .gif, .tif, .eps and .jpg
6.	Manage knowledge object history

NTIS will evaluate responses based on criteria listed above. Prospective partners are required to describe and reference the technical capabilities of their products, describe technical expertise and provide a concise description of their experience and their ability to provide NTIS with necessary technical training in the use of the software.

NTIS has for more than fifty years fulfilled its mission of acquiring and disseminating information obtained from both government and private sector sources worldwide in response to the needs of government agencies, and the general public.  NTIS is also responsible for implementing new methods or media for disseminating information, including producing and disseminating information products in electronic format.

For the past four years, NTIS has provided hosted e-Learning services to a Federal client.  As a self-supporting government agency NTIS offers unique security and operating value to Federal agencies.  This joint venture would serve Federal agencies that require such value.

NTIS operates a clearinghouse for the information it collects, delivering bibliographic databases, and content selected by consumers in paper and electronic format, and also supports the fulfillment needs of users for the delivery of historic or archived materials produced in print-on-demand paper, demand microform or CD-ROM, or via on-line electronic access.  If you have any questions about these activities, please send them via e-mail to pgresham@ntis.gov, Fax (703) 605-6888.

Offerors should limit their proposal to twenty-five (25) pages, excluding graphic appendices.  Offerors must provide three hard copies of their proposal to Janice Long Coe, Associate Director, Office of Business Development at the above address by the response date specified in this announcement.

<SUBJECT>--Request for Information (RFI): Use of Joint Tactical Radio Systems (JTRS) Software Communications Architecture (SCA) above 2 GHz
<DESC>NA The Government seeks information from contractors familiar with the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Software Communications Architecture (SCA) on ongoing industry efforts to use the JTRS SCA in radio terminals operating in frequency bands above 2 GHz. T he JTRS is a DoD overarching program to develop a family of multi-mode, multi-band, programmable radios based on a common architecture. Currently, the JTRS program covers the requirements for radio systems operating from 2 MHz to 2 GHz. Major advances in t echnology have been achieved since the JTRS program started, and the desire to extend the JTRS SCA beyond 2 GHz (up to 55 GHz) has emerged as a new opportunity. OASD(C3I), in conjunction with the JTRS Joint Program Office (JPO), PM MILSATCOM, and ASN(R&D),  is currently studying the feasibility, cost, and expected benefits of extending the JTRS SCA to include MILSATCOM terminals above 2 GHz. To this end, CECOM, on behalf of the JTRS JPO, solicits information on current and anticipated industry efforts to dev elop SCA-based terminals that operate above 2 GHz.  Areas of interest include: (1) industry studies or assessments as to feasibility or impact of using the SCA, (2) systems engineering, modeling, and prototyping efforts, (3) proposed terminal concepts or d esigns, and (4) enabling technologies (both software and hardware). Information on industry research into using the SCA in space-based applications is also desired. Both contractors and sub-contractors are invited to respond. The intent of this RFI is to g ather information in order to assess the current state of technology, identify technology trends, and learn of industry intentions, in support of the OASD(C3I) study. This RFI is not a request for proposals. The Government will not award a contract on the basis of this announcement, or otherwise pay for information solicited by it. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the governments us e of submitted information. The requested information is for planning purposes, and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that any procurement will be issued. Information may be submitted either via mail or electronically (preferred), or both. Mailed information shall be sent to Mr. Craig Drew, US Army Communications-Electronics Command, CECOM Acquisition Center Washington, ATTN: AMSEL-AC-W, 2461 Eisenhower Avenue, Alexandria, VA 22331-0700. Electronic information shall be sent to craig.dr ew@saalt.army.mil. It is requested that all information be provided within 30 days of the posting of this announcement. Any proprietary information should be clearly marked and, to the extent feasible, separated from any unrestricted information.

The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334516, and the business size is 500 employees.  This system shall include, but not be limited to, and meet or exceed the following performance characteristics, features, and pertain to the following components:  (1)  Shall include a spectral scanner that incorporates a 32 channel PMT using a grating for high speed, efficient, electronic switching between spectrally separated detector elements.  (2)  Both binning and spectral scanning must be electronically managed by software via simple single button selection.  (3) Must have high kinetic response of the system for lie cell and whole animal experiments.  (4)  Spectral characterization of multi labeled specimen with 10.7nm resolution that can be squired over 86nm of spectral information pixel by pixel in single pass of the laser over the specimen.  (5)  No more than four passes can achieve 350nm with at least 10.7nm resolution, and it can be done in 2 passes at 21.4nm resolution.  (6)  Electronic switching must allow rapid collection between channels with fewest scans.  (7)  System must be capable of Emission Fingerprinting with at least 10.7nm collection upon delivery and support of all acquisition modes x,y,z,t and lambda RAPIDLY.  (8)  Performance must include rapid spectral curve generation using a lambda stack that is collected pixel by pixel 12 bit up to 2K X 2K, and generated from any ROI for immediate plot of spectral information.  (9)  The system must be able to generate Lambda - time stack of at least 80nm of lambda information in single pass of the image for high speed kinetic acquisition.  (10)  System must be able to achieve the same kinetic rate for z + lambda stacks as well as z, time, lambda stacks.  (11)  Spectrol detector should allow electronic high speed selection of wavelength range including quick and easy switching between overlapping band pass channels, which allows extreme efficiency in the collection mode where high speed response is needed and generally much light loss occurs.  (12)  The system must allow for AOM coupling of external Coherent TI Sapphire Mira laser, fully tunable between 700-1000nm.  (13)  Line selection and attenuation must be rapid, continuous with at least .1% increments, and fully selectable with ALL laser lines coupled to the system.

STATEMENT OF WORK FOR DESKTOP SECURITY INCIDENT MEASUREMENT SCOPE:  The primary STATEMENT OF WORK FOR object of this SOW is to provide AFIWC/IOD with continued development and enhancement of the Desktop Security Incident Measurement (DSIM) initiative.  Current Air Force security tools monitor and protect physical networks with the assumption that hosts are protected indirectly.  The goal of DSIM is to provide a hybrid network-centric intrusion detection system (NIDS) with firewall capabilities to the workstation level.  The DSIM firewall capabilities will provide a dual-sided firewall that will help enforce security policy and that can be remotely configured and controlled.  The dual-sided firewall is designed to protect the desktop originating attacks.  The DSIM NIDS component will monitor for suspicious activity, malicious activity, attempted intrusion, and actual intrusion and will report this activity to the DSIM server and then to the Common Intrusion Detection Director System (CIDDS).
