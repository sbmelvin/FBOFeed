<DESC>Waiver to Synopsis required IAW FAR 5.201 Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-16-02745 solicitation SPRTA1-17-Q-0007 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13), exception:
(i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold
(ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE.
(iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.
Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.  Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized.
Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons is seeking concerns having the ability for providing Residential Reentry center (RRC) services (in-house RRC beds) and Home Confinement services (home confinement placements) for male and female Federal offenders held under the authority of United States Statutes located within the state of Rhode Island.
<p><br />Both the RRC services for in-house RRC beds and the Home Confinement services for home confinement placements shall be in accordance with the Federal Bureau of Prisons Statement of Work entitled, "Residential Reentry Center, August 2007; Revision 01 December 2007 CCB; Revision 02, December 2008, CCB, Revision 03, February 2010 CCB, Revision 04, May 2010 CCB, Revision 05, May 2011, CCB; Revision 06, January 2012, RRMB; Revision 07, February 2012, RRMB; Revision 08, January 2013 RRMB". Home Confinement services (for home confinement placements) are specifically defined in chapter 10, programs, of the aforementioned SOW. Additional requirements for these services are referenced throughout the SOW as well. <br />This will be for (an) indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type contract(s) with firm fixed unit prices for Line Item 1 and Line Item 2.</p>
<p>The RRC requirement will be for a guaranteed minimum of eleven (11) in-house male inmate days with an estimated maximum of twenty-two (22) in-house male inmate days, and a guaranteed minimum of one (1) in-house female inmate day with an estimated maximum of three (3) in-house female inmate days for the one-year Base Period; and for a guaranteed minimum of eleven (11) in-house male inmate days with an estimated maximum of twenty-two (22) in-house male inmate days, and a guaranteed minimum of one (1) in-house female inmate day with an estimated maximum of three (3) in-house female inmate days for each of the four one-year option periods thereafter, if any options are exercised.</p>

<p>It is the intent of the Government to award both line items (RRC in-house beds and home confinement placements) to a single provider, as these services are interconnected and rely upon each other to ensure adequate programming and case management of offenders. The Government reserves the right to potentially make an award which is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>RFP-200-1265-ES will be available on or about September 8, 2014, and it will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>THIS POSTING IS BEST VIEWED AT HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV, KEYWORD: Spectrometer.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma has a requirement  for annual maintenance/calibration, repair, emergency service calls and replacement parts for three (3) Perkin Elmer Turbo Mass Spectrometers and one (1) ION MGS 110 located in the Civil Aerospace Medical Institutes Environmental Physiology Research Lab. 

The Environmental Physiology Research Team requires mass spectrometer data for every research project it conducts. The equipment is essential to our mission and there is no alternative means to support the maintenance and calibration requirements outlined in the manufacturing service specifications. Without atmospheric and respiratory gas composition measurements, no high altitude research would be possible. These instruments require maintenance on a bi-annual basis to maintain their accuracy. 

MA Tech Services, St. Louis, MO is the only known source providing maintenance and calibration services for these Perkin Elmer mass spectrometers who is authorized to refurbish and maintain equipment used for aviation.

The requirement will be for one base period with two (1) one-year option periods.

The intent of this market survey is to permit companies that may possess the technical capabilities to meet this requirement an opportunity to provide specific information as to their unique capabilities as specified in this announcement. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENT: 

Qualified vendors are invited to submit documentation evidencing the possession of the following capabilities:

        Number of years in business
2. Completed Business Declaration Form, attached.

Respondents must be active in the System for Award Management (SAM) (www.sam.gov).

Each of the sluice gates is a 10'-5 &frac34;" high by 6'-8" wide cast steel structure, constructed in 1956 and made of Grade 65-30 steel. There are also three (3) bulkhead stop logs that can be placed together in a single intake conduit to dewater the gates for that conduit and perform maintenance and inspection work on them.

<DESC>Synopsis:<br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District, has a requirement for gate control upgrades located at the Braddock Locks and Dam, located on the Monongahela River, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. <br />The general description of the work is as follows:<br />The Braddock Dam Gate Control System Upgrade focuses on the migration from a Rockwell Automation (RA) SLC 500 based control system to an open architecture Rockwell Automation Logix based control system utilizing Ethernet communications. The existing dam gate control system consists of four Rockwell Automation SLC 5/04 processors, one per dam gate, communicating via Data Highway Plus (DH+) on fiber optic cable to one Human Machine Interface (HMI) personal computer (PC). Each individual dam gate SLC 5/04 processor communicates locally to two RA Remote I/O racks and a RA Dataliner display.<br />Upon completion of the upgrade, the new dam gate control system shall consist of four RA CompactLogix PLC processors, one for each dam gate, and three HMI PCs communicating via Ethernet. The existing SLC 5/04 processors and Remote I/O modules shall be replaced with RA 1747-AENTR modules. A new RA CompactLogix PLC processor and Stratix managed Ethernet switch shall be mounted in a new enclosure mounted next to each existing local dam gate control station. The existing Dataliner and gate position LCD displays shall be replaced with a RA PanelView Plus 6 (700 Model) graphic display touch screen terminal with Ethernet communications.<br />The existing Engineering laptop PC and dam gate control desktop PC shall be replaced with new government furnished PCs. All programming software, operator interface software, and communications shall be upgraded or provided as new to form a complete control system on a Windows 7 operating system installed by the Corps of Engineers on the Government furnished PCs. A total of three PCs shall be Government furnished equipment; one PC shall be connected to the Ethernet dam gate control network in the middle wall operations building, one PC shall be connected to the Ethernet dam gate control network via fiber optic cable in the land wall administration building, and one laptop PC shall be connected to the Ethernet dam control network in the middle wall operations building. Currently, only the middle wall PC is operating as a standalone RSView SE HMI operator interface terminal. The RSView SE software on the middle wall PC will have to be upgraded to the latest compatible version of FTView SE. The new PC on the land wall shall also be configured as a standalone HMI operator interface terminal and one new FTView SE license will be required.. The laptop PC shall be configured as an Engineering work station and shall contain new RSLogix5000 and Studio 5000 fully licensed programming software.<br />The existing fiber optic cabling between the dam and the middle wall operations building shall be utilized for Ethernet communications. Two new 24-fiber fiber optic cables shall be installed, terminated, and tested between the land wall administration building and the second floor of the middle wall operations building. The new fiber optic cables shall be routed in existing raceways, cable trays, and conduits where available. The lock chamber crossover is normally flooded and shall be pumped out by site personnel. All existing copper DH+ and Remote I/O cables shall be removed. All new Ethernet cables and copper to fiber media converters shall be provided as necessary for communications between devices.<br />Magnitude of the project is between $250,000 and $500,000. <br />This procurement is 100% set aside for Women-Owned Small Business Concerns. All responsible offerors are encouraged to participate. The period of performance for this procurement is estimated to be 180 calendar days after written Notice To Proceed. The location where the work will be performed is at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Braddock Locks and Dam, 11th Street, Braddock, PA 15104. <br />The Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be issued approximately 27 October 2016, online through Federal Business Opportunities (fbo.gov), therefore, requests for hardcopies of the solicitation will not be honored. In order to receive notification of any amendments to this solicitation, interested vendors must register as an interested vendor on the Federal Business Opportunities website.

<DESC>F108-100 Main Engine Control and Component Strategy, 429 SCMS, Request for Information/Sources Sought Synopsis
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (RFI/SSS): This RFI/SSS is issued as market research, solely for informational and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotation) or promise to issue a solicitation in the future. The information provided in response to this RFI/SSS is for discussion purposes, and any potential strategy developed from this discussion would be the subject of a separate future announcement.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMERS: As stated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers, and shall not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. As stated in FAR 52.215-3, "Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes"; the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI/SSS or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except possibly as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in FAR 31.205-18, "Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs."</p>
<p>The information received in response to this RFI/SSS may be utilized by the United States Air Force (USAF) in developing an acquisition strategy and requirement documents (i.e.; Statement of Objectives, Performance Work Statement, or Purchase Description). The Government requests non-proprietary information be submitted in response to this RFI/SSS. However, should proprietary information or trade secrets be submitted, it should be clearly identified and marked "PROPRIETARY", and handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for the use of any proprietary information submitted and not properly identified. Proprietary information shall be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. The government has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed. Release of this RFI/SSS shall not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become property of the USAF and will not be returned. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI/SSS. Response to the RFI/SSS is strictly voluntary. Submissions may be reviewed by the Government personnel and contractors in support of the Government.</p>
<p>PURPOSE: The Enterprise Tinker Commodity Council (ETCC) within the 429th Supply Chain Management Squadron (SCMS) located at Tinker Air Force Base issued this RFI/SSS requesting information for market research purposes pursuant to FAR Part 10. The Government will use this information to determine the best future acquisition strategy for this procurement, inclusive of the need to do an Industry Day and/or a Pre-solicitation Conference. The Government is seeking capabilities and sources to perform remanufacture of the F108 Main Engine Control (MEC) as outlined in Statement of Objective (SOO) section. These requirements are for USAF. This is an initial SOO being considered for inclusion on a strategic contract to aid in planning, however; this SOO is subject to change and not binding to the Government. The information in this notice is based on current information available to date and updated information will be provided in future announcements.</p>
<p>PROBLEM: The F108 engine is currently undergoing an upgrade to C-PUP configuration. This upgraded configuration provides enhanced performance and operational capability. To get the full enhanced package of performance and operational capability, USAF engineering has required an expanded "on condition maintenance" (repair) criteria to a one time remanufacture effort for the F108 MEC. National Stock Numbers (NSNs) and Part Numbers (P/Ns) are listed in Table 1, which includes the incorporation of any outstanding Service Bulletins (SBs) listed in Table 2, to be accomplished on all 1900 MECs in the USAF inventory at a rate of 54 remanufactured MECs per month. The organic depot repair facility does not have the full capability to meet the new remanufacture requirements/schedule.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE (SOO): The overall objective is to provide affordable, reliable, and on time serviceable condition F108 MECs that have had all outstanding SBs accomplished. The objective must also meet the USAF schedule of 54 remanufactured MECs per month, while addressing the cause(s) for the current lack of waRFI/SSSghter support and any future issues or concerns that may affect availability. Approach must seek to deliver product support designed to optimize system readiness. At a minimum, the solution must achieve the following objectives:</p>
<p>1. Furnish supplemental F108 MEC remanufacture capabilities and facilities to augment depot organic remanufacture capacity to increase throughput and reduce bottlenecks and constraints. <br />a) Supplemental capabilities should include solutions that help reduce organic MEC remanufacture time to help the depot organic shop meet the USAF schedule.<br />b) Meet all source approval requirements for F108 MEC remanufacture via Source Approval Request (SAR) process <br />2. Supply engineering and technical support to complement USAF cognizant engineering specific to the remanufacturing, testing, and troubleshooting of F108 MECs. <br />a) Engineering and technical support should include solutions that more closely align with industry best practices and governmental work.<br />b) Support should also improve availability, reliability, affordability, and maintainability of F108 MECs.<br />3. Provide piece part product support integration in support of organic remanufacture.<br />a) Integration includes determining quantity of parts, purchasing of needed parts, warehousing, issuing, and documenting of usage.<br />4. The Government will retain ownership rights to all engineering/technical data incorporated into Government TOs and processes.</p>
<p>Contract instrument must offer the needed supply chain resiliency to the government to proactively respond to changing future requirements and circumstances.<br />______________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Based on responses to this RFI/SSS, an anticipated solicitation or series of solicitations may be issued to pursue opportunities for contract award. A Pre-Solicitation notice will be published in Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) prior to the release of any solicitation generated from the information gathered in response to this RFI/SSS. Failure to respond will not preclude participation in future solicitations. It is the intent of the Government to maximize competition whenever and wherever possible. Responses to this notice will be considered for discussions to determine the best future acquisition and contract strategies.</p>
<p>SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION: Responses from small business firms are highly encouraged. The Government is seeking small businesses interested in participation, to include but not limited to: Small Business, Small Disadvantage Business, 8(a) Certified, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hub-Zone Small Business, and Women-Owned Small Business concerns. The Government requests interested parties respond to this notice as a prime or subcontractor as applicable.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice for Request for Information (RFI) Number DOL-ETA-17-N-00002. The government reserves the right to compete any acquisition resulting from this notice. This sources sought notice is for planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to pay for the information requested, issue a solicitation, or award a contract.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL
<p>The United States Department of Labor, Employment &amp; Training Administration is conducting market research for the upcoming procurement requirement for student-centered design academic models. The NAICS Code is 611310, with a size standard of $27.5M.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Job Corps program, housed within the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the U.S. Department of Labor, provides a holistic career development training approach which integrates the teaching of academic, career technical, employability skills, and social competencies through a combination of classroom and practical learning experiences. The program operates a 24 hour-a-day residential environment to prepare opportunity youth ages 16 to 24 for stable, long-term, self-sustaining jobs.</p>
<p>Job Corps is the nation's largest residential educational and career training program for youth ages 16 through 24. Each year the program serves approximately 60,000 young men and women at 125 centers across the country and in Puerto Rico. Established in 1964, Job Corps is currently authorized under Title I-C of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014, and is administered by the National Office of Job Corps with oversight of Job Corps centers conducted through its regional offices located in Boston, MA; Philadelphia, PA; Atlanta, GA; Chicago, IL; Dallas, TX; and San Francisco, CA. The primary mission of Job Corps is to provide young adults with the tools necessary to attain meaningful jobs that lead to career growth.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>In order to better prepare its students to meet the high expectations of the 21st century workplace, Job Corps is restructuring its academic design approach to better align with standards-based education and training. In this construct, academic standards (requirements of what students need to know to be able to better achieve training requirements) are supported by systematic elements such as cohort enrollment, industry foundation courses, and after-hours study.</p>
<p>Job Corps academic standards, including applied academic standards, are similar to those developed by state and private educational systems, but unique to Job Corps in that they target exactly what students need to know and be able to achieve academically in order to:</p>
<p>&bull; Master rigorous career technical training programs;<br />&bull; Prepare for advanced training; and<br />&bull; Pass industry certification exams/obtain industry recognized certification.</p>
<p>Capabilities</p>
<p>Job Corps seeks to identify qualified and dedicated institutions of higher education that have implemented experiential learning laboratories; with a focus on standards-based content and instructional delivery for academic, technical, and workforce preparation. This includes programs that support students in applying their knowledge and conceptual understanding to real-world problems or situations utilizing instructor guidance. Job Corps seeks to learn from applicable programs about organizational capacity and experience in the context of operating educational laboratories with a focus on standards-based academic design. Ideally, such programs serve diverse populations of opportunity youth who currently lack paths to success due to social and economic factors, including access to education, work experience, and livable wage jobs.</p>
<p>Due to the large and diverse participant pool, the Job Corps program offers a dynamic research cohort from which to garner data on academic design and effectiveness. It is the intent of Job Corps to identify a/an institution(s) of higher education from which to garner data, draw conclusions, examine and restructure programmatic design, and use knowledge gained to advance the educational and academic efficacy of the program.</p>
<p>All contractors doing business with the Federal Government shall be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database which is located on the System for Award Management website, SAM.gov. The website for registration is http://sam.gov. All active CCR records have migrated to SAM. ALL QUALIFIED SMALL BUSINESSES INCLUDING 8(A) FIRMS ARE ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE.</p>

<p>2. Objective</p>
<p>PEO (U/W), PMA-263 is seeking industry input to identify potential solutions for a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) for use by the United States Marine Corps, capable of providing Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) during day and night operations and in all environmental conditions. The system should be rugged, lightweight and ready to use as delivered with minimal logistic, training and support requirements. The system should provide real-time full motion video via electro-optical and/or infrared sensors. The air vehicles should be capable of autonomous or a safe manual vertical launch with a minimum of support equipment from a small confined area, and should be capable of either a manual or autonomous recovery within the same area as launch. The recovery method should be adequate to prevent system damage and allow for short turn-around times between missions. The ground control station should be man-portable and consist of the necessary equipment to monitor the sensor(s) position and status, control its movement and view its video.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis: 

This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Notice. This is not a Request for Quote (RFQ) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract.
The Department of Veteran Affairs, National Cemetery Administration, is seeking qualified sources to furnish all necessary labor, material, equipment and supervision to perform Preventative Maintenance Service on Potable Water Treatment System at the South Florida National Cemetery located at 6501 S. State Road 7, Lake Worth, FL 33449.
The purpose of this notice is to determine interest and capability of potentially qualified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) and Veteran-Owned Small-Businesses (VOSB) relative to the North American Industry Classification code (NAICS) 221310 Water Supply and Irrigation Systems. The Small Business Size Standard is $27.5 million.

To make an appropriate acquisition decision for this requirement, the Government will use responses to this sources sought synopsis. The type of solicitation issued and the manner of advertisement will also depend on the response to this sources sought synopsis.  

Description:

1.	Provide Preventative Maintenance Service on Potable Water Treatment System to ensure all required performance, operation and compliance standards are maintained.
a.	Provide a Class "C" Certified Operator licensed in the state of Florida to service, operate and maintain a category three (III) water treatment plant.  
b.	Make necessary adjustments to equipment and perform testing to maintain required chlorine dosing level (residual), system pressures and overall performance requirements per applicable permits, laws and regulations.  The operator shall test chlorine residual at most distant location in the water system during every site visit and record results in the maintenance logs.  
c.	Preventative maintenance shall be conducted in strict compliance with Chapter 62-555.305 Florida Administrative Code and the water treatment system Operation & Maintenance Manual. (1) One copy of the plant's manufacturer data and O&M manual will be provided at South Florida VA National Cemetery for the contractor's reference.  The manual shall remain Government property and shall not be removed from the site without written authorization from the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).  The contractor may make copies of the manual at the contractor's expense.
d.	Provide and deliver all required water treatment chemicals to the site and check/fill the chemical feed tanks to appropriate operation levels.  All chemicals used on this system shall be NSF certified.  
e.	If the system must be temporarily shut down to complete preventative maintenance service, the contractor shall provide the COR a minimum 24-hour notice.  Upon completion of maintenance service, the operator shall immediately return the system to full operation then notify the COR that the system is available for use.	
f.	The operator shall make (1) one site visit each month to perform preventative maintenance.
g.	Preventative maintenance shall be in accordance with the following:

2.	How the system works:
a.	Water is pumped from the well via a multi-stage water pump to the pressurized water storage tank. The pump is turned on/off by a pressure switch that operates between 30-50 psi ("cut on" pressure) and 50-70 psi ("cut-off" pressure). A 20 psi differential is recommended by the manufacturer to be between "cut-on" and "cut-off".
b.	Water travels from the pressure tank to the "untreated water meter", and then to the 300 gallon contact tank.
c.	Before the water enters into the contact tank, a chemical feed pump (CFP #1) injects a pre-mixed solution of chlorine/water into the line entering the tank (injection point fitting-IPF#1)) allowing the chlorine to mix with the water for a period of time to achieve proper disinfection. A switch (Flow-Switch #1) on the outlet piping of the contact tank senses water flow exiting the tank and activates the chemical feed pump, turning it "on or off" depending on water flow through the tank.
d.	Upon leaving the contact tank, the water enters the first automatic backwashing filter (Filter AG Filter) where suspended solids & any oxidized iron/hydrogen sulfide is removed.
e.	Next, the filtered water passes through the second automatic backwashing filter (Centaur Carbon Filter) where any residual hydrogen sulfide and/or chlorine is removed.
f.	The "de-chlorinated/filtered" water then passes through a second switch (Flow Switch #2) which activates a second chemical feed pump (CFP #2) that injects a chlorine solution into the treated water (injection point fitting-IPF#2) for "final" disinfection before distribution and use.
g.	The treated water passes through a "finished water meter" and is ready for final use.

3.	Required Water Treatment System Preventative Maintenance:
a.	Test well water before the water treatment equipment to see if water quality has changed from previous month's test results. Variations in water quality might require adjustments with water treatment chemical feed pumps, chlorine solution mixtures, or filter backwashing frequencies.
b.	Inspect chemical solution tanks at each chemical feed pump (CFP#1 & CFP #2) and fill with proper mixture of chlorine (sodium hypochlorite) & clean filtered water when solution level is low. This will need to be done on a monthly basis. Proper mixing ratios have been posted on top of each solution tank by installer at time of installation and start-up. Please refer to these for correct mixture ratio.
c.	Check operation of flow switch (Flow-Switch #1) to be certain it is operating properly. Clean switch if it fails to operate chemical feed pump (CFP #1) properly. Foreign matter will cause switch to stick and not operate properly. Check monthly and keep clean at all times.
d.	Remove and clean injection point fitting (IPF#1). Iron & calcium deposits will build up on fitting over time. Clean monthly, and notify the COR when replacement of injection fitting with new fitting is necessary.
e.	Check operation of flow switch (Flow-Switch #2) to be certain it is operating properly. Clean switch if it fails to operate chemical feed pump (CFP #2) properly. Check monthly and keep clean at all times.
f.	Remove and clean injection point fitting (IPF#2). Calcium deposits will build up on fitting over time. Clean monthly, and notify the COR when replacement of the injection fitting with new fitting is necessary.
g.	Open blow-down valve at bottom of 300 gallon contact tank each month for 2-5 minutes to flush contact tank of any sediment/ iron buildup that has accumulated at bottom tank. Failure to do this will allow excess iron to bleed into the system causing iron staining and possible filtration equipment failure. 
h.	Test treated water at required intervals and document per requirements stated in this contract. Maintain proper chlorine residual in finished water at all times as required by Department of Health regulations.
i.	Check and Clean sediment filter at well head each month.
j.	Carbon Filter Replacement: Each Carbon Filter will need to have media replacement every 2-3 years.   Notify the COR when Carbon media must be replaced.  Actual replacement of carbon media is outside the limits of this contract.

4.	Provide Water Monitoring and Analysis:
a.	Water sampling shall be performed by the certified operator.
b.	Measurements and field testing shall be in accordance with procedures identified in the Department of Environmental Protection Standard Operating Procedures for Field Activities, DEP - SOP 001/01, Rule 62-160.800 and 62-550.550(1), F.A.C.
c.	Water samples shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the Department of Health to perform drinking water analyses.  
d.	Water samples may be taken at any time during the respective quarterly or annual time periods however samples shall not be taken less than (30) thirty days apart.   
e.	If analysis results show that the system has exceeded maximum contaminant levels (MCL) for Nitrates, Nitrites or received a positive result for the bacteriological test the contractor shall notify the Contracting officer and COR immediately, verbally and in writing.
f.	Required Analyses:
i.	(1) Sample Nitrates & Nitrites - Annually
ii.	(2) Samples Microbiological (Finished Water) - Quarterly
iii.	(1) Sample Microbiological (Raw Water at Source) - Quarterly

5.	Provide Documentation & Recordkeeping: 
a.	Operations and Maintenance (O&M) logs shall be maintained at the water treatment plant site at all times.  O&M Logs and laboratory result forms shall be maintained in a bound condition; three ring binder, spiral binder or other method approved by the COR.
b.	O&M logs shall contain the date of site visit, noted deficiencies, list of maintenance items inspected or performed and the license number and printed name of the operator conducting the maintenance/sampling.  The logs shall also contain the date and results of all sampling and water analyses performed.  If results are reported on a laboratory form, the logs shall reference the corresponding laboratory form.  Copies of all Laboratory forms shall be maintained with the O&M logs in an approved binding.
c.	DOH-certified laboratory reporting format shall be per 62-550.730(1) (b) F.A.C.
d.	Monthly and within (10) ten days after each month of system operation, the contractor shall complete a monthly report in addition to the maintenance log entries using Florida Department of Environmental Protection form 62-555.900(3), "Monthly Operation Report for PWS's Treating Raw Ground Water or Purchased Finished Water" and add it to the bound maintenance log book.

<SUBJECT>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND ADVANCED PLANNING BRIEFING TO INDUSTRY AND SOFTWARE SOLARIUM
<SOLNBR>APGAPBI2017
<CONTACT>APG APBI Team, Email usarmy.apg.cecom.mbx.apbi-registration@mail.mil
<DESC>Synopsis: Team Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) anticipates hosting the fifth annual Advanced Planning Briefing to Industry (APBI) on January 30 - February 2, 2017 at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), MD. This year's APBI will be held in conjunction with the second Software Solarium on February 2nd and 3rd. Additional information about the Software Solarium will be forthcoming as an amendment to this announcement. This announcement is meant only as a Save-the-Date at this time as both events are subject to approval and funding.
<p><br />The goal of the APBI is to provide the industrial base with networking opportunities and information on upcoming and long-term potential contracting opportunities for mission areas that focus on: Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Research and Development (R&amp;D); Chemical/Biological Defense (CBD); and APG Garrison. The APBI will discuss potential contracting opportunities that are closely aligned with the technology roadmaps of each respective organization, specifically focusing on Fiscal Years 2017-2019 opportunities in addition to long-range organizational planning. Slides containing this information will be posted electronically immediately preceding the APBI event. The government will not hear formal bids from industry as the purpose of the APBI is only for the government to brief upcoming opportunities to industry.</p>
<p>As the Army strives to provide optimal support and capabilities with limited funds and resources, the ability to receive industry's input and innovation through avenues such as the APBI is crucial. With new technologies rapidly emerging in the commercial environment, this exchange of information will continue to advance solutions, ideas, capabilities and efficiencies. Team APG is aware of the challenges faced by small businesses and has worked to encourage their participation. The agility and innovation small businesses bring to the Army will help shape future development efforts, leverage competition and create new solutions.</p>
<p>The exponential growth of software over the past decade has placed the Army at a strategic crossroads. Virtually every warfighter and business system in use today requires complex software that must be developed or acquired, updated, integrated, and maintained, in quick succession, to support the end user. The software in question may be used to enable a weapon system's capability or provide enterprise functionality to perform worldwide logistics -- in both cases, software has become a key component for Army readiness. This is complicated by the fact that the future software environment is defined by an industry driven move towards primarily software managed weapon systems, infinitely easier to sustain and update than hardware with its associated long, drawn out acquisition processes.</p>
<p>The intent of the Software Solarium is to bring all the leaders and the stakeholders in software together to continue meaningful discussions on the future of software and its challenges.</p>

In an effort to promote a clear understanding of this requirement, the Government is soliciting comments and suggestions from potential Offerors. No proposal is required, and no contract will be awarded as a result of this draft solicitation. Any information provided to the U.S. Government in response to this DRFP is for planning purposes only and will not be used as a selection consideration in any U.S. Government contract competition. Should the U.S. Government elect to pursue the subject requirement, an official Request for Proposal will be released at a later date in accordance with FAR Part 15.<br />&nbsp;
<p>Potential Offerors are invited to submit questions, comments, and suggestions on any aspect of the draft solicitation via email to Jemel M. Hogan at jemel.m.hogan.civ@mail.mil and Jonita L. Joyner at Jonita.l.joyner.civ@mail.mil. All questions, comments and suggestions shall be received not later than 3:00 pm Eastern Standard Time, 31 August 2016.</p>
<p>Changes, as appropriate, to the Government's requirement will be incorporated into any resultant formal solicitation, which will be posted to the FEDBIZOPPS website.</p>
<p>The Army Contracting Command Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Contracting Center, Edgewood Contracting Division, APG, MD, APG-EA Branch, in support of the Joint Project Manager, Nuclear Biological Chemical Contamination Avoidance (JPM NBC CA) is issuing a Draft Request For Proposal (DRFP) in support of the Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD) program. The JPM NBC CA is conducting the NGCD program to fill known operational gaps in chemical detection. NGCD Increment 1 (NGCD1), now named XM12 Aerosol &amp; Vapor Chemical Agent Detector (AVCAD), will detect traditional and advanced threat vapors and liquid and solid aerosols. The AVCAD will detect, identify, alarm, and report the presence of foreign variants of aerosol and vapor chemical hazards by class. The AVCAD will also include a wireless remote alarm capability.</p>
<p>The AVCAD will operate in both dismounted and mounted configurations (a portable system capable of detecting and identifying vapor and aerosol chemical hazards to meet AVCAD requirements). The U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps will use the AVCAD to conduct or support their missions. These missions include monitoring, collective protection, base defense, decontamination, unmasking, dismounted reconnaissance, mounted reconnaissance (on the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV)), shipboard (replacing the current shipboard chemical detection system), and aviation (CH-47 Chinook, OH-60 Blackhawk, and CH-72 platforms for surveillance and survey of cargo and personnel). The objective of this effort is to procure XM12 AVCADs for EMD. The contract requirements for the XM12 AVCADs include EMD Government testing, program and logistic support, and delivery of technical data (end-item products, software, and logistics).</p>

<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;<br />(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;<br />(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;<br />(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;<br />(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>Background<br />In order to pursue its goal of miniaturization, reduced assembly time, and improved quality, the Electric Field Laboratory at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center is in need of a surface mount technology (SMT) automatic pick and place (PnP) machine for the assembly of both prototype and flight boards.
<p>Objectives <br />The goal of the Laboratory is to enhance the in-house assembly of printed circuit boards.  Currently most of the assembly work is done manually which can take several weeks for very dense boards.  Some of the work is outsourced which increases the lead times.  By having a SMT automatic PnP machine, assembly time is reduced from weeks to hours, all the assembly work is kept in-house reducing lead times, miniaturization is possible, and quality control is improved.</p>
<p>Requirements<br />The Electric Field Laboratory requirements for a SMT automatic pick and place machine are the following:<br />&bull;	It is desired the machine be a benchtop unit but a standalone unit no more than 6' by 4' footprint is acceptable.<br />&bull;	The machine shall accommodate board sizes from 2" by 2" to 10" by 15".<br />&bull;	The machine shall place 0201, 0402, 0603, 0805, and 1206 components.<br />&bull;	The machine shall place 8-16 pin SOIC packages.<br />&bull;	The machine shall place 8-16 pin MSOP packages.<br />&bull;	The machine shall place 0.5mm pitch quad flat packs.<br />&bull;	The machine shall be able to be fed, at a minimum, loose components, cut tape, 8mm reels, 12mm reels, and tubes.<br />&bull;	The machine shall dispense solder paste.<br />&bull;	The machine shall place at least 2000 components per hour.<br />&bull;	The machine shall accept a position file in text, csv, or excel format.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation is No. 10935602 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The RFQ will result in a firm fixed price contract. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 722320 - Caterer. Small business size standard is $7,500,000.00. This acquisition is 100% Set-Aside for Small Business. Third party quotes will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Description of Requirement:</p>
<p>SEE ATTACHED PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT</p>
<p>Date of Performance: 3 December 2016</p>
<p>Requirements for Your Quote:<br />Please submit a quote on your company letterhead showing a price per contract line item (CLIN 0001) with total price. Include the following information on your quote: Cage code, Tax ID number, company name, phone number, contact, and email. The award will only be made to an offeror that is all-inclusive of the requirements on this solicitation.</p>

<p><br />Provision for Evaluation: Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror that meets the minimum standards for the items specified, and is determined responsible in accordance with FAR Part 9.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotes/offers and make award without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial quote/offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price standpoint. Do not assume you will have the opportunity to clarify, discuss or revise your quote/offer. Offerors may, at the discretion of the Government, be asked to provide more information and clarification regarding their offer/quote. Request for such information does not constitute discussions. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government intends to make a single, Firm-Fixed Price award. <br />Any response to this synopsis/solicitation will be considered a "quotation".</p>
<p>"Offer" means a response to a solicitation that, if accepted, would bind the offeror to perform the resultant contract. Responses to invitations for bids (sealed bidding) are offers called "bids" or "sealed bids"; responses to requests for proposals (negotiation) are offers called "proposals"; however, responses to requests for quotations (simplified acquisition) are "quotations," not offers.</p>
<p>Quotes are due November 7, 2016, 2:00 PM Pacific. Oral quotations will not be accepted. Faxed offers must be readable to be considered. Fax offers to (503) 584-3771 attn: Andrea Smothers.

Email offers to andrea.k.smothers.mil@mail.mil.</p>
<p>FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations</p>
<p>(a) A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.</p>
<p>(b) When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing, as defined at 2.101. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.</p>
<p>(c) If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. (See 13.302-4 for procedures on termination or cancellation of purchase orders.)</p>
<p>Exchanges of Information</p>
<p>FAR 15.201(f) General information about agency mission needs and future requirements may be disclosed at any time. After release of the solicitation, the contracting officer MUST be the focal point of any exchange with potential offerors. When specific information about a proposed acquisition that would be necessary for the preparation of proposals is disclosed to one or more potential offerors, that information must be made available to the public as soon as practicable, but no later than the next general release of information, in order to avoid creating an unfair competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Terms and Conditions:<br />Offerors must be actively registered on the Systems for Award Management database (SAM). Information concerning SAM requirements may be viewed via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ or by calling the SAM Registration Center at 866-606-8220. Only contractors who are registered in the Systems for Award Management (SAM) can be awarded a contract. Offerors must have electronic funds transfer (EFT) capability. Offerors' proposals shall be valid for a minimum of 30 days to be acknowledged in the offerors' proposal. Contractors must be actively registered with Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) at http://wawf.eb.mil. Clauses may be accessed electronically in full text through http://farsite.hill.af.mil</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers as of October 12th.  1)      Design building RFPs typically require conceptual layout of fire alarm devices, which appear to be required as part of this RFP.  Will architectural backgrounds be provided so that RFP drawings can be provided or will the contractor be responsible for developing Architectural backgrounds?  A: The contractor will be responsible for developing architectural backgrounds.  2)      There is no mention of a Mass Notification System.  Confirm that MNS is not a part of this scope.  A: If the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) requirements are triggered then a Mass Notification System (MNS) will be required.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------- Questions and Answers as of October 5th.  Q1.  Please clarify project name and RFQ number since there are differences in the posted information:     E commerce Title is Fire Protection Systems Study, # N66001-17-R-0009     E commerce description refers to # N66001-T-0009     SOW Title is Fire Alarm Systems Study, # N66001-17-R-0017 A: The e-Commerce description, as well as the SOW title, is a typo and the description is updated to reflect N66001-17-R-0009.  Q2.  Please provide the size in square feet of each building involved. A: The square footage of each building is: Bldg 600: 123,789 Bldg. 40: 89,436 Bldg. 111: 53,401 Bldg. 1: 180,768  Q3.

<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>

<p>The Army Contracting Command Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Contracting Center, Edgewood Contracting Division, APG, MD, APG-EA Branch, in support of the Joint Project Manager, Nuclear Biological Chemical Contamination Avoidance (JPM NBC CA) is issuing a Draft Request For Proposal (DRFP) in support of the Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD) program. The JPM NBC CA is conducting the NGCD program to fill known operational gaps in chemical detection. NGCD Increment 1 (NGCD1), now named XM12 Aerosol &amp; Vapor Chemical Agent Detector (AVCAD), will detect traditional and advanced threat vapors and liquid and solid aerosols. The AVCAD will detect, identify, alarm, and report the presence of foreign variants of aerosol and vapor chemical hazards by class. The AVCAD will also include a wireless remote alarm capability.</p>
<p>The AVCAD will operate in both dismounted and mounted configurations (a portable system capable of detecting and identifying vapor and aerosol chemical hazards to meet AVCAD requirements). The U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps will use the AVCAD to conduct or support their missions. These missions include monitoring, collective protection, base defense, decontamination, unmasking, dismounted reconnaissance, mounted reconnaissance (on the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV)), shipboard (replacing the current shipboard chemical detection system), and aviation (CH-47 Chinook, OH-60 Blackhawk, and CH-72 platforms for surveillance and survey of cargo and personnel).

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS ISSUED IN SUPPORT OF MARKET RESEARCH, TO GATHER INFORMATION, AND TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SOURCES.
<p><br />A. STATEMENT OF NEED</p>
<p>As further described below, the U.S. Army Contracting Command-Redstone Arsenal (ACC-RSA) is interested in Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) contract support services in support of the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (RTS), to include (but not limited to) the operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of sensors and systems, mission data collection, support to customers for missile and system testing, and space surveillance and object identification for the Warfighter. Additionally, contract support services are required to support activities at a control center in Huntsville, AL, known as the RTS Operations Center-Huntsville (ROC-H).</p>
<p>B. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>RTS</p>
<p>The RTS is an approved DoD Major Range and Test Facilities Base (MRTFB) that supports approved Department of Defense Military Service, Joint Forces, and commercial tests. As a MRTFB, RTS services primarily focus on Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts.</p>
<p>RTS is a tenant organization on the U.S. Army Garrison - Kwajalein Atoll (USAG-KA), which is managed by the U.S. Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM). The U.S. Army leases 11 islands within Kwajalein Atoll from the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) under a Military Use and Operating Rights Agreement (MUORA); the MUORA is part of the Compact of Free Association between the US and the RMI. RTS equipment, instrumentation and facilities are located on 8 of these 11 leased islands. Kwajalein Island and Roi Namur Island require 24 hour, 7 days a week contractor support of RTS mission operations. During test operations the RTSoperational area expands to encompass an area witha radius of 500 nautical miles of both KwajaleinIsland and Wake Island. Mission operations include radar, optics, telemetry, command and control, launch ordnance, calibration, voice and data communications, data collection/distribution, data reduction, and information services including intercontinental communications. Note that many of these capabilities are one of a kind in boththeir function and employment, and include both O&amp;M and Improvement and Modernization (I&amp;M).<br />RTSconducts mission operations in a split base configuration with data collection sensors and the secondary operations control center (KMCC - Kwajalein Mission Control Center) on the Kwajalein Atoll and the main operations control center at ROC-H.</p>
<p>Location/Demographics</p>
<p>Kwajalein Atoll is approximately 2,100 nautical miles west-southwest of Hawaii; it is a crescent loop of coral islands enclosing the world's largest lagoon (1,100 square miles). The atoll is 75 miles from Kwajalein Island (on the south reef) to Ebadon Island (northwest corner) and 15 miles west/east (at the widest point). Kwajalein Island is home to approximately 1,500 people and its population is a mix of DoD active duty (AD) personnel, Department of Army civilian (DAC) employees, and DoD contractor personnel and their family members. Roi-Namur Island is 50 miles north of Kwajalein Island and is home to approximately100 unaccompanied DoD contractor personnel. Meck Island is 20 miles north of Kwajalein Island, has no permanent residents, and is used primarily during missions as a launch site. Ebeye Island is 5 miles north of Kwajalein Island and is home to approximately 15,000 local nationals. Wake Island, which is approximately 700 miles north of Kwajalein Atoll, is utilized by RTS test customers and is supported during test activities on a campaign basis.</p>
<p>Travel</p>
<p>RTSis a remote location with limited travel options. Currently, only the U.S. Air Force Air Mobility Command and United Airlines service Kwajalein Atoll (both options require travel through Hawaii). The minimum travel time from the Continental United States (CONUS) is two days. Of note, the remote location increases the transportation costs and lengthens supply chain operations.</p>
<p>Corrosive Environment</p>
<p>Kwajalein Atoll is one of the most highly corrosive environments in the world. The salt content of the ocean and salt spray causes most metals (including stainless steel) to begin to oxidize within a matter of weeks. This environment results in a significant cost consideration as equipment refreshment rate and maintenance costs are substantial.</p>
<p>Host Nation Infrastructure</p>
<p>The RMI is a developing nation. The neighboring islands do not have adequate infrastructure to support the population currently residing on Kwajalein Island. Local and third country nationals reside on Ebeye Island and must transit through Kwajalein Island to reach the international flights operated by United Airlines. This island has a struggling infrastructure due to the dense population (.125 square miles or 80 acres in size; 5th most densely populated island in the world). Due to the limited infrastructure, USAG-KA houses and/or hosts all AD, DAC, and DoD contractor personnel, as well as selected local national personnel.<br />C.

<p><br />Both the RRC services for in-house RRC beds and the Home Confinement services for home confinement placements shall be in accordance with the Federal Bureau of Prisons Statement of Work entitled, "Residential Reentry Center, August 2007; Revision 01 December 2007 CCB; Revision 02, December 2008, CCB, Revision 03, February 2010 CCB, Revision 04, May 2010 CCB, Revision 05, May 2011, CCB; Revision 06, January 2012, RRMB; Revision 07, February 2012, RRMB; Revision 08, January 2013 RRMB". Home Confinement services (for home confinement placements) are specifically defined in chapter 10, programs, of the aforementioned SOW. Additional requirements for these services are referenced throughout the SOW as well. <br />This will be for (an) indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type contract(s) with firm fixed unit prices for Line Item 1 and Line Item 2.</p>
<p>The RRC requirement will be for a guaranteed minimum of eleven (11) in-house male inmate days with an estimated maximum of twenty-two (22) in-house male inmate days, and a guaranteed minimum of one (1) in-house female inmate day with an estimated maximum of three (3) in-house female inmate days for the one-year Base Period; and for a guaranteed minimum of eleven (11) in-house male inmate days with an estimated maximum of twenty-two (22) in-house male inmate days, and a guaranteed minimum of one (1) in-house female inmate day with an estimated maximum of three (3) in-house female inmate days for each of the four one-year option periods thereafter, if any options are exercised.</p>
<p>The Home Confinement requirement will be for a guaranteed minimum of four (4) male placements onto home confinement with an estimated maximum of eight (8) male placements onto home confinement, and a guaranteed minimum of one (1) female placement onto home confinement with an estimated maximum of two (2) female placements onto home confinement for the one-year Base Period; and for a guaranteed minimum of four (4) male placements onto home confinement with an estimated maximum of eight (8) male placements onto home confinement, and a guaranteed minimum of one (1) female placement onto home confinement with an estimated maximum of two (2) female placements onto home confinement for each of the four one-year option periods thereafter, if any options are exercised.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the Government to award both line items (RRC in-house beds and home confinement placements) to a single provider, as these services are interconnected and rely upon each other to ensure adequate programming and case management of offenders. The Government reserves the right to potentially make an award which is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>RFP-200-1265-ES will be available on or about September 26, 2014, and it will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be available. The site provides downloading instructions. Future information about this acquisition will also be distributed through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The estimated closing date of RFP-200-1265-ES will be on or about November 25, 2014.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by this agency. No collect calls will be accepted. No telephone request or written requests for the solicitation will be accepted.</p>
<p>Faith-Based and Community Organizations can submit offers/bids/quotations equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible.</p>

<DESC>The following language is added to this Sources Sought.&nbsp; It is important to note that for a vendor to be eligible to&nbsp;receive an award&nbsp;to a&nbsp;possible solicitation, the vendor has to have completed the Navy DIACAP (Department of Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process) and be authorized to operate on Navy networks prior to closing of the possible&nbsp;solicitation.&nbsp;Additionally, the Navy requires that all new vendors and/or products also have to go through Risk Management Framework (RMF).<br /><br />Note: The time it takes for an application for DIACAP accreditation depends on complexity. The times vary from 6 to 18 months. Additionally, there is cost associated&nbsp;to apply&nbsp;for accreditation that varies depending on the complexity.&nbsp; The estimated cost for this effort is $30,000 to $35,000.&nbsp; If DLA does post a solicitation, DLA anticipates posting the solicitation between 1 to&nbsp;2 months after this Sources Sought closes.<br /><br />DLA is still encouraging vendors to provide alternate sources regardless of DIACAP accreditation as future customers may or may not&nbsp;have this as a requirement.&nbsp;DLA is also encouraging vendors to&nbsp;seek DIACAP accreditation so that alternate sources could be more readily available for&nbsp;future solicitations that require this accreditation. If a vendor has a Navy DIACAP accreditation and a completed Risk Management Framework or anticipates having these in the next&nbsp;3 months,&nbsp;please provide a statement with your alternate source to be considered for the possible solicitation to follow this Sources Sought Notice.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 1 - MARKET SURVEY ANNOUNCEMENT for the eLearning Management System (eLMS) Support

The purpose of Amendment 0002 to the Market Survey is to provide the Government response for Inquiries received for the Market Survey.  All other information remains unchanged.  The Government response to inquiries is provided as an attachment. No additional public inquiries will be accepted for this Market Survey.  The Market Survey closing date is unchanged.


1. Introduction/Purpose
This market survey is conducted to determine whether adequate competition exists, or whether to set-aside competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

2.Scope:
The FAA learning community has a requirement for a framework that provides enterprise-wide support for applications and services to meet training and development goals.  The Leadership Development division within the FAAs Office of Human Resources is responsible for maintaining the applications, development activities, and support services within this framework.  The Vendor will provide on-site and virtual services to support the FAA Learning Enterprise Architecture. The Vendor will provide Tier 1 and Tier 2 help desk support for SuccessFactors and for FAA Blackboard Learn.

3. Background:
One of the key drivers for change within the FAA has been the advent of a centralized eLearning Management System (eLMS).  With the complexity of the FAA training infrastructure, eLMS alone cannot achieve the tenets of the FAAs Destination 2025 as well as to supplant all training systems that have been identified across the FAA.  The goal of the FAA Learning Enterprise Architecture (LEA) is to design an infrastructure that both serves the full needs of the FAA training community while also meeting the demands of system consolidation.  In addition, the efforts of the LEA also represent the intersection between the FAA training community and the FAA Chief Information Officer (CIO) efforts.

The LEA will serve as the critical link between how the FAA manages its employee development and how the FAA achieves the tenets of the Destination 2025.  

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from sources that can provide the services as described in the attached SOW.  Responses to this market survey will be used to finalize the FAA's acquisition strategy for the requirement.  The vendor selected will provide the services, in accordance with the attached SOW, for the planned period of performance of five years from the date of award.  The award structure will include a 12 month base period with four 12 month option periods. See the attached SOW for details on the work to be performed.

<DESC>Amendment 0004 10/12/2016:  Attach corrected Past Performance Questionnaire, Rev 1.



Amendment 0003 9/26/2016:  Remove Total Set Aside from SIR and change to Full and Open Competition.  The Closing Date is hereby extended till 10/14/2016 at 3:00 p.m CST.  


Amendment 0002 9/16/2016:  Submitted Questions and Answers - 

1)   can you tell me where this solicitation states Reciprocating Dual and Turbine Dual does this refer to Dual or two engines? 

Answer:  The term DUAL means flight with an instructor as in dual instructional flight.



Amendment 0001 9/13/2016:  Submitted Questions and Answers - 

1)  Part I - Section B:  Item 0001 - Is this course expected to meet the requirements for an add-on Commercial Helicopter Rating?

Answer: Yes  

And, what is the purpose of training hours in both recip and turbine helicopters? 

Answer:  The FAA wants their inspectors to be exposed to both types of helicopters and the differences between them.

2)  Part I - Section B:  Items 0003 and 0004 - Both of these Instructor ratings could be accomplished easily and with less expense in a reciprocating engine helicopter.  Why does the Add-on CFI specify reciprocating dual and the CFI-Instrument specify turbine dual?

Answer:  We need our inspector work force to be proficient in both types of helicopters in case after training they have to perform a flight test in either type of helicopter. 

3)  Part I - Section B:  Item 0005 - ATP Helicopter Pilot Certification Course.... The proposed amount of time for this course seems excessive considering the student (inspector) would already have to hold an Instrument Helicopter Rating prior to enrollment in this course.  Please explain the need for the requested 25 hours of Turbine Dual and 40 hours of ground instruction to achieve ATP certification

Answer:  Our Inspectors do not fly on a regular basis so the idea of the additional hours is for increased proficiency prior to a flight check. Additionally, they do not have the time to devote to pre-study prior to training, so the ground school hours allow for increased hours of study to obtain the requested rating. There may be a significant gap between when our inspector obtained the Instrument Helicopter Rating and the assignment to obtain the ATP certification. Again the increased hours are due to the lack of pre-course study time and flight proficiency.



The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement for Helicopter Pilot Training for employee's of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  The FAA contemplates award of an Indefinite Delivery/Requirements type contract with 1-year base period with two, 1-year option periods.

<DESC><p>This is Modification 5 to the synopsis entitled "Facilities Contract", Solicitation No. NNJ16588264L, which was posted on May 26, 2016.</p>
<p>You are notified that a typographical error has been corrected from Modification 4.</p>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) is planning to re-compete the Facilities Support Services Contract (FSSC), NNJ08JA02C. This future requirement will constitute the Facilities Contract (FC). This synopsis is a Request for Information (RFI) to solicit comments from industry for acquisition strategies, contract type, streamlining and efficiency achievements, suggestions on bundling of requirements, and for any other technical, business or contractual issues that should be considered by the Government on these future requirements from qualified companies. Industry is invited to provide feedback on the specific areas below. Products and services provided by this contract are required for facility operations and support. <br />The FSSC provides critical support to NASA JSC by providing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Facility Maintenance and Repair Services<br />-General Facility Operations and Management<br />-Engineering and Construction Projects<br />-Information Technology Management and Support<br />-Wildlife Management<br />-Environmental Support<br />-Rigging Support</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current FSSC contract is a Cost Plus Award Term/Award Fee (CPAT/AF) contract. The majority of work is covered under the base contract; however, there is an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) component for discrete tasks within the general scope of the contract. It is anticipated that the FC will be similar to the current FSSC. The current FC draft Statement of Work (SOW) and other pertinent documents are located at the procurement website: http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/fac.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the FSSC is 561210, Facilities Support Services, with a size standard of $38.5 Million. It is anticipated that the NAICS code and size standard will be the same for the FC. "Facilities Support Services" requires the performance of three or more separate activities in the areas of services or specialty trade contractors industries. If services are performed, these service activities must each be in a separate NAICS industry. If the procurement requires the use of specialty trade contractors (plumbing, painting, plastering, carpentry, etc.), all such specialty trade contractors activities are considered a single activity and classified as "Building and Property Specialty Trade Services." Since "Building and Property Specialty Trade Services" is only one activity, two additional activities of separate NAICS industries are required for a procurement to be classified as "Facilities Support Services." The requirements of the FC are not considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product. A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Industry is invited to review the questions listed below and provide feedback on the specific areas requested. The information received will not be released in its submitted form, but may be used in developing the best approach for follow-on strategies, and therefore may be recognizable to the interested party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What changes from the current FSSC contracting approach (contract type, period of performance, etc.), if any, would you suggest for the follow-on FC and why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Provide feedback regarding incentive arrangements. For instance, how should risks versus rewards be shared by the Government and contractor? What types of incentives would you consider to be most effective to encourage the contractor to perform high quality work at a reasonable price?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Identify barriers to competition that could be mitigated to foster a more competitive environment for this procurement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Recommend process improvements and efficiencies, both in the acquisition phase and the performance phase, along with identification of non-value-added steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Discuss ways in which NASA could design/structure this procurement to maximize synergy between the labor skills needed for employees across the contract, and how to best cross-utilize the workforce. Discuss all alternatives you would like NASA to consider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Discuss ways in which NASA could design/structure this procurement to maximize safety, cost control, and system availability while performing maintenance and sustaining engineering on systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Identify any areas of the FC draft SOW that you believe could be performed by a small business and provide rationale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Identify any areas of the FC draft SOW and/or Data Requirements Descriptions (DRDs) that could be eliminated/modified to reduce the price of the contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Identify any areas of the FC draft SOW and/or Data Requirements Descriptions (DRDs) that need additional clarification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Contract Transition: Suggest ideas for executing a transition from the current FSSC to the follow-on FC while ensuring continuity of operations. How long should the transition period be?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are requested to provide electronic responses to the questions above. The total page count is limited to 20 pages for questions 1 through 10 using no less than 12 point Times New Roman font. Please send all responses via e-mail to dominic.j.golemi@nasa.gov. Your response is requested no later than 5:00 p.m. Central Standard Time (CST) on October 28, 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government intends to review the responses submitted, but will not respond to individual submissions. NASA reserves the right to share all information received in response to this RFI with any NASA civil servants, and to use all information submitted in response to this RFI in developing a future acquisition strategy. This data will not be shared outside the Government nor released in its submitted form. Confidential, proprietary, competition sensitive, or business information should not be submitted in response to this RFI. Such information will not be reviewed and will be deleted. Any communications in reference to this RFI shall cite the RFI number in the subject line and be directed to the point of contact identified above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI. The Government will not pay for any information solicited. No evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the LC anticipates adding Export Control Support Services and Bicycle Program Management and Maintenance as requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current LOC contract is a Cost Plus Award Term/Award Fee (CPAT/AF) contract.

<DESC>Request for Information 
Security Labeling Service
TAC Number:  TAC-17-38415

This is a request for information (RFI) only.  Do not submit a TEP.  It is requested that all contractors interested in participating in this effort please note their interest and provide indication of their respective capabilities to perform the effort described in attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).   

This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered an Invitation for Bid, Request for Task Execution Plan, Request for Quotation or a Request for Proposal.  Additionally, there is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services described in this RFI.  Your response to this RFI will be treated only as information for the Government to consider.  You will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this RFI.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated or received for this effort.  The information provided may be used by the VA in developing its acquisition strategy and PWS.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.

Be advised that set-aside decisions may be made based on the information provided in response to this RFI.  Responses should be as complete and informative as possible.

Background
Veterans Health Administration has a need for an HL7 conformant security labeling as a service to support its health care mission. The SLS would include the capability to automatically label health care information so as to distinguish those Veterans who have 38 USC 7332 protected conditions from those that do not. This service would facilitate information sharing by eliminating the need to require authorizations for the majority population who do not actually have 38 USC 7332 protected conditions prior to a disclosure.
  
The scope of work is principally described as an HL7 conformant security labeling service that accepts VA provided healthcare information as input, leverages contractor managed rule-based heuristics to apply all applicable VA identified Laws, Regulations and Policies including HL7 conformant labels to each information element and section up to and including overall high-water mark, and which then returns the final labeled information as output.  

In addition, the scope of work includes ongoing self-evaluation and quality reporting, manual review for indeterminate cases, and a continuing process of adaptation as information codes and classification rules evolve.

The scope of work is more fully described in the accompanying PWS.

Be advised that set-aside decisions may be made based on the information provided in response to this RFI.  Responses should be as complete and informative as possible.
It is requested that the T4NG prime contractors respond to the following questions:

a.	Provide a summary of your technical capability to meet the requirements.  
The page limit for responses is 15 pages.

Small businesses should also include information as to:

1)	the intent and ability to meet set-aside requirements for performance of this effort, if applicable
2)	information as to available personnel and financial resources
3)	Information as to proposed team members, the percentage of work each is to perform and which PWS requirements are planned to be subcontracted
4)	SDVOSBs must indicate whether at least 50% of the cost of labor is planned to be expended for prime employees or employees of other eligible SDVOSB firms. This should also include the prime planned percentage and if under 50%, the names of the potential team members that may be used to fulfill the 50% SDVOSB requirement. 

Technical Approach

1.	Provide a summary of your technical approach to meet the requirements set forth in the PWS including the solution architecture and integration into VA operations.
2.	Does your solution have varying levels of service (add on features) not covered in the PWS?  If so please elaborate.

Performance

3.	Please provide your expected minimum, maximum and average round trip time to label a document based on the volumes identified in the PWS. Please state any assumptions made (e.g. size and type of documents.)
4.	Do you currently measure these metrics? 
5.	Please provide your expectations for the rate of false positives and false negatives. Please describe your methods for measuring these rates. What are your minimum standards for false negative rates and false positive rates? 

Labeling Service

6.	Describe the service capabilities addressing the ability to redefine sensitivity rules, the ability to process and methods for identify, processing and disposing of documents that cannot be labeled.

7.	Does your solution fully support these document types?




Document Type	Currently Supported	Planned Support	Not Supported
C-CDA V1.1 Continuity of Care Document	?	?	?
C-CDA V1.1 Consultation Notes	?	?	?
C-CDA V1.1 Discharge Summary	?	?	?
C-CDA V1.1 Imaging Integration, and DICOM Diagnostic Imaging Reports	?	?	?
C-CDA V1.1 History and Physical	?	?	?
C-CDA V1.1 Operative Note	?	?	?
C-CDA V1.1 Progress Note	?	?	?
C-CDA V1.1 Procedure Note	?	?	?
C-CDA V1.1 Unstructured Documents	?	?	?
HITSP C32	?	?	?
HITSP C62	?	?	?
C-CDA V.20 Documents	?	?	?

8.	Describe how your solution identifies protected conditions in unstructured data fields (e.g., free text) include how it is superior to other approaches.

9.	Please provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for the service described in the PWS. If available, please provide details for license fees, usage costs, and maintenance and support costs.

10.	Has the draft PWS provided sufficient detail to describe the technical and functional requirements that encompass the desired solution?
______ YES _______ NO (if No, answer 11)

11.	If "NO", please provide positive or negative feedback regarding the PWS, such as recommended changes, noted exceptions, and ambiguities on elements of the draft PWS  that may contribute to a more accurate proposal submission and efficient, cost effective solution. 
 
Electronic responses preferred.

<AWARDEE>Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, 6720-A Rockledge Dr. STE 100, Bethesda, MD 20817-1891 US
<DESC>10 USC 2113 authorizes USU to enter into a sole source contract with the Henry Jackson Foundation (HJF) or any other non-profit entity for the purpose of medical education or research.  The current electronic security system is not compliant with DOD requirements and puts USU research and educational activities at risk. The existing ESS is running to fail. Cameras, monitors and access control features are in a state of failure. The system is beyond repair and surpassed its lifecycle resulting in a system with nothing that is salvageable. The result is an entire hardware/software upgrade that will along with regular maintenance provide a system with potential future growth for the next 10 years. The current university cabling infrastructure has limited fiber optic cabling and cannot spare any of their fibers to create a single connection for a required dedicated security network to support the new ESS. The result with this is a new cable infrastructure needing to be installed to support a new ESS. The current location that houses the security monitoring equipment is out of date and conflicts with Federal guidelines and industry best practices that require a Security equipment room and command center to be at a minimum of 50 feet from high risk areas, outer most external walls including building entrances. The result in this is, relocating the security equipment room and command security center to a new location within the university.<br /><br />
<p>Below is a list of some of the current Federal regulations, DOD Instructions and NavSec Regulations that govern the university ESS requirements:<br /><br />a)	DOD 5200.08-R, "Physical Security Program", April 9, 2007<br />b)	DODI 2000.12, "DOD Antiterrorism (AT) Program", March 1, 2012<br />c)	DODI 2000.16, "DOD Antiterrorism (AT) Standards", October 2, 2016<br />d)	DODI 33224.03, "Physical Security Equipment (PSE) Research , Development, Test, Evaluation (RDT&amp;E)," October 1, 2007<br />e)	DTM 09-012, "Interim Policy Guidance for DOD Physical Access Control", December 8, 2009<br />f)	OPNAV 5530.14E CH-2,"Navy Physical Security and Law Enforcement Program<br />g)	DODI 100.13 "Identification (ID) Cards for Members of the Uniform Services , their<br />Dependents, and other Eligible Individuals", January 23, 2014<br />h)	Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12,"Policy for Common Identification<br />Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors", August 27, 2004<br />i)	Federal information Processing Standard Publication 201-2, "Personal Identity<br />Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors," August 2013<br />j)	NIST SP 800-116 "PIV in Physical Access Control Systems (PACS)", November 2008<br />k)	UFC 4-010-01 "DOD Minimum Antiterrorism Standard for Building, with Change 1",<br />February 9, 2012<br />l)	UFC 4-021-02 "Electronic Security Systems", October 01, 2013<br />m)	UFC 4-022-02 "Selection and Application of Vehicle Barrier, with Change 1", June 8, 2009</p>
<p>Multiple efforts with NAVFAC, Navy N6 and the Army Corp of Engineers over the past years have produced a detailed budget and statement of work, but were unable to result in contract award. HJF has considerable construction experience and a Facilities Manager who is willing to take over the responsibility for the installation of the new ESS. This would enable the university to most quickly correct its security deficiency and the foundation is expected to offer a fee that is considerably lower than what is charged by DOD construction offices.<br /><br />Thus, because a sole source award to HJF is a sound business decision and authorized by FAR 6.302-5 (Authorized or required by statue) the CO and the Competition Advocate have signed the Sole Source Justification and it may be viewed here as an attachment.</p>

Historic Preservation Services
Maui State Veterans Cemetery
NCA State Grants Program

The Depart of Veterans Affairs, National Cemetery Administration, requires the services of a professional historic preservation consultant to facilitate ongoing Section 106 consultation regarding a project to expand the Maui State Veterans Cemetery.  Consultant should meet the Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualifications as explained by the National Park Service https://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/arch_stnds_1.htm.  In addition, consultant must have experience working with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) and State Historic Preservation Offices (SHPOs), Tribal Historic Preservation Offices (THPOs) and Native Hawaiian Organizations.  Consultant should provide 4 examples of successfully completed projects demonstrating mitigation of complicated and sensitive issues involving Traditional Cultural Places.

The consultant's role will be to facilitate and oversee the Section 106 consultation process with the goal of completing a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and obtaining signatures from consulting parties. The tasks for completion include drafting letters for NCA, organizing public meetings, ensuring email invitations for consultation are sent to all parties in a timely manner, ensuring all parties receive notice of meetings, compiling notes of meetings for the administrative record, ensuring Native Hawaiian Organizations are contacted and included if they so desire, facilitating the meetings including developing the agenda and adherence to it, and writing the revised MOA as parties may agree to it. The consultation process will culminate with the development of the MOA addressing the adverse effects on the historic property and will conclude with the final signed copy of the MOA being distributed to all parties.

Follow-up with the consulting parties may be required after the MOA is signed to insure the stipulations are being implemented as agreed upon in the document.  The consultant will monitor the project during the construction phase to ensure NCA adheres to the stipulations of the MOA.
