Previously collected stool samples on the participants would also be tested for shedding of vaccine. These saliva results would then be analyzed to determine if there is correlation with HBGA phenotype/genotype, the stool vaccine shedding results and the previously measured serum antibody response to the G1P (8) rotavirus vaccine that the children had received.

(i) Contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties who believe they possess the capabilities to satisfy this requirement should submit a Capability Statement demonstrating their abilities to meet this requirement. All responses will be considered. All Capability Statements shall be received by the closing date of this synopsis and shall be submitted in writing. Responses may be sent via email to luw9@cdc.gov.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the
Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the
authority of FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources may identify their interest
and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals, quotations or
capability statements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive
proposals. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is
issued under an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) after date of
publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A
determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based
upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of
determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Based upon market
research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12,
Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies
or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer
their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a
commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The Contracting Officer may
utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions
under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offeror's
proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else
having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous,
meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors
(although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will
be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By
submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to
participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly
disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's
final auction price will be considered its final price proposal revision. No
price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless
the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final
proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to award a single firm-fixed-price contract to Schneider Electric, Inc. for technical support, preventative on-site maintenance, and remote diagnostic support for the Schneider Electric PowerLogic Monitoring System at SSA?s Headquarters Complex and National Computer Center (NCC) in Woodlawn, MD. A sole source procurement is authorized in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) based on the fact that no other company can supply parts, labor, software, and expertise to maintain, support, and repair this system, as the PowerLogic System is proprietary to Schneider Electric, Inc. All work performed on the PowerLogic System must be completed by a qualified senior technical support engineer, certified by Schneider Electric, Inc.
This is a notice of intent, and, as such, is for informational purposes only. This is not a request for competitive quotations. No solicitation document is available. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract action (based upon otherwise receiving any responses to this notice) is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This procurement is for 6 integrated data acquisition systems for accurately logging two 32Hz ultrasonic anemometer data and sonic temperature that provides optional data ports for additional sensor observations. The system requires an integrated power supply and with solar recharging. In addition, self-contained 6.1m tall tripods are required with guide wires for stability such that we can deploy this on the beach without installing large stakes or concrete base. It is necessary for these systems to use a common data system for time-synchronization to ensure that the same volume of air is measured at a given time. Other requirements include low power consumption and relatively small in size, as this system will be used for research in locations with no access to external power and where set-up, data retrieval and relocation needs to be performed by no more than two people.
