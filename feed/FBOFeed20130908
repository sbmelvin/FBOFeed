<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NCEZID, 3150 Rampart Road, Fort Collins, CO 80521, hereby announces its intent to issue a sole source contract to University of California, San Francisco, 513 Parnassus Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94143 to provide serum samples and culture isolates from B. henselae and B. quintana infected patients.
<p>NAICS Code: 611310</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). We are looking to acquire well-characterized archived reference samples (serum samples, serial and individual, low passage isolates and multiple strain genotypes) from patients diagnosed with B. henselae and B. quintana infections. We require both B. henselae and B. quintana positive patient samples as all patient serum samples submitted for Bartonella diagnostic testing in the U.S. are tested against both B. henselae and B. quintana.</p>
<p>In order to have well-characterized samples, they must be obtained from an institution with a clinician having established B. henselae and B. quintana clinical experience including diagnosing and differntiating both B. henselae and B. quintana in humans as well as expertise in laboratory testing and archiving of clinical samples. We have identified a clinician on staff at the University of California with the required archived samples and expertise published in the National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health PubMed index. This clinican has the required expertise in both B. henselae and B. quintana infections as well as existing laboratory testing results and clinical data for these specimens that we require.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 2 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Please forward the capability statement and/or pricing information to Tonya S. Justice, Contract Specialist, Reference 200-2013-M-56629, Centers for Disease Control, Procurement and Grants Office, 2877 Brandywine Road, Atlanta, Ste. 1801, Atlanta, GA 30341. All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for these services in the future.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 2 days, negotiations will be conducted with the University of California, San Francisco, as the only source and a contract will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

Additionally, as the project site is located along a highly-visible primary JBLM thoroughfare, an enhanced emphasis on construction site and contractor lay down area &lsquo;housekeeping' activities, standards, and procedures will be required year-round, throughout construction.</p>

<p>THIS IS A FISCAL YEAR (FY) 2014 REQUIREMENT. FUNDS ARE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. ALL QUOTATIONS SHALL REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR A PERIOD OF 90 DAYS.<br />***Line item 0001 is a BRAND NAME or EQUAL requirement. Brand name or equal description is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be considered satisfactory to meet the agency's needs.***<br />Line Item 0001: Quantity one (1) each, photon counting X-ray area detector, meeting or exceeding the following salient characteristics. Used or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award.<br />Background Information:<br />The Dimensional Metrology for Nanomanufacturing Project (within the Energy and Electronic Materials Group of the Material Science and Engineering Division) develops and advances X-ray and neutron scattering methods as quantitative tools to characterize the shape, size, orientation, degree of ordering, and fidelity of nanoscale features patterned by advanced lithography and self-assembly techniques for the semiconductor industry. X-ray metrology works effectively using high-intensity, high energy (~20 keV) synchrotron radiation at national user facilities; however it is a challenging measurement for commercially available laboratory sources due to insufficient source intensity. The inherently weak signal from laboratory sources makes the reduction of detector noise critical to increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. This purchase will upgrade our current laboratory system to an ultralow noise detector with large dynamic range. This detector purchase is essential for proof of concept testing of the CDSAXS method in the measurement of dimensional features in a transmission scattering geometry on semiconductor structures such as patterned lines of known nanoscale pitch. <br />Salient Characteristics:<br />Purchase of a photon counting X-ray area detector optimized for measuring hard X-rays (E~20 keV) with a linear signal response over a high dynamic count range, with energy discrimination (peak selection and fluorescence rejection), no detector* background or readout noise, no discernible inter-pixel cross talk (i.e., low point spread function or indirect spreading of X-ray counts from one pixel to the next), and with a high lateral and temporal stability. This detector will be coupled to the existing NIST CDSAXS instrument.<br />* Detectors will always collect X-rays from cosmic events and environmental sources. The requirement here is that the detector to not contribute to these background count levels in any measureable way.<br />Detector Requirements:<br />Dectris Pilatus 300K-W (1um thick sensor) , or a detector meeting the following salient characteristics.<br />1. The detector shall have photon counting capability and be sensitive to single X-ray photons (not an integrating/analog detector, which cannot distinguish between several low energy photons or one high energy photon)<br />2. The detector active area dimensions shall be greater than 33 mm X 251 mm<br />3. The detector pixel dimensions shall be less than or equal to 172 um X 172 um<br />4. The detector point spread function shall be less than or equal to 172 um X 172 um<br />5. The detector photon efficiency shall be greater than or equal to 50% for 22 keV radiation.<br />6. Background counts shall be less than or equal to 0.15 X-ray photons / pixel / hour, and the detector shall have no discernible readout noise or dark current<br />7. The dynamic range shall be from 1 X-ray photon / pixel to 1,000,000 or greater X-ray photons / pixel<br />8. Detector shall have less than 0.03% defective pixels 9. The detector shall allow shutterless operation with a frame rate of greater than or equal to 20 Hz<br />10. The system shall include all necessary control electronics/computers, cables, and hardware<br />11. The detector shall include continuous threshold for an extended energy range (2.7 keV to 18 keV)<br />12. The vendor will include a re-usable shipping case for safe transportation of the detector to alternative locations.<br />Computer Requirements:<br />A control computer separate from any required detector data processing computers shall be included in the purchase with the following specifications:<br />1. The system shall include two LCD monitors with a diagonal of greater than or equal to 24", a pixel resolution of at least 1920 x1200, brightness of greater than or equal to 300 cd/m^2, and a contrast ratio of at least 1000:1<br />2. The computer shall be a Dell Precision T3600 or equivalent with the following salient characteristics:<br />a) Xeon E5 series, 6 core processor operating at 3.2 GHz with 12MB of L2 cache or better <br />b) At least 16GB of DDR3 RDIMM memory operating at 1600 MHz or faster<br />c) Boot hard drive shall be solid state drive with at least 256GB of storage capacity and 6GB/s transfer rate<br />d) Shall include secondary hard drive with 2 TB or greater of data storage operating at least 7200 rpm <br />e) 1GB Nvidia quadro 2000 video card or better<br />f) Windows 7 professional operating system<br />The Contractor shall provide at least one (1) year warranty on all parts, labor and materials.<br />DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS:<br />All items shall be received not later than 4 months after receipt of the order.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria:<br />Award shall be made to the Contractor whose quote offers a firm fixed price and is the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement", 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. Technical capability and past performance, when combined, shall be approximately equal to price.

<p>a) FAR 52-212-1 Instructions to offerors-Commercial items (Jul 2013).</p>
<p>b) FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>This provision is incorporated by reference, and paragraph (a) is modified to read as follows:</p>
<p>(a) This is a competitive best value source selection in which the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, and other factors considered. The Government intends to make award to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror. The Government intends to award without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. The following listed are evaluation factors that shall be used in the evaluation process:</p>
<p>1. Price</p>
<p>2. Technical Capability: Technical Acceptability is achieved when the offeror provides proof that the products meet the minimum standards of Item Descriptions, the stated Delivery Date, and Quality Products (or Equal) (i.e., products brochures and/or products data shall be attached to the price proposal). <br />All offerors shall submit technical description of the products being offered in sufficient detail in addition to the price proposal, to evaluate compliance with the requirements in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(i) Initially, offers shall be ranked according to evaluated prices. The price evaluation will document for the offers evaluated the completeness, and reasonableness of the proposed price. Incomplete or unreasonable offers shall be rejected and eliminated from further consideration. A single award will result from this evaluation.</p>
<p>(ii) Next, the Government shall evaluate the offerors's technical information as referenced in paragraph (a) 2 above. Technical Acceptability for all offerors will be rated as "met" or "failed" by personnel designated in 730th AMS. Technical acceptability is met when the offeror submits proof of technical descriptions/information as stated above and compliance with the delivery requirement.</p>
<p>(iii) If the lowest offeror meets the Government technical capability as defined in above paragraph (a) 2, this Purchase Order will be awarded to the lowest offeror with technically acceptable capability. If the lowest offeror fails to meet the Government technical acceptable capability, the Government will then go to the next low offeror in the same manner if they meet the technical capability. This process will continue until an offeror is found to meet the Government technical acceptable capability in ascending order of the low price.</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>

<DESC>Synopsis
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  
The solicitation number, VA69D-13-Q-1706, is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ) for the development of the Magnet redesignation report.  This document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular  and Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation Supplement (VAAR).  This is a Firm Fixed Price contract and is a 100% Small Business set aside underthe North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541990, Size Standard: $14.0 million dollars.  Offeror's quotes are hereby being requested and shall be submitted on offeror's letterhead or bid form and shall contain the name, title, and signature of person authorized to submit quotes on behalf of the contractor.  The following commercial services are being requested in this solicitation as detailed in the Statement of Work (SOW).  All quotes should be based on minimum requirements listed in the SOW.  Quotes are due September 13, 2013 at 12:00PM CST. Offeror shall provide the following:  
Description:  The William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital located at 2500 Overlook Terrace, Madison, WI 53705 has a requirement for an electronic submission of the Magnet redesignation report.  
Performance Work Statement:  The William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital, as part of its mission for quality health care with Veterans, is seeking Magnet redesignation (its second designation).  The Magnet Recognition Program was developed by the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) to recognize health care organizations for nursing excellence.  An electronic submission is the preferred method for the 15 inch/4.4MB Magnet report that will be submitted for redesignation.  This saves paper, binding costs, and can easily be updated.  An outside vendor, who is familiar with the ANCC requirements, is able to create a website and ensure that it has been tested for quality and ready for submission.  Other facilities within VISN 12 and the VHA have contracted with outside vendors for electronic submission support.  Objectives for this support for an electronic submission are to:  1) develop a web-based report that is compliant with the ANCC guidelines for electronic submission;  2) provide a report that is easy for appraisers to navigate and review;  3) provide ability for ongoing updates and maintenance;  4) ensure submission is reviewable anywhere at any time;  5) increase presentation quality;  6) provide a secure website.  
Requirements:  If the VA does not obtain electronic submission support, we will not have the support in an efficient and comprehensive manner to develop an electronic submission of the Magnet redesignation report. Based on the ANCC Magnet Recognition Program, electronic submission support must develop the electronic submitted report by:
1. Creating timelines for completion of the Magnet redesignation report.  2. Developing the report in a web-based format, CD-ROM or flash/thumb drive.  3. Developing a report not to exceed 4.4 MB.  4. Clearly labeling the report with the name of the organization.  5. Organizing all components by folder and file format according to Magnet Application Manual, including a Table of Contents for the report and each section.  6. Organizing documents with hyperlinks to evidence that return to the narrative.  7. Testing links prior to sending the report to the appraisers and the Magnet Program Office.  8. Developing a report that is easy to navigate.  9. Being compliant with the ANCC guidelines for submission.  10. Providing a support team to the Madison VA's Magnet and Evidence-based Practice Manager throughout the development process.  11. See attached additional specifications.  

Scope:  A partnership to develop a web-based, secure, and easily navigable electronic submission meeting the ANCC guidelines effective December 1, 2012.
Deliverables/Deliver Schedule:  The scope of service is being contracted from the date of award and is due January 1, 2014 for development of an electronic submission of the Magnet document.  
Equipment/Security:  No additional equipment is needed.  The website developed will be secure, meeting the VA requirements.

In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.  <br>    <br>  (b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:  <br>    <br>     (1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days  <br>     after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation  <br>     agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.  <br>    <br>     (2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a  <br>     novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this  <br>     clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause  <br>     in the contract.  <br>    <br>     (3) For long-term contracts-  <br>    <br>       (i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract;  <br>       and  <br>       (ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for  <br>       exercising any option thereafter.  <br>    <br>  (c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract.

The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.  <br>    <br>  (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.  <br>    <br>  (g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in SAM, or does not have a representation in SAM for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:  <br>    <br>       The Contractor represents that it [ ] is, [ ] is not a small business concern  <br>       under NAICS Code ______________ assigned to contract number ______________.   <br>       [Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title].  <br>    <br>  (End of clause)  <br>    <br>  52.252-2 Clauses Incorporated by Reference (FEB 1998).  <br>    <br>  This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)  (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.  (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.  (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:      (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and      (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.    (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:      (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and      (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.    (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause?      (1) Contract financing payment has the meaning given in FAR 32.001.      (2) Designated agency office has the meaning given in 5 CFR 1315.2(m).      (3) Electronic form means an automated system transmitting information electronically according to the Accepted electronic data transmission methods and formats identified in paragraph (c) of this clause.  Facsimile, email, and scanned documents are not acceptable electronic forms for submission of payment requests.      (4) Invoice payment has the meaning given in FAR 32.001.      (5) Payment request means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the contractor under this contract.  (b) Electronic payment requests. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this clause, the contractor shall submit payment requests in electronic form. Purchases paid with a Government-wide commercial purchase card are considered to be an electronic transaction for purposes of this rule, and therefore no additional electronic invoice submission is required.  (c) Data transmission. A contractor must ensure that the data transmission method and format are through one of the following:      (1) VA?s Electronic Invoice Presentment and Payment System. (See Web site at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp.)      (2) Any system that conforms to the X12 electronic data interchange (EDI) formats established by the Accredited Standards Center (ASC) and chartered by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
