This BAA is conducted using full and open competition.  In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, this BAA utilizes a two-step process. The first step will be the submission of a concept paper. Offerors that submit concept papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the government will be invited to submit a proposal (step two). Such an invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Instructions for the submission of concept papers and proposals are contained in the BAA. The submission of a concept paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal.  Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA.  Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process.  A proposal's technical evaluation and its importance to agency programs, along with funding availability are primary bases for contract award.  Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate.  Concept papers will be accepted continuously through 28 February 2015.  This BAA will remain open continuously through 31 March 2015. The BAA technical areas of interest are divided into the following groups:  A.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<DESC>MOBILITY AIR FORCES (MAF) DYNAMIC RETASKING CAPABILITY (DRC) HARDWARE CONTRACTOR LOGISTICS DEPOT SUPPORT
<p>1. Introduction<br />DRC is a former Urgent Operational Need (UON), validated by AFCENT in February 2011, fielded in May 2012, and approved by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) as an Enduring Capability in September 2012. The U.S. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Battle Management Directorate, Theater Battle Control Division at Hanscom AFB, MA, is seeking potential sources of CONUS based Depot level Contractor-Logistics-Support (CLS) for its fielded (CONUS/OCONUS) MAF DRC assets. The DRC Program Office contemplates using CLS for Depot level support of DRC for the foreseeable future. Presently the Air Force has installed and fielded DRC A-Kits on sixty-eight (68) Mobility Air Forces (MAF) aircraft. These A-Kit equipped aircraft are capable of accepting the thirty-six (36) DRC B-kits which were also produced and fielded on the DRC contract. Additionally, there are twelve (12) Field-Test-Equipment (FTE) units assigned to operational units flying DRC equipped aircraft. This hardware (A-Kits, B-Kits, FTEs) is used to sustain DRC operations at seven (7) CONUS and three (3) OCONUS locations.</p>
<p>1.1. A-kits are permanently installed on forty-four (44) C-130J and twenty-four (24) C-17 aircraft. A-Kit installations include cargo bay to cockpit wiring, patch panel, hull mounted antennas, and B-Kit component mounts.</p>
<p>1.2. B-kits are Roll-On, Roll-Off (RORO) assemblies which are easily installed/removed in the cargo bay and cockpit.</p>

<p>1.2.2. Cockpit Installation: The cockpit mounted B-Kit components are comprised of two (2), easily installed/removed, Portable Mission Display (PMD) monitor/control devices (2" x 6" x 9" screen with bezel mounted controls).</p>
<p>1.3. Software: The DRC B-Kit Airborne Executive Processor (AEP) and Portable Mission Display (PMD) use DRC software version 6.2. DRC version 6.2 incorporates Northrop Grumman developed software for which the Government has both Government Purpose rights and Restricted rights. Restricted, or Northrop Grumman proprietary software titles follow:<br />&bull; Message Broker Services and Operator Station Human-System Interface (HIS) Baseline<br />&bull; Gateway Manager Software Capabilities:<br />o MIDS ETR on MIDS Ethernet<br />o MIDS 1553 virtual terminal and virtual host capabilities<br />o MIDS Platform A terminal emulation mode routing raw FIM/FOM data</p>
<p>1.4. FTEs are land based test units originally produced as developmental tools for the DRC system. Today FTEs are primarily employed as operational test units and have also been employed as DRC system ground stations capable of communicating with DRC aircraft in flight.</p>
<p>1.4.1. The FTE is comprised of a cabinet (3' x 3' x 4'), power distribution device, laptop computer, SADL radio, PRC-117G radio, PSC-5 radio, fans, filters and wiring.</p>

<DESC>Purpose:  To identify potential sources and candidate solutions that may satisfy the Air Soldier Radio Interface Control Module (RICM) requirements as provided in the attached thin specification and to solicit feedback regarding the high level requirements captured in these documents.  The responses to this RFI will be used to assist in formulating the strategy for developing and qualifying a RICM and develop an initial list of potential offerors that may elect to participate in a future Request for Proposal (RFP) leading to the execution of a competitively awarded 2-3 yr contract to develop, manufacture test articles, and to qualify the Air Soldier System (Air SS) RICM solution as part of a pre-planned product improvement.   <br>  <br> Background:  Air Soldier is the next generation aircrew mission and protective ensemble that will replace the legacy Air Warrior (AW) system currently being used by Army rotary and select fixed wing aircrew members.  Air Soldier encompasses all clothing and individual equipment worn or carried by the pilot, including ancillary aircraft mounted hardware and components, that serve the primary objectives of physiological sustainment, personal protection, and enhancing mission performance; while operating in all environmental and threat conditions, including crash and post crash escape and evasion scenarios.  The Air Soldier system consists of four primary subsystems, defined as follows: <br>  <br> 1.  A fully integrated suite of personal electronics equipment that replaces stovepipe legacy components and provides improved data processing, control, and presentation technologies to reduce overall pilot workload while providing a minimum 15% net reduction in bulk and weight.   <br>   <br> 2.  A modular helmet and display system featuring increased crash protection, enhanced durability, head tracking and a high resolution display that is common to all Aircraft (A/C). <br>  <br> 3.  A revolutionary personal protective clothing ensemble and gear carriage system that provides protection equal to or better then the legacy AW system, while providing a minimum 20% reduction in bulk and weight through a reduction in layering and utilization of active thermal regulation. <br>  <br> 4.  A fully optimized man/machine interface that maximizes the use of wireless interfaces to enhance aircrew mobility and the ability to safely ingress/egress the A/C in all mission configurations. <br>  <br> The Air Soldier System (Air SS) is managed by the Air Warrior Product Manager's Office located in Huntsville, AL.  The RICM RFP is anticipated for release in Second Quarter FY2014.   <br>  <br> Instructions:  Attached to this RFI is the EMD-AVNS-PRF-10836 RICM thin specification releasable to all.  A thin specification defines the high level functional performance, system interface, and environmental requirements that must be met by the future Air Soldier RICM system.  The thin specification also contains basic information regarding future procurement requirements that may be useful to potential offerors in determining their level of interest in this RFI.  Also available is the Air Soldier Software Interface Control Document (ICD) for the Soldier Computer Module (SCM).  The ICD is not releasable to foreign nationals.  Eligible contractors may request this document from {Cassandra Boyd,  ATTN: CCAM-AR-D , 6726 Odyssey Drive, Huntsville, AL 35806.  Request that interested parties provide a written response to this RFI NLT 04 November 2013} to  cassandra.boyd1@us.army.mil or  Cassandra Boyd,  ATTN: CCAM-AR-D, 6726 Odyssey Drive, Huntsville, AL 35806.  Submissions can be through written correspondence and/or electronic mail.  Responses should include, at a minimum:  <br>  <br> a.  name and address of the interested company or organization;  <br> b.  contact information for the primary POC;  <br> c.  a brief description of the potential offeror's company/organization and candidate technology or product as it relates to the Air SS RICM requirements; <br> d.  a description of how the potential offeror's product or technology either currently meets or how it could be developed to meet the Air SS RICM requirement.  <br> e.  an assessment of the current Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the candidate solution.  TRL categories may be found in DOD Deskbook 5000.2. <br> f.  a Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) cost and time estimate to complete development and qualification of the technology;  <br> g.  feedback regarding the thin spec's high level requirements.  Specifically does the offeror consider the requirements are; reasonable or unreasonable, realistic or unrealistic, obtainable or unobtainable, applicable or not applicable.   <br> h.  any comments or questions regarding the requirements contained in the attached documents. <br>  <br> Comments regarding the attached thin specifications will be considered in the formulation of the final RFP.  <br>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DESIGN AND INSTALLATION OF ENGINEERING CONTROL EQUIPMENT ON EXISITNG Di-Glycol Amine (DGA) GAS SWEETNING COLUMN, AMARILLO TEXAS. The BLM Amarillo Field Office, Helium Operations Amarillo Texas is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy for warranty, parts and maintenance on  engineering control modification to existing  natural gas treatment DGA column located in Amarillo, TX. 
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This is not a formal solicitation. This sources sought notice is a Request For Information (RFI). This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred. The government is not obligated to, and will not, pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis. Contact with Government personnel, other than the Contract Specialist or Contracting Officer, by potential offeror or their employees regarding this requirement is strictly prohibited. 
REQUIREMENT: 
Contractor shall provide personnel, management, parts and warranty maintenance for designed and installed engineering controls to existing process equipment.  The current vent stack on the columns needs to be modified to capture moisture, liquids and particulates currently being released from the top of the column.  Liquids maybe captured with a designed knockout drum or condenser type addition to the columns system.  Other designs that would meet mitigation of released substances will be entertained. The Di-Glycol Amine (DGA) Column is a well-defined natural gas process used to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) and moisture from a process stream. The current issue is that emissions are condensing after leaving the vent stack and depositing residue on neighboring equipment. When still wind conditions occur, the droplets and mist reach ground level and personnel operating in the affected areas.  Mitigation techniques of the misting and droplet releases from the vent stack are being sought through this notice. Liquids recovered may be returned to the DGA system. An additional concern is the presence of a revolting odor (possibly a sulfur based compound) also being released from this system.  Mitigation of the odor is highly desirable. Applicable standards are: National Building Code, ASME codes for pressure vessels, and Texas air quality standards.
To demonstrate an interest in this Sources Sought Notice, please submit your capability to design and install process equipment and provide warranty maintenance for added components.  Please provide the following information: 
1) Company name, point of contact, address, email address, Website address, telephone number, size of company, Cage Code, DUNs Number and Certifications and Representations 2) Company's capability statement addressing the particulars of requirement with appropriate supporting documentation. 3) A statement indicating the offeror's ability to prepare and submit detailed invoices via ipp.gov. 4) Company socio-economic Program Participation: small, HUBZone, 8(a), SDB, Woman-owned, Service Disabled Veteran-owned. 5) Please provide only the minimum information necessary to demonstrate capability at this time. 6) Must be registered in sam.gov in order to conduct business with the government.

<DESC>Questions & Answers on VA118-13-I-0643

1.	Regarding VA current SCCM 2007 enterprise implementation, does VA currently use SCCM for the following functionality?

SCCM functionality currently in use	Windows Workstations
(Y/N)	Windows servers
(Y/N)	Apple Workstations
(Y/N)	Unix/Linux Servers
(Y/N)
SCCM Discovery of installed software	Y	Y	N	N
SCCM Software Catalog	Y	Y	N	N
SCCM Software Distribution	Y		N	N
SCCM Software Metering 	*Y		N	N

*We are currently monitoring 36 applications and are adding more based on requirements.  We estimate the ceiling to be approximately 200 products.

2.	If VA has not yet implemented any of the above SCCM features, can we assume that VA has plans to deploy these capabilities in the future or would VA like to have vendor proposed solution for any gap identified above?

There is no current funded project for SCCM 2012 in which non windows capabilities could be deployed.  VA does not have preference regarding how requirements are met at this time.  VA is conducting market research to assess the commercial space as it relates to current VA requirements and enterprise state.

3.	Is VA looking for an asset inventory and distribution tool?  There are several requirements that call out the need for this (example see #'s 5 (software distribution), 14 (software deployment), 17 (software media library), 24 (discovery will identify virtual or physical), 25, 30 (metering is typically a function of discovery solutions), 31 (discovery technology removes the software), 32, 35 (removal of temporary software)).  We understand that SCCM, Tivoli Endpoint Manager, and BDNA may be in place and could be used to fulfill these requirements.

VA is looking for an Enterprise Software Asset Management solution as described in the requirements, including inventory and distribution for software to the extent described in the requirements.  Hardware assets are not targeted under this effort.  Existing tools deployed in the VA enterprise may be leveraged to the extent as delineated in the RFI.  BDNA discovery is not deployed throughout the VA enterprise. 

4.	It is unclear whether VA currently owns a Discovery tool that they are looking to augment or whether the bidders will need to supply a Discovery tool as part of the final solution.  Please clarify.

VA does not have preference regarding how requirements are met.  VA is conducting market research to assess the commercial space as it relates to current VA requirements.  Requirements include discovery.

5.	Is VA looking for a Catalog tool?  There are several requirements that call out the need for a request portal (example see #'s 13, 36, 37, 38, 39).

Yes, as part of the solution - to the extent such is described in the requirements.

6.	Are there any request and approval portals in place or would you be looking for a solution here?

No request and approval portals are currently in place for software across the enterprise.  

7.	Does VA have an ownership repository that tracks the purchases of hardware?  This repository would track the procurement and lifecycle status of hardware assets which would be needed to accurately assess compliance.  If yes, can you describe how this is accomplished?

ESAM is a software asset management project, not hardware.

8.	Design Constraints Specifications:  The solution software and hardware shall comply with the One VA Technical Reference Model (TRM) and the Enterprise Technical Architecture Compliance Criteria.  Please explain the "One VA Technical Reference Model (TRM) and the Enterprise Technical Architecture Compliance Criteria."

Links to the TRM and ETACC:
One VA Technical Reference Model (TRM) 
Enterprise Technical Architecture Compliance Criteria

9.	Bring Your Own Endpoint (BYOD):  The solution shall support meet the requirement defined herein for BYOD regardless of how the license is structured, i.e. (a) concurrent, (b) endpoint based, (c) named user, etc.  Please respond below for each separately.

Please explain "requirement defined herein for BYOD"  

BYOD devices have license requirements depending on how they connect to the network and who connects.  Therefore the need to manage these licenses as well. 

Are these endpoints all mobile devices or are users bringing their own workstations?

A BYOD can be a wireless device laptop, desktop or any approved device that connects to the VA network and provided by the employee.  A home personnel computer used to connect to the VA network via the Citrix access gateway is an example of a non-wireless BYOD.  These devices have license requirements as well depending on how they connect.

Does the VA already possess any technology for Mobile Device Management?

Yes, VA uses Airwatch for Mobile device management

10.	Software Titles:  The solution shall meet the requirements herein for software applications from all major software vendors.  The following vendors shall be supported in the initial phase of the project: (a) Microsoft, (b) Oracle, (c) VMware, (d) Red Hat, (e) Citrix, and (f) Adobe.  (Please respond below to each separately).

Please explain "requirements herein for software applications from all major software vendors" Clearly other vendors will be required in future phases.

VA anticipates a phased approach to implementing the solution, applying the Software Asset Management solution to these vendors first and then expanding to all vendors and software titles.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SUP 5252.204-9400 Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (July 2013)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY <br />This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES <br />Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS <br />In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below. Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-Ni therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>INTERIM ACCESS <br />The Navy Command' s Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS <br />The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE <br />The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product) <br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out&shy; process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses of those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-67, Defense Circular Number 20130710, and Air Force Acquisition Circular 2013-0327. This requirement is being issued as a 100% small business set aside. The NAICS code is 812310 with a small business size standard of $7M.</p>
<p><br />The 355th Contracting Squadron intends to award competitively, a contract to furnish (101) heavy duty washers, (60) heavy duty electric dryers and (41) heavy duty gas dryers along with maintenance services at Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ. The contractor responsibilities shall include: materials, labor, tools, supplies, equipment, transportation, supervision and management and other service items necessary thereto. The Contractor shall perform in accordance with standards outlined in the Performance Work Statement. A Firm-Fixed Price contract will result from this posting, with period of performance to commence on 1 November 2013. The performance period of this contract shall consist of a base year plus 4 option years. There is no guarantee that options will be exercised. The anticipated award date for this acquisition is 19<br />Oct 2013.</p>
<p><br />The offeror shall provide a proposal in accordance with the attached Performance Work Statement and solicitation, FA4877-14-Q-0028.The proposals shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR Clause 52.212-2 "Evaluation of Commercial Items" located in the solicitation. Award shall be made to the lowest priced offeror that is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government. The proposal shall include the proposed pricing for CLINs 0001 through 4002, which includes the base year and four option years. The Government requires interested parties submit Past Performance References from at least two (2) federal government clients who have received the same or similar service. Only projects that have occurred within the previous three (3) years from the issuance of this solicitation shall be considered valid past performance. Past performance references should include the agency name, contract number, name and contact information of Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Representative, and period of performance.</p>
<p><br />Initially, proposals will be ranked according to price. Once the proposals are organized based upon price, the evaluation will commence, starting with the lowest priced proposal. If the lowest priced proposal meets all the evaluation criteria as outlined in FAR Clause 52.212-2 of the solicitation, award shall be made to that contractor. If the lowest priced proposal is deemed unacceptable, the Government will review the next lowest priced proposal. The evaluation process will continue until a proposal meets the requirements outlined in FAR Clause 52.212-<br />2 of the solicitation.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intention to award without discussions. If, however. at any time during the evaluation process the contracting officer deems discussions to be in the best interest of the Government, a competitive range will be established lAW FAR 15.306. The contracting office may determine that the number of proposals that might otherwise be included in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted.The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that<br />will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. If this occurs, discussions will be held with those offerors within the competitive range, and those outside of the range will be eliminated from consideration for award.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Tolebaev<br />Manging Director - Chief Engineer<br />National Company "Kazakhstan Temir Zholy"<br />#6 Konaev Street<br />010000 Astana<br />Republic of Kazakhstan<br />Phone: 7 (7172) 60-44-06<br />Fax: 7 (7172) 60-43-06<br /><br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for:<br /><br />1. Evaluate the current status of KTZ's Rail signaling and train control systems;<br />2. Evaluate current technologies to determine the best fit for KTZ's current and future train control and rail signaling plans;<br />3. Develop technical specifications for updating KTZ's equipment on a system wide or rail corridor by corridor basis;<br />4. Develop cost estimates of the above recommended systems.<br /><br />National Company &lsquo;Kazakhstan Temir Zholy' "Kazakhstan Railways" is engaged in an aggressive plan of railway development. A primary objective of this plan is to improve capacity on major corridors throughout the country, in particular to support domestic export and transit freight traffic growth taking advantage of KTZ's strategic "crossroads" position in Central Asia. In parallel, significant investment is underway and planned to improve and increase railway passenger service as demand for service presently outstrips supply and service quality requires improvement. KTZ anticipates most major lines in the country will continue to carry mixed passenger and freight traffic and they intend to bring peak speeds on main corridors from a present 140 kilometers per hour on main lines up to 160 and ultimately to 200 kilometers per hour. From a control, safety and capacity perspective these goals will be a technical challenge to achieve. Presently the major railway corridors in Kazakhstan are controlled using legacy Soviet Union-era electric automated block signal systems. These systems are outdated, costly to maintain and KTZ has assessed that they will be inefficient to support the capacity needs in accordance with projected future traffic levels and characteristics. The feasibility study will assess rail signaling and train control systems upgrades for three rail corridors on KTZ's railway network that are representative of the entire network.<br /><br />The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $655,188 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).<br /><br />Please note that this project did post a request for proposals in June 2011. However, no selection was made, and all bidders who submitted proposals then are encouraged to submit proposals again.<br /><br />A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a><br /><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.<br /><br />Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.<br /><br />Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Russian directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4:00 PM local time, October 15, 2013</span></strong> at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 01 - 608 - Manchester, NH is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.    (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.    (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions. <BR> <BR>(d) Section II, Installation. Section II shall provide pertinent installation information. It shall list all input and output connectors using applicable reference designators and functional names as they appear on the equipment. Included in this listing will be a brief description of the function of each connector along with the connector type. Instructions shall be provided as to the recommended method of repacking the equipment for shipment (packing material, labeling, etc.).    (e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.    (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches. <BR> <BR>The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>
