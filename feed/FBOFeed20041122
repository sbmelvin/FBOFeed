<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a modification to contract N00019-01-C-0066 for E-6 Contractor Logistics Support to increase cost-reimbursable contract line item value for a one year period for a total contract price change of $20,567,655.00 for procurement of S3 Kits, additional initial spares and spare parts, repair parts, modification and restoration of spares and repair of parts to ready-for-issue condition.  NAVAIR intends to award this modification to the incumbent contractor, Boeing Aerospace Operations, 2901 B South Douglas Blvd., Midwest City, OK, 73130-7125, on the basis of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1),  whereby the supplies and services required are available  from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This sole source procurement is based on the fact that Boeing is unwilling to sell data rights associated with a proprietary E-6 platform-unique sparing model developed at their own expense.    Additionally, this proprietary software is the only NAVAIR approved E-6 platform sparing model. Further, this model integrates with a database manager, containing the entire E-6 operational and wartime reserve kit spares inventory, capable of providing critical and detailed logistics information including mean time to repair, (MTTR), mean time between failure (MTBF), average repair time and average repair cost on an item-by-item basis for a rolling 18 to 24 month period.  The model also recognizes configuration similarities and differences between and among the several variants of the E-6A/B platform, including those currently in the MDS/ADWS modification cycle.  The Government will not pay for the development, test and validation of a new sparing model and database manager for this requirement.  Therefore, Boeing is the only firm with knowledge, experience and technical capability necessary to provide the required supplies and services in a timely manner for the purposes of meeting the fleets operational needs.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and there is no formal solicitation available for release. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested subcontracting opportunities in connection with this acquisition make contact with the incumbent contractor.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Technical Assistance for a Kenyatta National Hospital Resource Management and Infrastructure Project.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) signed a US$396,125 Technical Assistance grant with Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), the second largest hospital in sub-Saharan Africa.  KNH will use this Technical Assistance grant to hire a U.S. consultant team.  The selected U.S. consultant team would conduct the assessments through an independent review and by working directly with KNH staff and management to determine the various departments’ needs within the hospital.  The team would then conduct a series of stakeholder workshops to review their findings and present recommendations for strategic plans for managerial and hospital reorganization, equipment procurement, and the computerization of hospital functions and processes.  Finally the team will assist KNH with developing procurement specifications for initial procurement plans.

A summary of the Terms of Reference (TOR) for this project is as follows:

Task 1:  Organization and Human Resource Analysis.  

Task 2:  Business Requirements Analysis.  

Task 3:  Hospital Medical Equipment Strategic Plan.

Task 5:  Final Report.  


The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $396,125 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

This sole source award is based on FAR Part 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Anticipated award date is the first quarter of fiscal year 2005.

The applications currently run on the Combined Tactical Trainer and Analysis System (CTTAS) simulation engine,  which is a NG Proprietary product.  NG performed the training analysis for this software, and possesses Instructional System Design (ISD) specialists and subject matter experts that are already familiar with this system and the requirements of the customer, reducing confusion and saving time.  The NG CTTAS simulation engine includes a customized instructor console.  Any interested vendor will have to provide a commiserate instructor console for this contract.  NG possesses a thorough familiarity with the interface requirements and has the ability to make rapid changes to the simulation engine if required.  Another vendor must possess a simulation engine that can interface with the existing applications, and perform the upgrades, with appropriate site licenses to implement the necessary changes within the required timeframes.  There has already been a large investment of funds in the development of this effort.  Due to the need to make these enhancements in the shortest time possible, the original contractor has the most intimate knowledge and personnel assets to achieve this goal.

NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Systems Company (RSC), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, Arizona 85734-1337.  Raytheon is the only company capable of performing this effort and is currently in negotiations to award a CCLS production contract.  Since 1994, RSC has been the sole developer, designer and manufacturer for the Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR).  RSC solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk Block IV missile.  RSC currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tactical Tomahawk missile is required to perform this upgrade to the CCLS, RSC is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation. 

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor’s license may be substituted for the business license in states that do not issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver’s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.
 

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

The packing crate for the mold is reusable, and the Gov’t expects this to be used for the return trip.  While in the possession of the contractor, liability for any damage to the mold will belong to the contractor.  The mold is considered to be in the possession of the contractor from the time it is received from DDSP until it is returned.  The mold is valued at approximately $110,000.00.  The totebox bottom shall be rigid with a smooth flat surface on the outside.  Flatness of the bottom shall vary not more than 1/32 inch in a downward (convex) direction or 1/16 inch in an upward (concave) direction when viewed from the outside.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The School of Applied Information Technology (SAIT) was established as part of the FSI in October 1996.  The School of Applied Information Technology (SAIT) at the Foreign Service seeks a teaching authority that must certify SAIT instructors, to begin the process of becoming a MCT (Microsoft certified trainer) or CCT (CISCO certified trainer).  Microsoft and CISCO both accept CTT+ as accreditation in the process of becoming a MCT or CCT.  SAIT is an accredited Microsoft and CISCO partner.  Both corporations require the organization they partner with to have certified personnel before instructional material may be purchased from their respective headquarters.  FTE instructors rotate through SAIT positions and the new instructors must meet the requirements that allow SAIT to maintain their partnership status.  CTT+ is an important step in this process.    

All interested parties must respond in writing to wilkersondm@state.gov, by November 4, 2004.

<DESC>Review of Bids Submitted by Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug Plan Sponsors

Background

The recently-enacted Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA)  has expanded the role of private entities in providing benefits to Medicare beneficiaries.  First, the law adds a new section to the Social Security Act, 1860D (“Part D”), that offers prescription benefits beginning in 2006 through Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs).  Secondly, the statute allows for payments to Medicare Advantage (MA) “local plans”, formerly Medicare Plus Choice (M+C) plans, and creates a new type of private plan, “Regional” MA plans.  Finally, the legislation specifies that, beginning with contract year 2006, organizations bidding for contracts or with contracts that offer PDP and MAs must annually submit bids that support the actuarial basis of its pricing.  The 2006 bids are to be submitted to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services by June 6, 2005.

CMS’ Office of the Actuary has been assigned the responsibility to review the submitted bids for reasonableness against CMS guidelines and instructions, conformity with the statute, and compliance with the appropriate Actuarial Standards of Practice.  Given the required coordination of the actuarial bid reviews with related activities to be performed by other CMS components, OACT’s assessment of the bids must be completed in relatively short timeframe (approximately 6 weeks).  However, OACT does not have adequate number of staff members required to review and approve the anticipated volume of bids within this timeline.  As a result, CMS/OACT intends to procure advisory and assistance services from independent actuarial firm(s) to assist with the review of the 2006 MA and PDP actuarial bids.

Contractor responsibility

Contractor will review the reasonableness of assigned bids in consideration of (i) CMS’ bid submission instructions, (ii) CMS’ bid review guidelines, and (iii) professional actuarial standards.

The reviews will be performed within a set bid review process to be established by CMS.  Some of the main components of the process are listed below. For each assigned bid, the process will contain a representation of the original submitted bid supplemented with additional data such as statistical distribution of key values across all peer plans and an overview of the filed benefit package.   Additionally, the bid review process will provide an e-mail communication link to actuary that developed the bid.  Finally, contractor is to communicate to CMS the result of his reviews by completing the appropriate status section of the review process.

CMS’ review guidelines highlight the most important areas for the bid reviews for both Part D and other benefits (that is, Part A, Part B, and non-Medicare covered).  The most important areas to be examined are the (i) base period data, (ii) projection of base period data to the contract year, (iii) manual projection data if base period data is absent or deemed to be less than fully credible, and (iv) components of resulting bid for the contract year.

The review of the bids will take place between June 8, 2005 and September 2, 2005, with the bulk of the work to be completed by July 30, 2005.  Additionally, the contractor will be required to attend a training session in May 2005 (date TBD) and provide CMS with a written evaluation of their experience with the bid reviews by September 30, 2005.

At this time, neither the bid form nor the bid review specifications are available for release.  However, the draft bid form will be posted on CMS’ web site on or about November 29, 2004 at http:/cms.hhs.gov, or may be obtained by sending an e-mail request to actuarial-bid@cms.hhs.gov.  Additionally, the specifications for the bid review system process will be contained in the Request for Contract package (to be sent in early 2005).

Type of Procurement 

CMS anticipates issuance of multiple awards of indefinite-quantity contracts under the forthcoming single solicitation to two or more sources using Firm Fixed Price task orders with a minimum order to gear up and complete training requirements and a maximum order limitation to be determined based on feedback from this RFI.   It is also anticipated that these awards will be issued with a base year and 3 options.  However, CMS does reserve the option to use any other procurement instrument as deemed appropriate at the time of the official solicitation.  

Response requested from prospective contractors

CMS would like you to respond to this RFI with the following information.  

1.	Your firm’s experience, establishing and reviewing pricing of managed health care plans, including prescription drug benefits.  Please provide examples of establishing and reviewing pricing by specifying the type of health care plans (for example, Medicare Advantage programs, Medicaid, commercial, and retiree health).  Also, if applicable, please provide a description of your experience in subcontracting with other actuarial consulting firms.

2.	As a rough measure of workload capability, please provide the average weekly hours of labor that could be committed to this work from June 8, 2005 through July 31, 2005.

3.	Please provide the information on the staff and/or subcontractors or consultants that would be assigned to the work described above.  Specifically, grouped by job classification, please provide an indication of the (i) general qualification /experience for each job classification, (ii) proportion of the project workload (described in # 2) to be performed by staff assigned to each classification, and (iii) average hourly billing rate, including overhead.  Examples of job classification are principal, senior consultant, consultant, actuary, actuarial student, technician, etc.

4.	Indication of other consulting engagements, or other situations that may prevent organization from performing unbiased review of bids submitted on behalf of specific organizations.  In other words, please describe potential conflicts of interest or apparent conflicts of interest with this project.  For example, we want to know of any direct involvement you have with clients by offering pricing or consulting regarding the MMA-created Medicare Advantage plans or Prescription Drug plans.   Also, provide information on your non-Medicare engagements with clients that currently offer Medicare Advantage products.

Instructions for responses

<SUBJECT>99--"Global Image 20.40.15 5P Coordinate Measuring Machine"
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Brown & Sharpe Inc., North Kingstown, RI.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Redstone Technical Test Center.  The Redstone Technical Test Center has a requirement to obtain one Global Image 20.40.15 5P Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM).  This requirement includes, but is not limited to, delivery, installation, set up and training at the technical test center location.  The Climatic Test Branch has the requirement to perform dimensional analysis for missile systems such as CKEM, Joint Common missile and Patriot missile among others.  This mission involves the use of high accuracy measuring systems.  This procurement action will replace an existing CMM system allowing measurement of systems exceeding one meter in length.  The Brown & Sharpe CMM system requested will be 100% compatible with software developed for the existing CMM.  The current system includes over 25 custom written measurement programs which are executable on the requested CMM.  It would require an estimated 800 to 1000 man-hours to re-write all of the programs.  Re-programming would also have a detrimental effect on the test schedules of each affected missile system.  The current data base contains over 650 legacy files that are compatible with the requested CMM.  Switching to a measuring software other than PCDMIS would require the Climatic Test Branch to maintain PCDMIS software (currently yearly cost exceeding $2,000 per year) while paying additional maintenance costs for the new software.  CTB has invested over 300 man-hours in formal training in the operation of the existing measurement system, at a cost exceeding $30,000.  Switching to a new measurement system would require an investment in training as well as increasing the time required for measurements while engineers and technicians learn the new system.  To compete this action and award to another vendor would result in loss of compatibility.  It would also represent the loss of existing detailed measuring machine knowledge translating into a decrease in efficiency. Award to a vendor other than Brown & Sharpe Inc. would result in substantial duplication of costs that the Government is not expected to recover through open competition. Therefore, due to time, compatibility, and related cost issues, no other vendor other than Brown & Sharpe Inc. meets the requirements.  RTTC has determined that the equipment required is available from only one responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy agency requirements. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST November 30, 2004 will be considered by the Government.  POC:  Will Galvin, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be e-mailed  to Will Galvin at William.galvin@mms.gov.

<SUBJECT>R -- Modification to Existing Contract to Develop Training Sessions for Using  Loving Support to Develop Breastfeeding Worksites Support Kit
<DESC>The Health Resources & Service Administration (HRSA), Maternal & Child Health Bureaus, intent to negotiate, on a sole source basis, to modify our contract with Best Start, Inc., of Tampa, FL.  This procurement shall be processed in accordance with Simplified Acquisition Procedures as outline in Federal Acquisitions Regulations (FAR) Part 13 and 6.  The purpose of this negotiation is to develop Training Sessions for the "Using Loving Support to Develop Breastfeeding Friendly Worksites Support Kit" developed by Best Starts Inc.  The contractor is in the process of developing a resource kit for employers to support women who choose to continue breastfeeding and lactation after returning to work.  In developing the content for the kit, recommendations from experts in employment and breastfeeding suggest development of draft curriculum for three (3) training sessions that will include a one-day interactive learning event.  This modification to the existing contract will allow the contractor to develop training sessions needed to orient breastfeeding advocates and lactation consultants who will be the “frontline resource” to employees on the use of the resource kit by employees. The current contractor is the only one who can develop these sessions.  Any other source would have to duplicate a substantial array of current and previous efforts to accomplish the same objects.  The Contractor has spent a considerable amount of effort in developing the Using Loving Support to Develop Breastfeeding Friendly Worksite Support Kit for the Maternal & Child Heath Bureau, HRSA, DHHS.   This is not s solicitation, but a notification of our intent to modify an existing contract.  A justification for other than full and open competition is on file.   Cite solicitation #05-S240-0257 D when corresponding.

<SUBJECT>D -- Notice to Award AFRN
<DESC>The Project and Contracting Office, Baghdad, Iraq, increased the ceiling on the Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery, IDIQ, contract, W914NS-04-D-0005, from $75M to $150M to enable the simultaneous issuance of a Task Order to Build-Out of the Advanced First Responder Network, AFRN.  

The AFRN system will provide Iraqi civil authorities, including fire, civil, and defense organizations with a national communications, command and control system.  It will provide real-time reliable voice, video, and data communications throughout Iraq to first responders from these organizations.

Technical experts from the Projects and Contracting Office, Baghdad, conducted market research in the August 2004 timeframe by assessing the complexity of the AFRN requirements and the ability of other sources to build-out the AFRN in additional Iraqi cities.  While there are other sources that are operating in Iraq, all of these sources would need to supplement their existing workforce with personnel with the skills to implement the AFRN and develop their own network design.  This would result in duplication of costs and delivery delays.  Consequently, the Government’s technical expert determined that only Lucent can meet the Government’s urgent requirements.

The Iraqi Minister of Interior, the Commander of Coalition Forces in Iraq, and the United States National Security Advisor have all stated that the immediate implementation of the AFRN in 16 cities is vital to the national security of Iraq.  Given the critical nature of security, especially in the wake of the transition of authority to a newly sovereign Iraq, any delay in implementing the AFRN in these 16 cities will significantly jeopardize the security to all personnel in Iraq.  It is estimated that use of any source, other than Lucent, would result in delays of 6-9 months.

Statement of Work:   The contractor shall obtain a digging permit upon notification of contract award and prior to commencement of work.  Digging permits are available from the Civil Engineer project manager Janie Schultz or Seth Foulkes.  Contractor shall remove concrete slabs, concrete fence post footings and trees north of the base perimeter fence line behind Jasmine Avenue at Altus AFB, Oklahoma.  The fence line work is approximately 2400 linear feet from the North Gate access to the flood canal at Command Circle/Jasmine Avenue. The current fence IDIQ contractor working on the removal and installation of a new perimeter fence is at a work stoppage pending completion of this requirement.  There are approximately 80 trees all varying in height from approximately 4 feet tall to 25 feet tall.  The contractor is required to remove only those trees along the fence line 5 feet south of the perimeter fence to 5 feet north of the perimeter fence line.  The trees to be removed will be identified with a tag by the government and private property owner(s).  Any tree stumps remaining are to be grinded to a below ground depth of 18 to 20 inches.   4-5 concrete slabs measuring approximately 5-6 square feet are to be removed from the flood canal along the perimeter.  The canal width is approximately 5-10 feet in width at the slab location.  The contractor shall replace the broken concrete slabs with rip-rap granite; each piece approximately 10-18 inches in diameter as fill-in for erosion prevention for those slabs removed.   There are approximately 15 concrete fence post footings to be removed.  These footings are not to be confused with the footings in place that have fence posts attached.  The footings to be removed are located near the canal end of the fence line and run west along the perimeter.  These footings will be located between the existing fence posts.  The concrete footings are approximately 8 inches in diameter and about 36 inches deep.  Backfill is not required for the holes left from the removal of the footings.  The contractor shall take precaution not to damage/disrupt the underground utility cables that are in proximity of the work to be conducted.  Any damages to surrounding landscaping, grass, shrubbery, etc. caused by movement of vehicles for the removal of disposal material from the site or similar damage from other types of vehicles and/or equipment shall be repaired and restored back to its original condition before the work on this project will be considered complete.  This includes any damages to the private land owner property along the fence perimeter.  Contractor clean-up shall be continuous on a daily basis.  Contractor shall remove and dispose of the afore mentioned materials to an approved landfill in accordance with environmental, local, federal and state laws and regulations. The period of performance for this project is not to exceed 10 working days from the notice to proceed.  Increment weather is an excuseable delay in order to prevent unnecessary damages to the land owner and government property.  The Contracting Officer shall be the only individual to determine if work is to be delayed.   Contractor shall submit a signed single line item lump sum proposal for the entire project to the contracting POC identified above.  The site visit is highly encouraged, but not mandatory. The magnitude of this project is estimated to be less than $30K.

Statement of Work:   The contractor shall obtain a digging permit upon notification of contract award and prior to commencement of work.  Digging permits are available from the Civil Engineer project manager Janie Schultz or Seth Foulkes.  Contractor shall remove concrete slabs, concrete fence post footings and trees north of the base perimeter fence line behind Jasmine Avenue at Altus AFB, Oklahoma.  The fence line work is approximately 2400 linear feet from the North Gate access to the flood canal at Command Circle/Jasmine Avenue. The current fence IDIQ contractor working on the removal and installation of a new perimeter fence is at a work stoppage pending completion of this requirement.  There are approximately 80 trees all varying in height from approximately 4 feet tall to 25 feet tall.  The contractor is required to remove only those trees along the fence line 5 feet south of the perimeter fence to 5 feet north of the perimeter fence line.  The trees to be removed will be identified with a tag by the government and private property owner(s).  Any tree stumps remaining are to be grinded to a below ground depth of 18 to 20 inches.   4-5 concrete slabs measuring approximately 5-6 square feet are to be removed from the flood canal along the perimeter.  The canal width is approximately 5-10 feet in width at the slab location.  The contractor shall replace the broken concrete slabs with rip-rap granite; each piece approximately 10-18 inches in diameter as fill-in for erosion prevention for those slabs removed.   There are approximately 15 concrete fence post footings to be removed.  These footings are not to be confused with the footings in place that have fence posts attached.  The footings to be removed are located near the canal end of the fence line and run west along the perimeter.  These footings will be located between the existing fence posts.  The concrete footings are approximately 8 inches in diameter and about 36 inches deep.  Backfill is not required for the holes left from the removal of the footings.  The contractor shall take precaution not to damage/disrupt the underground utility cables that are in proximity of the work to be conducted.  Any damages to surrounding landscaping, grass, shrubbery, etc. caused by movement of vehicles for the removal of disposal material from the site or similar damage from other types of vehicles and/or equipment shall be repaired and restored back to its original condition before the work on this project will be considered complete.  This includes any damages to the private land owner property along the fence perimeter.  Contractor clean-up shall be continuous on a daily basis.  Contractor shall remove and dispose of the afore mentioned materials to an approved landfill in accordance with environmental, local, federal and state laws and regulations. The period of performance for this project is not to exceed 10 working days from the notice to proceed.  Inclement weather is an excuseable delay in order to prevent unnecessary damages to the land owner and government property.  The Contracting Officer shall be the only individual to determine if work is to be delayed.   Contractor shall submit a signed single line item lump sum proposal for the entire project to the contracting POC identified above.  The site visit is highly encouraged, but not mandatory. The magnitude of this project is estimated to be less than $30K. The solicitation is amended to clarify:  Contractor is to remove existing trees within 15 feet south of the perimeter fence line of the work that is to be accomplished.  The cutoff fence posts embedded in concrete fence post footings to be removed extend the entire length of the perimeter fence line.  There are more than the original 15 identified.  Contractor may use a metal detector to determine if a buried cutoff fence post footing exists below ground.  Rights of Entry to land owner property will be included as part of the contract.  The contractor notice to proceed will be issued 10 days after announcement of contract award.  The contractor shall have 10 work days to complete all work from the date of the notice to proceed.  Department of Labor Wage Determination 94-2525 Revision 24 is hereby incorporated by reference.  The following FAR Clauses are hereby incorporated.

Statement of Work:   The contractor shall obtain a digging permit upon notification of contract award and prior to commencement of work.  Digging permits are available from the Civil Engineer project manager Janie Schultz or Seth Foulkes.  Contractor shall remove concrete slabs, concrete fence post footings and trees north of the base perimeter fence line behind Jasmine Avenue at Altus AFB, Oklahoma.  The fence line work is approximately 2400 linear feet from the North Gate access to the flood canal at Command Circle/Jasmine Avenue. The current fence IDIQ contractor working on the removal and installation of a new perimeter fence is at a work stoppage pending completion of this requirement.  There are approximately 80 trees all varying in height from approximately 4 feet tall to 25 feet tall.  The contractor is required to remove only those trees along the fence line 5 feet south of the perimeter fence to 5 feet north of the perimeter fence line.  The trees to be removed will be identified with a tag by the government and private property owner(s).  Any tree stumps remaining are to be grinded to a below ground depth of 18 to 20 inches.   4-5 concrete slabs measuring approximately 5-6 square feet are to be removed from the flood canal along the perimeter.  The canal width is approximately 5-10 feet in width at the slab location.  The contractor shall replace the broken concrete slabs with rip-rap granite; each piece approximately 10-18 inches in diameter as fill-in for erosion prevention for those slabs removed.   There are approximately 15 concrete fence post footings to be removed.  These footings are not to be confused with the footings in place that have fence posts attached.  The footings to be removed are located near the canal end of the fence line and run west along the perimeter.  These footings will be located between the existing fence posts.  The concrete footings are approximately 8 inches in diameter and about 36 inches deep.  Backfill is not required for the holes left from the removal of the footings.  The contractor shall take precaution not to damage/disrupt the underground utility cables that are in proximity of the work to be conducted.  Any damages to surrounding landscaping, grass, shrubbery, etc. caused by movement of vehicles for the removal of disposal material from the site or similar damage from other types of vehicles and/or equipment shall be repaired and restored back to its original condition before the work on this project will be considered complete.  This includes any damages to the private land owner property along the fence perimeter.  Contractor clean-up shall be continuous on a daily basis.  Contractor shall remove and dispose of the afore mentioned materials to an approved landfill in accordance with environmental, local, federal and state laws and regulations. The period of performance for this project is not to exceed 10 working days from the notice to proceed.  Inclement weather is an excuseable delay in order to prevent unnecessary damages to the land owner and government property.  The Contracting Officer shall be the only individual to determine if work is to be delayed.   Contractor shall submit a signed single line item lump sum proposal for the entire project to the contracting POC identified above.  The site visit is highly encouraged, but not mandatory. The magnitude of this project is estimated to be less than $30K.
