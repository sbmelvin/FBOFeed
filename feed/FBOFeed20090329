<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a Purchase Order to Toxin Technologies Incorporated, 7165 Curtiss Avenue, Avenue, Sarasota, FL 34231-8012. A CDC Purchase Order will be issued to acquire existing stocks of custom synthesized LBI202, rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Anti-SEB, 5mg/vial with presipment. A total of 500 mg (milligrams) or 100 vials of the subject monomeric immunoglobulin will be purchased from Toxin Technologies. The commercial products are being procured using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13, to exclude FAR Part 13.5. The authority for this sole-source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b).Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the continued need to match existing products for on-going exposure studies /research being conducted by the CDC, NCPDCID / Division of Bioterrorism Preparedness and Research. It is believed that the failure to procure existing IgG LBI202 standards in purities and batch lots currently offered by Toxin Technologies Inc. will alter or contaminate assays required for on-going research being conducted by the CDC. This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide Toxin Technologies' custom synthesized IgG by predetermined and specified purity and batch lot number are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days of the publication date of this synopsis. Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government. Respondents will assume all financial costs for preparing a response to this notice. The U.S. Government assumes no financial obligation for the preparation and distribution of prepared responses. Any and all solicitations issued in connection with this synopsis are advertised as Subject to Availability of Funding (SAF). Failure on the behalf of the CDC to secure appropriated funding at the time of award will result in the delay, reduction in part, or the cancellation of this acquisition in its entirety. Inquires may be sent to Russell T. Oxford by e-mail at roxford@CDC.gov or by fax to 770-488-2044.</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a Purchase Order to Toxin Technologies Incorporated, 7165 Curtiss Avenue, Avenue, Sarasota, FL 34231-8012. A CDC Purchase Order will be issued to acquire existing stocks of custom synthesized LBI202, rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Anti-SEB (staphylococcus enterotoxin B), 5mg/vial with preshipment sample. A total of 500 mg (milligrams) or 100 vials of the subject monomeric immunoglobulin will be purchased from Toxin Technologies. The commercial products are being procured using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13, to exclude FAR Part 13.5. The authority for this sole-source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b).Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the continued need to match existing products for on-going exposure studies /research being conducted by the CDC, NCPDCID / Division of Bioterrorism Preparedness and Research. It is believed that the failure to procure existing IgG LBI202 standards in purities and batch lots currently offered by Toxin Technologies Inc. will alter or contaminate assays required for on-going research being conducted by the CDC. This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide Toxin Technologies' custom synthesized IgG by predetermined and specified purity and batch lot number are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days of the publication date of this synopsis. Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government. Respondents will assume all financial costs for preparing a response to this notice. The U.S. Government assumes no financial obligation for the preparation and distribution of prepared responses. Any and all solicitations issued in connection with this synopsis are advertised as Subject to Availability of Funding (SAF). Failure on the behalf of the CDC to secure appropriated funding at the time of award will result in the delay, reduction in part, or the cancellation of this acquisition in its entirety. Inquires may be sent to Russell T. Oxford by e-mail at roxford@CDC.gov or by fax to 770-488-2044.</p>
