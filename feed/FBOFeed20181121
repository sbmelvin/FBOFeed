<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any responsible source who believes it is capable of meeting the requirement may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency, only if received by the closing date and time of this notice. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) intends to issue a request for proposal to Northrop Grumman (NG) for a resultant sole source, five-year Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity Contract under the statutory authority, as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B).
<p>U.S. Army, Product Manager Wideband Enterprise Satellite Systems and Product Officer Wideband Control (PO WC) requires Wideband Remote Monitoring Sensor (WRMS) integration, installation and systems engineering services. These services are required to enhance the current WRMS software and hardware to function more effectively with the Wideband Global Satellite Communications (SATCOM) (WGS) satellite constellation, along with significant integration efforts with codependent sub-systems. These upgrades will be installed at all Wideband SATCOM Operations Centers (WSOCs) and Remote Monitoring Control Equipment (RMCE) sites.</p>
<p>Due to the technical nature of the requirement, efforts to compete this requirement have failed. Therefore, failure to award to NG would severely limit the soldiers' ability to monitor and troubleshoot interference and jamming on the DSCS/WGS satellites and any additional WGS emerging enhancements. This would cripple the USASMDC/ARSTRAT and 53rd Signal Battalion's mission for continuous 24/7 monitoring and control of the satellite fleet. The inability to monitor and control the satellite communications payload through the WRMS sub-system would cause a breakdown in critical DoD communications, which could lead to a catastrophic event occurring with the potential to put military lives at risk and/or result in a high number of casualties.</p>

The outriggers must provide a minimum of an additional 12 inches (305 mm) to the fence height. The top guard fencing adjoining gates may range from a vertical height of 18 inches (457 mm) to the normal 45 degree outward protection, but for a limited distance along the fence line to adequately open the gates. Outriggers must be permanently affixed to the fence posts with screws or by spot welding. Screws used to affix outriggers to posts must be made tamper-proof either by design, peening, or welding. Gates will have a vertical 1ft (305 mm) of three stand barbed wire added to the fencing fabric instead outriggers at a 45-degree angle.</p>

The selvage will be twisted by adjacent pairs of wire ends together in a close helix of 11&frasl;2 machine turns, which is equivalent to three full twists. Twisted selvage must be provided on the top of the fence fabric to deter climbing and must be provided at the bottom of the fence fabric to deter borrowing.</p>
<p>g) Fencing fabric must be mounted on steel posts that are set in concrete with additional bracing at corners and gate openings. Posts must be vertical within plus or minus 2 degrees in each direction and spaced no more than 10 feet (3.048 m) apart. Posts must be embedded and encased in concrete a minimum of 3 feet (915 mm) deep with an additional 6 in (152.4mm) of concrete below the post and diameter of concrete foundation will be 4 times the diameter of the post except for gate posts which will be a minimum diameter of 24 in (609.6 mm). Minimum posts diameters for locations are below.</p>
<p>Pipe Minimum Size<br />Bottom or Brace Rails 1 5/8 in (41mm)<br />Line Post 2 &frac12; in (63.5mm)<br />Corner, End and Pull Posts 4 in (102mm)<br />Gate Post 4 in (102mm)</p>
<p><br />h) The gates will be two leafed swing gates which replace the existing gates and be no less than 20' wide. Locking mechanism for the gate will be chain and lock which the contractor will not have to provide.</p>

<CONTACT>Diane J Meeder, Phone (412)386-4412, Email DMeeder@cdc.gov
<DESC>"Dose Reconstruction and Related Activities for Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA)."
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Cincinnati, OH has a requirement for a base year, plus four (4) option years, Cost Plus Award Fee, Performance Based contract for "Dose Reconstruction and Related Activities for Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA)."</p>
<p>The objective of this acquisition is to allow National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), through its Division of Compensation Analysis and Support (DCAS), to fulfill its obligations under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act (EEOICPA), performing dose reconstructions for claims referred by DOL (Department of Labor) and evaluating petitions for additions of classes to the SEC (Special Exposure Cohort). More specifically, the objectives are to obtain assistance in performing the following activities:</p>
<p>&bull; Identify data relevant to reconstructing radiation doses and evaluating SEC petitions<br />&bull; Claimant Communications<br />&bull; Dose estimation and reporting<br />&bull; Prepare Special Exposure Cohort petition evaluations<br />&bull; Technical and program management support</p>
<p>2. References.</p>
<p>Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Radiation Dose Reconstruction website: http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/ocasppg.html</p>
<p>The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (EEOICPA or The Act), as Amended, established a compensation program for the civilian men and women who, over the past 50 years, have performed duties uniquely related to the nuclear weapons production and testing programs of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessor agencies. http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/pdfs/theact/eeoicpaall.pdf</p>
<p>The Act (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) was originally passed on October 30, 2000, and became effective on July 31, 2001. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (Public Law 107-107; Section 3151(b)) and the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 (Public Law 108-375; Section 3161) made several amendments to The Act.</p>
<p>Other references can be located on the Web such as: <br />42 CFR 81 (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/pdfs/42cfr81/frcll020612.pdf), <br />42 CFR 82 (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/pdfs/42cfr82/42cfr82.pdf), and <br />42 CFR 83 (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/pdfs/42cfr83/42cfr83b.pdf).</p>
<p>DRAFT PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT</p>
<p>The support services that the dose reconstruction contractor will be expected to provide are listed below. It is expected that this level of support will be required during the base year and during each option year. While the number of cases to be processed on an annual basis is subject to fluctuation, offerors should prepare their proposals assuming that 3,120 dose reconstructions will be required each year (60 per week for 52 weeks). Additionally, the contractor will be required to review previously completed dose reconstruction reports to determine if changes made in methodology or new data affects the outcome of the case. These reviews do not require a fully documented dose reconstruction unless the claim's compensability decision is likely to switch from non-compensable to compensable. It should be assumed that a weekly average of approximately 25 such evaluations need to be completed. It should be understood that this is not a guarantee of this level of effort, but a target value that will facilitate comparison of proposals. Offerors should assume that, for each year of the contract, 5 SEC petitions will be filed, and claims will be received from 5 sites with no claims previously submitted. Site research will be required for those situations. Technical approaches and some calculational tools from sites that have been researched prior to this award will be made available to the successful offeror by NIOSH. <br />All documents that describe radiation exposures, radiological operations, radiological conditions, and other information useful to performing dose reconstruction, evaluating SEC petitions, or performing other functions of the project will be stored in the Site Research Database (SRD). The SRD contains documents that relate to U.S. DOE and AWE sites. These documents can include, but are not limited to, general overview documents, publications for a site that describe a particular process or operation, or reports from a site addressing particular issues such as specific contaminants to which some workers might have been exposed. Project personnel populate and use the database to develop and write a wide variety of technical documents, as well as to perform dose reconstructions. <br />Information relevant to individual claims will be stored in the NIOSH OCAS Claims Tracking System (NOCTS). NOCTS was developed to track the claims made under EEOICPA. The NOCTS application tracks claimant data and documents, and is thus a central repository for all information related to each claim. The web-based interface allows the application to be accessed by any computer equipped with Internet connection and browser software. The primary goal of NOCTS is to facilitate the processing of claims in an efficient and accurate manner. The application also provides an instrument for effective and timely communications with claimants during this process. Another goal is to establish and maintain interagency communications among all the parties involved in the claims process. <br />1.0 Identify data relevant to reconstructing radiation doses and evaluating SEC petitions <br />1.1 Data collection related to claims and petitions: The contractor will collect all known sources of recorded dosimetry, radiation data, and relevant information applicable to completing dose reconstructions for individual claimants and evaluating SEC petitions for classes of employees. This task will include the following: <br />1.1.1 NIOSH will request from DOE and provide to the contractor individual exposure information for claimants. In coordination with NIOSH and with the cooperation of DOE, the contractor will request from DOE (as necessary) and other entities supplemental information applicable to individual claims or petitions to supplement any such information in the NIOSH claims database. The collection of this information will be conducted under a Memorandum of Understanding that has been established between HHS and DOE (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/ocasdoe.html#mou or <br />http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/pdfs/misc/moudoe.pdf).</p>
<p>1.1.2 The contractor will synthesize information related to dose reconstruction feasibility into Professional Judgment Papers and Petition Evaluation Reports, providing the basis for the feasibility or infeasibility of reconstructing radiation dose. Professional Judgment Papers evaluate the bases provided with the SEC petition to determine if they meet the criteria in 42 CFR 83 for a valid petition, i.e. to determine if the petition qualifies. Petition Evaluation Reports are prepared once petitions are qualified and they evaluate the existing information to determine if it is sufficient to perform dose reconstructions for the proposed class. Additional information about the SEC process and examples of Petition Evaluation Reports can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/ocassec.html.<br />1.1.3 The contractor will maintain a local office in Cincinnati, Ohio to abstract, enter, or migrate necessary information from DOE and other records into the Site Research Database or NIOSH OCAS Claims Tracking System for use in dose reconstructions or other purposes. <br />1.1.4 The contractor will monitor the completeness and timeliness of record/information acquisition from DOE and other sources, inform NIOSH, on a monthly basis, of delays, their causes, and involve NIOSH as necessary to obtain their timely resolution. <br />1.2 Dose reconstruction research: The contractor will research the conditions, processes, practices, and incidents at DOE and AWE facilities relevant to conducting dose reconstructions. This task will include the following: <br />1.2.1 The contractor will review and analyze records from DOE and AWEs, which will be useful to interpret recorded dosimetry information, to evaluate the adequacy and completeness of dosimetry information, and to substitute for unavailable or incomplete dosimetry information. Plans for site visits and the research to be performed during a site visit must be approved by NIOSH. It is likely that 50 site data capture visits may be required each year. <br />1.2.2 With the cooperation of DOE and assistance of worker representatives and others, the contractor will identify and interview current and former DOE/AWE facility line managers, radiation protection personnel, individual workers, and others as appropriate, and analyze the results of these interviews to interpret recorded dosimetry information, to evaluate the adequacy and completeness of dosimetry information, and to substitute for unavailable or incomplete dosimetry information. The extent of these efforts shall be coordinated with and approved by NIOSH prior to initiation of contact with DOE or DOE contractor personnel. <br />1.2.3 As agreed upon between NIOSH and the contractor, the contractor will develop statistical procedures and assumptions based on dose reconstruction research that can be applied in multiple dose reconstructions, including but not limited to dose reconstructions for employees in specific jobs, performing specific tasks, employed in specific facilities or sites, and related to specific time periods of employment. These statistical procedures will include methods to estimate the uncertainty distributions surrounding internal and external dose reconstructions on a facility specific and time-dependent basis. NIOSH will review and approve such procedures and assumptions. Technical information bulletins ORAUT-OTIB-0019 Rev-01, "Analysis of Coworker Bioassay Data for Internal Dose Assignment," and ORAUT-OTIB--0020 Re-03, "Use of Coworker Dosimetry Date for External Dose Assignment," describe these techniques (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/tibsnum.html). <br />1.2.4 The contractor will produce and submit to NIOSH reports summarizing methods, data sources, and findings of research on facilities on a schedule specified by NIOSH as the need for the report is identified. <br />1.2.5 The contractor will research and analyze information pertaining to sites, claims, and dose reconstruction processes in response to questions and technical issues raised about the EEOICPA program by the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health. Results of these efforts will be provided as scheduled by NIOSH. <br />2.0 Claimant Communications<br />2.1 As directed under 42 CFR 82 and consistent with NIOSH technical guides and procedures, conduct, record, transmit to NIOSH, and report to claimants the results of computer assisted telephone interviews (CATIs) with claimants and, as appropriate, with co-workers and other potential witnesses. Three scripts that cover interviews with claimants who are covered employees, survivors, or co-workers have been prepared. They are provided in Attachment C. Since these scripts have been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, any substantive changes will require approval by OMB. NIOSH will provide a usable computerized version of these scripts. The contractor may, however, with review and approval from NIOSH, convert these scripts to a computer program that facilitates more efficient data storage and retrieval. <br />2.2 The contractor will produce and provide for review by the claimant/interviewee reports of interviews, and enter final reports and their elements as a case file into the claims database no less frequently than weekly. <br />2.3 The contractor will obtain and enter into the claimant interview case file and research database additional information as may be provided by the claimant in writing to supplement the claim record. <br />2.4 The contractor will conduct close-out interviews with claimants once they have received their draft dose reconstruction reports in order to answer questions about the dose reconstruction and to explain the next steps in the claim process. <br />2.5 Although not part of the interview process, the contractor must provide a toll free telephone line to address claimants' questions within 30 days of award. This will be in addition to the claimant telephone support service that NIOSH is currently offering. <br />2.6 The contractor will correspond with claimants informing them that their dose reconstruction has been scheduled once all the information necessary to perform the dose reconstruction has been received, but not before. <br />2.7 The contractor will designate a point of contact within its organization who is responsible for resolving issues and answering questions from communications with claimants by either NIOSH or the contractor. This point of contact shall have the organizational authority necessary to resolve issues between sub-organizations within the contractor's organization in order to provide resolutions and answers. <br />2.8 When the contractor receives information from a claimant that affects the normal progress of the claim (e.g., identifies an additional cancer not listed on the claim, provides information that affects the draft dose reconstruction, etc.) the contractor shall notify NIOSH's Claimant Information and Communication Team of the reason for the interruption in claim progress. Information of this nature that is received by NIOSH will be communicated promptly to the contractor. In all cases the contractor will communicate the resolution to the claimant. <br />2.9 Contractor shall provide CATI and close out interview for every claimant for whom a dose reconstruction is performed unless claimant declines to participate. Some claims have multiple claimants, so the number of claimants is larger than the number of dose reconstructions that must be completed. Contractor should plan to complete 1.5 CATIs and close out interviews per dose reconstruction, or 96 CATIs and close out interviews per week.<br />3.0 Dose Estimation and reporting<br />3.1 As directed under 42 CFR Part 82 and consistent with NIOSH Implementation Guides for Internal and External Dose Reconstruction (located at https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/drmethods.html ), and technical information bulletins and procedures (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/ocastbds.html ,<br />http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/ocasppg.html ), the contractor will produce and report timely dose estimates, supporting methodology, and factual basis for each claim received by NIOSH from DOL under EEOICPA and for claims requiring re-work because of changes in claim information or changes in dose reconstruction policy (estimated at 3000 dose reconstructions and re-works annually).</p>
<p>3.2 The contractor will collect and analyze all available information relevant to dose estimation/reconstruction for each individual claim and produce and transmit to NIOSH a draft report providing dose estimates, methods, and the factual basis upon which the doses were estimated, including a narrative explanation of this information understandable by claimants with a high school education. An example dose reconstruction report will be included as an attachment under Section J. <br />3.2.1 Internal and external radiation dose estimates will be calculated for each organ that the claimant presents with a primary cancer. The annual dose to each organ will be calculated from the time of first exposure at a covered facility to the date of cancer diagnosis. As appropriate, a separate dose will be computed for each type of radiation exposure received by the individual, using the exposure types provide for in the NIOSH-Interactive Radio Epidemiological Program (IREP) program. These doses will be reported as equivalent dose using the weighting factors provided in the NIOSH technical guides. As part of NIOSH's ongoing Quality Assurance (QA) program, the contractor may be provided blind test claims on a periodic basis. <br />3.2.2 Internal dose calculations will be performed using standard metabolic models published by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). These calculations will be performed using a NIOSH supplied computer program entitled Integrated Module for Bioassay Analysis (IMBA) or other NIOSH approved programs. IMBA was specially created for NIOSH to perform internal dose calculations using the most recent physiologically based biokinetic models such as those contained in ICRP publications 56, 67, and 69. Inhalation intakes will be evaluated using the respiratory tract model contained in ICRP publication 66. The contractor will not have access to the source code. Any contractor developed software used for calculating internal dose must be approved by NIOSH prior to its use in dose reconstructions and NIOSH must have access to the program and source code. Any contractor purchased software used for calculating internal dose must be approved by NIOSH prior to its use in dose reconstructions. <br />Within 30 days of award, NIOSH will provide training on the IMBA software for key contractor personnel who are not familiar with the software. Within 30 days after receiving training from NIOSH, the contractor will be responsible for providing and documenting training to members of its technical team who will be involved in conducting dose reconstructions and are not already familiar with the software. <br />3.2.3 Estimates of missed dose, due to technical limitations in monitoring technology, will be evaluated and included in the energy employee's dose reconstruction for both internal and external sources of exposure. In addition, any exposure to diagnostic x rays that were required as a condition of employment and that were performed at an EEOICPA-covered facility will be estimated and included in the energy employee's total organ dose. <br />3.3 The contractor will review with NIOSH and revise dose reconstructions, as necessary, subject to NIOSH oversight of the dose reconstruction program. <br />3.4 The contractor will develop statistical procedures and assumptions that may have application for multiple dose reconstructions, including but not limited to dose reconstructions for employees in specific jobs, performing specific tasks, employed in specific facilities or sites, and related to specific time periods of employment. NIOSH will review and approve these procedures and assumptions before they are used to complete dose reconstructions. <br />4.0 Prepare Special Exposure Cohort petition evaluations <br />4.1 In accordance with 42 CFR 83 and procedure OCAS-PR-004, "Internal Procedures for the Evaluation of Special Exposure Cohort Petitions," <br />(http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/secmisc.html) the contractor will process and evaluate petitions received from individuals for the addition of classes to the SEC, and will initiate the addition of classes when there is not adequate information to reconstruct radiation doses with sufficient accuracy. <br />4.2 The contractor will process and evaluate petitions received from individuals for additions of classes to the SEC (the 83.13 process).<br />4.2.1 With the approval of NIOSH, the contractor will communicate with the petition submitter as necessary in order to obtain the information required in 42 CFR 83 for a petition. Some petitions may be sufficient upon initial receipt, but NIOSH expects that every petition will require communication of this type to obtain information required by 42 CFR 83. <br />4.2.2 The contractor will determine whether the information ultimately submitted with a petition meets the requirements in 42 CFR 83 and therefore qualifies for evaluation. Contractor will document the basis for this determination in a professional judgment and submit it to NIOSH.<br />4.2.3 For petitions that qualify for evaluation, the contractor shall provide a list of the types of apparent data deficiencies that could potentially make dose reconstructions infeasible, along with the research efforts that the contractor will pursue to remedy each apparent data deficiency, and shall submit the list to NIOSH for review and approval. The schedule for delivering the list will be established by NIOSH upon qualification of a petition, depending on the complexity of the petition.<br />4.2.4 For petitions that qualify for evaluation, provide a draft professional judgment that includes a preliminary qualification determination based on the petition and supporting documentation received. NIOSH recognizes this may have to be revised based on the petitioner's response. <br />4.2.5 The contractor shall research information relevant to the feasibility of the dose reconstruction for members of the class; reach determinations about the feasibility of reconstructing doses for members of the class and the potential that members of the class were harmed by their exposure; document those determinations in a petition evaluation report; and submit the petition evaluation report to NIOSH for review and approval. The petition evaluation report must be completed and approved by NIOSH within 180 days from the date the petition was originally submitted to NIOSH, not counting days when NIOSH and the contractor are awaiting additional information from the submitter in order to fulfill the petition qualification requirements of 42 CFR 83. <br />4.2.6 The contractor will provide additional research and revision to petition evaluation reports to respond to questions raised by the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health ("the Board"). NIOSH anticipates that every petition evaluation report will prompt questions from the Board. Such questions have required detailed follow-up analysis of complex issues such as monitoring program adequacy, technical performance of internal and external dosimetry systems, and characterization of the radiation fields present at sites being evaluated. <br />4.3 The contractor will identify classes of workers for whom there is inadequate information to perform dose reconstruction with sufficient accuracy, and initiate adding those classes to the SEC (the 83.14 process). <br />4.3.1 The contractor will identify potential classes for whom dose reconstruction is not feasible, and will document the basis for that determination. Classes may comprise any portion of the employees at a covered facility and any portion of the duration of the covered period. The class definition and basis for finding it infeasible to reconstruct radiation doses will be submitted to NIOSH for review and approval.<br />4.3.2 The contractor will propose a representative claimant from each 83.14 class for NIOSH approval. Upon NIOSH approval of a representative claimant, contractor will prepare communications to that claimant about the infeasibility of dose reconstruction and the 83.14 SEC process. <br />4.3.3 The contractor will prepare a petition evaluation report that documents the basis for finding dose reconstruction infeasible for members of the class and submit the petition evaluation report to NIOSH for review and approval.<br />4.3.4 The contractor will provide additional research and revision to petition evaluation reports to respond to questions raised by the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health. NIOSH expects that every petition evaluation report will prompt questions from the Board. <br />4.4 The contractor will produce Basis of Decision documents when petitioners request an Administrative Review of SEC petitions that have completed the review cycle. These documents will detail the processes and evidence used in making key decisions in defining or declining addition of a SEC class.<br />5.0 Technical and program management support <br />5.1 Technical support: Provide information and analyses to NIOSH to review individual dose reconstructions, dose reconstruction procedures and practices, or SEC petition evaluations, or to respond to requests by DOL, the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health, Congress, or other stakeholders, and to support NIOSH management in the dose reconstruction and SEC petition evaluation program. This task will include the following: <br />5.1.1 The contractor will prepare and provide analyses, information and reports to NIOSH in response to reviews of individual dose reconstructions requested by DOL in the adjudication of claims. NIOSH expects four of these requests per year.<br />5.1.2 The contractor will prepare and provide analyses, information, and reports to NIOSH in response to reviews of dose reconstructions, dose reconstruction procedures, technical documents such as technical information bulletins or technical basis documents, or SEC petition evaluations under EEOICPA by the Advisory Board and other external organizations that may conduct scientific or technical reviews, such as the National Academy of Sciences and the Government Accountability Office. NIOSH expects that the Advisory Board will review and comment on 60 dose reconstruction reports, 8 technical basis documents, and 15 procedures and technical information bulletins (combined) each year. Total requests from other bodies is expected to be four per year. <br />5.1.3 The contractor will prepare and provide analyses, information, and reports to NIOSH in support of Congressional briefings and in response to Congressional inquiries. NIOSH expects to request contractor assistance for responding to one Congressional inquiry per week and six briefings per year. Inquiries address individual cases, while briefings address program status and site specific information for a single or few sites (e.g., those from a single state). <br />5.1.4 Within 30 days of award, the contractor will establish practices for using the NIOSH OCAS Claims Tracking System (NOCTS). Any supplementary tracking system established by the contractor must be compatible with and provide current information to NOCTS to support reporting of dose reconstruction process status to claimants. <br />5.1.5 The contractor will provide records to NIOSH such that NIOSH can comply with requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act. NIOSH expects to request contractor assistance in approximately twelve such requests per year.<br />5.2 Program management support: The contractor shall provide comprehensive program management support to NIOSH. This task will include the following: <br />5.2.1 Within 60 days of award, the contractor will develop and implement a written project management plan and submit it to NIOSH for review and approval. The project management plan will define the organizational structure, management approach, requirements, and tools for planning, implementing, and monitoring work practices which will be used to complete radiation dose reconstructions and to evaluate submissions and petitions for the addition of classes to the SEC.<br />5.2.2 Within 90 days of award, the contractor will develop, implement and maintain a written quality assurance program for the overall project. The quality assurance program documentation will describe the organizational structure, functional responsibilities, levels of authority, and interfaces for those personnel managing, performing, and assessing the adequacy of work performed as part of this contract.<br />5.2.3 Within 90 days of award, the contractor will develop and enact procedures for implementing "NIOSH Policy on the Appearance of Bias for the EEOICPA Program &amp; General Conflict of Interest Requirements,"(http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/OCAS/ocascobs.html or <br />https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/pdfs/dr/cobpolicy-r3.pdf ). Copies of those procedures will be provided to NIOSH at that time.</p>

Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.<br /><br />(b) Accordingly, any offeror responding to this solicitation must comply with established HHS EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.hhs.gov/web/508. The complete text of the Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/standards.htm. <br /><br />(c) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this contract are:</p>
<p>205 WCAG 2.0 Level A &amp; AA Success Criteria<br />302 Functional Performance Criteria<br />502 Inoperability with Assistive Technology<br />504 Authoring Tools<br />602 Support Documentation<br />603 Support Services<br /><br />In order to facilitate the Government's determination whether proposed EIT supplies meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must submit an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining whether proposed EIT supplies conform to applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows offerors or developers to self-evaluate their supplies and documentation detail - whether they conform to a specific Section 508 accessibility standard, and any underway remediation efforts addressing conformance issues. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Evaluation Template are available under Section 508 policy on the HHS Web site http://hhs.gov/web/508. <br /><br />In order to facilitate the Government's determination whether proposed EIT services meet applicable Section /508 accessibility standards, offerors must provide enough information to assist the Government in determining that the EIT services conform to Section 508 accessibility standards, including any underway remediation efforts addressing conformance issues.<br /><br />(d) Respondents to this solicitation must identify any exception to Section 508 requirements. If a offeror claims its supplies or services meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and it is later determined by the Government, i.e., after award of a contract or order, that supplies or services delivered do not conform to the accessibility standards, remediation of the supplies or services to the level of conformance specified in the contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its expense.</p>

<p>PII means information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. OMB Circular A-130, Managing Information as a Strategic Resource (July 28, 2016). Examples of PII include, but are not limited to the following: social security number, date and place of birth, mother`s maiden name, biometric records, etc.</p>
<p>The E-Government Act of 2002 Section 208 (E-Government Act) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-03-22, Guidance for Implementing the Privacy Provisions of the E-Government of 2002, form the core of the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) requirement. Together, they state that a PIA is an assessment of how information is handled within certain electronic systems. Each PIA should consider: 1) Whether the system complies with legal, regulatory, and policy requirements related to privacy; 2) The risks and effects of how that system handles personally identifiable information (PII); and 3) How the system could be changed to mitigate potential privacy risks. The Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) has chosen to evaluate the privacy implications of all electronic systems regardless of whether the E-Government<br />Act or OMB M-03-22 requires a PIA.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of Commercial Space Transportation (AST), contemplates issuing a screening information request (SIR) in order to meet the requirement for expert consultative support for AST’s Environmental Review Program.  Support services include:
•	Review and comment on license, permit, and grant applications submitted to AST for compliance with applicable environmental laws, including National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), national and agency policy;
•	Review and comment on rules developed by AST for compliance with applicable environmental laws, including NEPA, national and agency policy;
•	Conduct environmental studies and analyses related to the environmental effects of space launches and reentries;
•	Support agency coordination and stakeholder involvement for environmental and licensing reviews through the development of standard operation procedures, guidance documents, and outreach and communication strategies.
FAA/AST anticipates awarding a one-year, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract with up to four one-year extension options.

The FAA seeks to determine which vendors are both interested in and capable of providing support services.  

The principle North American Industry Classification Systems Code is 541620.

The purpose of this market survey is to encourage statements of interest and capabilities from business concerns, including small businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Small Business Administration 8(a) certified firms and other small business concerns capable of providing the required support services.  The survey will also assist FAA/AST with determining the extent of competition and procurement strategy.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires capability statements from interested vendors.  Capability statements should include:
•	A statement of your firm’s experience within the past 10 years in providing client support to ensure compliance with NEPA and other relevant environmental regulations and policies
•	A statement of your firm’s experience within the past 10 years in supporting Federal agencies in the review of NEPA-related environmental documents such as Environmental Impact Statements and Environmental Assessments that pertain to launch and reentry operations
•	A statement of your firm’s experience within the past 10 years in supporting Federal agencies in the development of Environmental Assessments and Written Re-Evaluations that pertain to launch and reentry operations
•	A statement of your firm’s experience within the past 10 years with FAA Order 1050.1 F, Environmental Impacts: Policies and Procedures
•	A statement of your firm’s experience within the past 10 years with FAA Order 5050.4B, NEPA Implementing Instructions for Airport Actions
•	A statement of your firm’s experience within the past 10 years with the commercial space launch industry and its unique environmental issues and concerns.  Specifically, highlight your firm’s ability to analyze noise impacts from launch vehicle operations.
•	A statement of your firm’s experience within the past 10 years coordinating with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and/or Department of Defense to support the development of NEPA-related documentation
•	A statement of your firm’s experience within the past 10 years conducting environmental studies and analysis related to the environmental effects of space launch and reentries
•	A statement of your firm’s experience within the past 10 years supporting Federal agencies with coordination and stakeholder involvement for environmental and licensing/permitting actions 
•	A sample of representative resumes of key personnel available for work on this support effort
•	A declaration that your firm would not support any applicant for licensing or permitting by FAA/AST that would result in a conflict of interest with the required support services.  For example, a vendor could not enter into any agreement to provide NEPA compliance services to any applicant for licensing or permitting by FAA/AST
Vendors are also requested to complete the attached Business Declaration.
All responses to this market survey should be received by 2:00pm Eastern Time, December 7, 2018.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate on an other than full and open competition basis with Becton, Dickinson and Co., USBDB Service Contract Administration, 2350 Qume Drive, San Jose, CA, 95131 a service contract renewal for various models of lasers that is specifically designed to use with BD Biosciences FACSAria and High Throughput Sampler flow cytometers. All lasers models include the following: 1) Sapphire 488-100 Blue Lsr #640100, NO-SERIAL-2827, 2) COHR Compass Green 315M-150 Lsr, #640102, NO-SERIAL-2828, 3) MPB 628-200 Red Laser, #660881, NO-SERIAL-8165, 4) Laser Violet 405-100, #647316, NO-SERIAL-2830, 5) Sapphire 488-100 Blue Lsr, #640100, NO-SERIAL-6024, 6) Laser Violet 405-100, #647316, NO-SERIAL-6026, 7) COHR Compass Green 315M-150 Lsr, #640102, NO-SERIAL-6025, and 8) MPB 628-200 Red Laser, #660881, NO-SERIAL-6027. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR Part 13.501(a)(1).
<p><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm-fixed price type of contract.</p>
<p>Period of performance is for one (1) year starting January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019. Service shall be performed in Bethesda, MD 20892.</p>
<p>The Vaccine Research Center requires a service agreement renewal for various models of lasers specifically designed to be used with FACSAria and High Throughput Sampler flow cytometers. The lasers must be compatible with existing equipment and no substitutions are allowed. As the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) Becton, Dickinson and Co., deems necessary to maintain the equipment in accordance with their required specifications without the lasers the above reference instruments will be rendered non-functional. There are no known lasers offered that will physically fit inside the instruments to provide the optimal signal strength and power to accommodate the functioning of the instrument. To use a different vendor for these lasers will cause the instruments to not be able to be calibrated to optimal specifications such that samples between experiments will not be able to be analyzed and compared. This would adversely affect the function of the lab and its mission.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source requirement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 only one source available, no substitutions possible. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. All responsible sources who can provide the required service agreement renewal may submit a response that could be considered by email (subject line to reference NIAID-NOI-19-1939605) to Tonia Alexander at talexander@niaid.nih.gov, by 10:00 am eastern standard time Monday, December 3, 2018. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NIAID to determine if it can meet the above specifications described herein. All responses received by the closing date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC><strong>Acquisition Authority:</strong> This acquisition is being conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and the resultant contract award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-101 / 10-26-2018.<br /><strong><br />Set-aside Status:</strong> No set-aside restriction is applicable.<br /><br /><strong>Competition Status:</strong> This requirement is posted as non-competitive.<br /><br /><strong>Non-Competitive (Single-sole Source (Including brand-name)) Determination:</strong> This notice of proposed acquisition is posted as an intent to award a purchase order on a non-competitive basis to Kamtek, Inc., at 4851 International Blvd., Frederick, MD 21073. The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted specifically producing no other sources of supply or service capable of achieving this Government requirement.<br /><br /><strong>Description of Requirement:</strong> The purpose of this acquisition is to maintain the storage of nine (9) ultra-low freezers and 600 cubic feet of storage space in walk-in cold room at an off-site facility. An off-site facility is needed due to lack of on-site storage space at NCATS. Storage service must provide storage space, 24/7 Rees alarm monitoring and an annual preventive maintenance calibration for each unit. This is necessary because appropriate cold storage at -20C is essential for ongoing projects. The storage facility must be local and readily accessible, creating ease-of-access to stored samples only needed periodically.<br /><br />It is in the Government's best interest to have the compounds and freezers in one location and to remain at Kamtek Inc. Transporting the contents to a different facility would not only be cost-prohibitive, but would risk the integrity of the samples as they must be maintained at a specific temperature to avoid degradation due to thawing and refreezing.<br /><br />The total Period of Performance is January 8, 2019 through December 31, 2020. This includes one base period from January 8, 2019 through December 31, 2019, and one option period from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020.<br /><br /><strong>Summary Statement: </strong>This notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals or quotations.

All respondents must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />All responses to this pre-solicitation notice must be received no later than 12:00pm EST on Thursday, December 6, 2018 and must reference the announcement number specified above.<br /><br />Responses may be submitted electronically to Kimberly Espinosa at kimberly.espinosa@nih.gov.

<DESC>Veterans  Health Administration, Network Contracting Office 5, is issuing this request for information/sources sought notice to identify sources that have the resources and capabilities to provide an Employee Health & Well-Being Monthly Newsletter designed to help all VHA employees lead healthier, more productive lives.  
SERVICES REQUIRED
The Veterans Health Administration Employee Health & Well-Being (EHW) Program is designed to help all VHA employees lead healthier, more productive lives. The EHW program does this by providing education, information, tools and opportunities to help employees improve their health and deal with personal problems that might adversely impact their work performance, health, and well-being. 
The EHW Program provides information on health-related topics through a variety of media, such as conferences, calls, bulletin boards, videos and a variety of classes. Literature shows that one of the most successful methods of providing information on a variety of health-related topics is a monthly newsletter.  Newsletters are written to educate, motivate and produce behavior change.

<p>3. Classification Code: 6640</p>
<p>4. NAICS Code: 423450</p>
<p>5. Description: This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.

No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>6. Background: Two key elements of high throughput screening are the dispensing of reagents into plates and also the quantification of biological samples through measurement using a microplate based detection system. A critical piece of equipment used at NCATS to dispense reagents into microplates is the BioRapTR dispenser, and a critical piece of equipment used at NCATS to make measurements of samples within microplates is the ViewLux plate reader. In the recent past Beckman Coulter has decided to discontinue the BioRapTR from production. Perkin Elmer also no longer manufactures the ViewLux equipment. <br />The Tox21 Robotic Screening system also utilizes an automated ViewLux plate reader. This is a critical piece of equipment and they have been known to fail. Currently the previous backup ViewLux is no longer available for use due to a failure in another lab, leaving the Tox21 group vulnerable to delays and not reaching critical delivery milestones of scientific data in the event of another ViewLux failure without a replacement being readily available.</p>
<p>7. Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this requirement is to acquire for NCATS three (3) used BioRapTRs and one (1) used ViewLux. It is critical that NCATS' purchase these units as backups to the existing BioRapTRs and ViewLuxs; NCATS performs numerous High Throughput Assays annually and is concerned that repair parts will start getting harder to obtain.</p>
<p>8. Project requirements: Capabilities and specifications for the required equipment is as follows:</p>
<p>Beckman Coulter BioRAPTR FRD <br />Included in this package are Dell computers, software, and ancillary spare parts, including 2 extra dispense heads.<br />Qty: 3</p>
<p>Perkin Elmer ViewLux 1430 Ultra HTS<br />Included is basic instrument unit without computer or chiller, which will be parted out, and all the critical valuable parts <br />Qty: 1</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:<br />DISCLOSURE:<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) notice only. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and a formal solicitation is not available at this time. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government to issue an RFP, contract, or order.
<p>This RFI is for informational planning purposes and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any actual procurement of materials, machinery, or services. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The Government will not pay for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement. All costs associated with responding to this RFI are solely at the responding parties' expense.</p>
<p>This RFI is open to all interested parties both foreign and domestic, but the boat must be built in the United States. Should an RFP for production be issued, boat designs which originate outside the U.S. are permitted as long as the prime contractor can meet all domestic United States manufacturing and solicitation requirements.</p>
<p>Respondents are solely responsible for properly marking and clearly identifying any proprietary information or trade secrets contained within their response. The Government will not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly marked and clearly identified. Proprietary information received in response to this RFI will be safeguarded and handled in accordance with applicable Government regulations.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued. Specific responses to the approaches will not disqualify or have an impact on participation and evaluation on future solicitations.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:<br />The overall objective of this RFI is to provide industry and interested parties with information that will assist in the understanding of current technical requirements for a potential 7m RIB Government Design. No specific information is required in response to this RFI; however, interested parties may respond and indicate interest as desired.</p>
<p>The Navy plans to award a multi-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract in FY20 for an estimated total of two hundred and fifty (250) 7m RIBs in which the Government will provide the Technical Data Package (TDP) consisting of Contract Drawings and Specifications. This potential contract will include three (3) variants;<br />1. Standard 7m RIB<br />2. LPD-17 7m variant<br />3. SOLAS Rescue Boat 7m variant</p>
<p>The notional schedule listed below is provided for planning purposes only. The Government is not obligated to pursue this schedule or a future solicitation because of this RFI.</p>
<p>1. Release draft RFP 3rd QTR FY19. <br />2. Release final RFP 4th QTR FY19.</p>
<p>Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:<br />The primary mission of the 7m RIBs is to serve as the Ready Service Life Boat on USS Navy Ship's. The RIBs are multi-purpose platforms with several secondary missions, including Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) operations, Search and Rescue (SAR) operations and Vessel Boarding, Search and Seizure (VBSS) and Maritime Interdiction Operations (MIO).</p>
<p>One of the operational requirements for shipboard RIBs is that each boat must be carried aboard and deployed from its mother ship. In order to meet the deployment requirement, each boat must be compatible (within weight limitations) with existing shipboard handling (launch and retrieval) and stowage systems (davits).</p>
<p>In addition to the standard 7m RIB single point (four leg) soft sling hoisting system (rated for 5,600 lb.), the 7mRX (LPD-17 variant) is also equipped with a single point lift frame with a Cranston Eagle hook that interfaces to the Positive Control Derrick Head (PCDH) used on the LPD-17's Allied crane and Caley davit systems. The PCDH interface minimizes the need for line handlers and enables the crew to significantly reduce boat launch and retrieval times on LPD-17 Class ships.</p>
<p>The Navy is also pursuing a US Coast Guard Approved SOLAS 7m Rescue Boat that complies with 46 CFR 160.156 (which incorporates SOLAS/Life Saving Appliance code design and testing requirements). The SOLAS Rescue Boat will be the standard rescue boat outfitted on Military Sealift Command (MSC) vessels which carry USCG Certificate of Inspections (COI), and are subject to the SOLAS requirement to carry an approved Rescue Boat. To maximize commonality, the TDP for the SOLAS rescue boat will be a variant of the Std 7M RIB and as similar as possible while still meeting SOLAS requirements. The Navy is currently planning on having a pre-approval review of the SOLAS Rescue Boat TDP conducted by the USCG prior to issuance of an RFP. With this approved in principle TDP, the contractor will be responsible for construction, prototype testing, and delivery to the Navy the USCG Certificate of Approval for the SOLAS Rescue Boat. It is anticipated that the Certificate of approval will be issued with the US Navy as the approval holder, and the builder being listed as an approved factory location. This is not intended to limit the builder's ability to use the SOLAS TDP for other commercial non-navy business opportunities. It is also anticipated that the USCG and Navy will retain all plan review, testing and construction oversight, with no involvement of an independent laboratory.</p>

<DESC>This RFI is issued for market research purposes only. The purpose of this notice is twofold:<br /><br />1.	Identify U.S. small business concerns having an interest in and capability to provide support for INL/WHP programs. Responses to this notice will be considered in selecting the acquisition strategy and to determine the appropriateness of setting aside Functional Areas (FAs) of the IDIQ for any one of the small business programs described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19.<br /><br />2.	Obtain industry feedback on the proposed acquisition strategy to include, but not limited to: IDIQ contract ceiling, composition of FAs, proposed number of awards per FA, and existing contract vehicles that the Department may leverage to meet INL/WHP requirements.<br /><br />All information contained in this notice is preliminary in nature and is subject to change. This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), Request for Quotations (RFQ), Invitation for Bids (IFB), or a commitment on the part of the government to conduct a solicitation in the future. All information provided is strictly voluntary and no reimbursement will be made by the Government for any costs associated with providing a response to this notice or otherwise participating in market research activities. Further, the US Department of State offers no assurance that a solicitation will result from this notice.<br /><br />Any information submitted will become the property of the Government and will not be returned. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and must be clearly marked.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND</span></strong>
<p>The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) leads the Department of State's anticrime and counter-narcotics efforts. INL assistance programs help partner nations to build their capacities to extend the reach of justice under the rule of law, including respect for human rights and gender equality, and to deny safe haven to criminals who would otherwise operate with near impunity.<br /><br />INL delivers technical assistance and capacity to: enhance international drug control through interdiction and supply reduction; develop civilian law enforcement capacity, regional partnerships, and information sharing; and further the administration of justice and corrections under the rule of law with respect for human rights. INL's programs seek to oppose and counter illicit drug production and demand; drug, wildlife and human trafficking; corruption; cybercrime; intellectual property rights (IPR) fraud; transnational organized crime; environmental crime; crimes that threaten civilian security; crimes against women; and activities using the proceeds of crime.</p>
<p><br />INL's anticrime programs seek to improve and support key components of the criminal justice system such as gendarmerie, police, customs and border officials, investigators, judges, courts, prosecutors, defense attorneys, civil society organizations, and the corrections system. INL also plays a significant role in front line U.S. foreign policy priority countries in transition by assisting in strengthening internal security and governance under the rule of law.</p>
<p><br />The nimble, fluid nature of international crime needs to be addressed through a variety of tools, both programmatic and diplomatic. Criminal networks are constantly evolving and changing their activities in response to operational threats. New competitors enter the crime market with different ideas and ways of operating as others are arrested, neutralized, or removed. As the law enforcement communities' anti-crime techniques improve, criminals evolve their techniques to make use of new technologies and alter and expand their modes of criminality, especially in the commission of cybercrime, financial crime, and the smuggling of drugs, weapons and humans. Often, a lack of sufficient and appropriate resources, combined with host governments' limited infrastructure and capacity to support and maintain the newest technological advancements and equipment, severely hinder the ability to immediately and effectively counter criminal networks.</p>
<p><br />The threats and challenges INL faces are often regional, and therefore, the solutions should be regional. Many of the challenges and criminal networks faced by INL and its partners in the Western Hemisphere are interrelated and similar in nature. Additionally, many INL partners in the region share a common language, possess a similar culture, and face similar constraints in meeting the aforementioned challenges. Moreover, historically there has been a high degree of cooperation between INL programs in the region.</p>
<p><br />In order to meet its objectives, INL/WHP requires flexible and timely acquisition support. This proposed multiple-award Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract aims to establish a streamlined approach to successfully meeting INL/WHP's acquisition requirements, while maintaining the public's trust and fulfilling public policy objectives.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROPOSED CONTRACT STRUCTURE</span></strong></p>
<p><br />The Department aims to establish approximately three (3) IDIQ contracts per each of the following FAs. The cumulative program ceiling is expected to be approximately $500 million for the 66-month effective period of the contracts (5-year base plus a 6-month option).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull;	FA 1: Training Services<br />&bull;	FA 2: IT Services<br />&bull;	FA 3: IT and Communications Systems<br />&bull;	FA 4: Operations, Logistics, and Facilities Support Services<br />&bull;	FA 5: Forensics and Non-Intrusive Inspection Equipment<br />&bull;	FA 6: Vehicles<br />&bull;	FA 7: Watercraft<br /><br />The FAs were selected to comply with the requirements of 13 CFR &sect;121.402(c). While we acknowledge certain overlap between the FAs, each order awarded under the IDIQ contracts will be assigned the single NAICS code that best describes the principal purpose of the goods or services to be acquired. This NAICS code selection will determine under which FA the order will be awarded. Only companies awarded an IDIQ contract under that FA will be eligible for award. Companies may participate and be awarded contracts under more than one FA.</p>
<p><br />Refer to Appendix A for a list of proposed FAs, associated NAICS codes, small business size standards, and examples of task required under each FA.</p>
<p><br />Companies may be required to provide services in the language of the INL partner nation. Additionally, all products may require local warranty, maintenance, and support. The use of simultaneous translators and/or US-based warranty and technical services may not meet INL/WHP requirements.</p>
<p><br />While we acknowledge there are multiple companies with generic capabilities under each FA, we are particularly interested in companies having said capabilities <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span></strong> implementation experience in programs similar to INL/WHP programs.<br /><br />Work under the IDIQs will require performance overseas. Additionally, performance may be required in remote and non-permissive locations. USG logistical and other support will be kept to a minimum.<br /><br />Given the nature of the required work, the Department reserves the right to require offerors to possess a facility security clearance and its personnel to possess a security clearance (American Citizen and Third Country Nationals) or a Regional Security Office (RSO) background investigation (Local Nationals).<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NON-MANUFACTURER RULE (NMR)<br /></span></strong><br />For those FAs for which a manufacturing NAICS code has been assigned small business are reminded that, unless the SBA has granted a class waiver of the NMR for the particular product, the company will be required to be either the manufacturer of the products offered or qualify for the procurement as a "nonmanufacturer".</p>
<p><br />In accordance with FAR 19.102(f), the applicable size standard for a "nonmanufacturer" is 500 employees.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESPONSE</span></strong></p>
<p><br />Prospective offerors interested in responding to this notice should submit information electronically to Weakley-LugoKF@state.gov and FernandezJM@state.gov no later than April 4, 2018 at 10:00 am EST.</p>
<p><br />The Government will only consider responses submitted in the Appendix B format. Given the interest expected, the required format is required to facilitate with the efficient analysis of responses. Responses providing partial information may not be considered by the Government.</p>
<p><br />Telephone inquiries will not be accepted nor acknowledged. Questions, if any, must be directed via email to Weakley-LugoKF@state.gov and FernandezJM@state.gov.</p>
<p><br />Individual feedback or evaluations will be not be provided to companies regarding their submissions.</p>
<p><br />The Government reverses the right to conduct one-on-one interviews with any of the respondents to this notice. Depending on the number of responses received one-on-one interviews may not be conducted with each respondent.</p>

<p>NAICS Code: 334 -- Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing/334290 -- Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing Synopsis:</p>
<p>Commercial Item Description NAICS 334290 - Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis. This announcement seeks information from industry, which will be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. This is Not a Solicitation for proposals and No Contract shall be awarded from this synopsis.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville is soliciting comments on a market research basis for IP Camera evaluations. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests. It should be noted that we are looking for equipment manufacturers only.</p>
<p>In order to better serve our customers, we look for ways to improve on existing ESS systems.</p>
<p>The Sources Sought is to solicit input from manufactures about IP Cameras in accordance with the attached Functional Requirements Document (FRD), which will be used to protect various assets within the Army enterprise. The IP Cameras must meet all requirements of the FRD and be fully compliant with current Federal Government cybersecurity policies and requirements (including meeting Country of Origin (COO) and Trade Agreements Act (TAA) requirements) for all components.</p>
<p>We have provided information about the IP Cameras sought for evaluation which outlines the equipment's components, features and functions. We have also provided an excel file matrix which lists each of the individual paragraphs and provides a space for comments beside each of them. Vendors should complete the matrix in full and clearly provide, in the comments section, whether the equipment is currently compliant. Only the equipment's existing capabilities, features and functions should be submitted, not planned product improvements. We are asking that comments be made so that the point of contact listed below can fully evaluate the response for each of the items provided in the excel file.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that we need complete responses to all of the requirements listed in the matrix in order to better evaluate the product. Incomplete responses will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>Responses will be evaluated against the requirements of the FRD by the USACE evaluation team. Those vendors whose responses indicate that the IP cameras are compliant will then be requested to submit two (2) fully functional IP cameras of each model to be evaluated. The USACE evaluation team will then perform:</p>
<p>&bull; Preliminary Cybersecurity Testing of the equipment submitted,<br />&bull; Full Functional Testing of the equipment submitted,<br />&bull; Integration Testing of the equipment submitted.</p>
<p>All tested IP cameras will be given internal evaluation scores for compliance. Up to three (3) of those IP cameras that have the highest evaluation scores will be selected and, upon completion of final Cybersecurity Testing and receipt of an Authority To Operate (ATO), will be used on various Electronic Security Systems (ESS) Projects.</p>
<p>All vendor submissions are due 9:00 AM (Central Time), Friday December 07, 2018 and shall be submitted to Project Engineer, Daryl Britton, at Daryl.W.Britton@usace.army.mil and Contract Specialist, Robert Starkey, at robert.starkey@usace.army.mil and ESS-Proposals@usace.army.mil.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis #: FA8601-19-R-0010<br />Notice Type: Special Notice<br /><br />Synopsis:<br /><br />The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Base Support Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of a Diverse Wavelength Ring Laser for the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT/ENP) located at Wright-Patterson AFB. The reason for lack of competition is that M Squared Lasers' Diverse Wavelength Ring Laser is the only equipment available that is able to meet all of AFIT's minimum requirements listed in the statement of work. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(ii).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing and FSC code 6650 - Optical Instruments. Business size standard for NAICS 334516 is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>The proposed source is M Squared Lasers INC. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract regardless of responses that may be received to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources or authorized distributors may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by Wednesday, 28 November 2018 by 10:00 am EST and meets all the following requirements:</p>
<p>Minimum requirements: <br /><br />(1) Power: The core titanium sapphire ring laser must achieve at least 4 Watts of peak output power between wavelengths of 700-1,000 nm, and at least 100 mWatts of peak power between 515-660 nm range, at least 50 mWatts of peak power between 302-347 nm range, at least 1 W of peak power in the 350-500 nm range, and at least 10 mWatts in the 210-250 nm range.<br />(2) Size: The system must be compact to allow for additional equipment in the operational environment - the core titanium sapphire ring laser should be smaller than 30 x 18 x 10 cm. <br />(3) Environment Immunity: The core titanium sapphire ring laser must be hermetically sealed to prevent dust from entering the cavity while simultaneously allowing for purge times of less than 10 minutes. <br />(4) Robustness: The core titanium sapphire ring laser surviving environment trauma (for example, drops from heights of at least 1 m, extreme vibration, or similar) must be demonstrated.<br />(5) Demonstrated Performance: A list of existing customers using the ring laser system must be provided with contact information to demonstrate prior performance.<br />(6) Remote Operation: The core titanium sapphire ring laser must have no manually adjustable parts that require human intervention while still being fully tunable from 700 to 1,000 nm with software development kits available in LabView and Python.<br />(7) Scanning Parameters: The core titanium sapphire ring laser must have scan rates of up to 200 GHz/sec with mode-hop free wavelength scanning over 5 nm with up to 10 kHz resolution in less than 10 minutes. High resolution single scan widths must be at least 25 GHz wide.<br />(8) Amplitude Noise: The core titanium sapphire ring laser must have an amplitude noise of 0.1% RMS or better.<br />(9) Linewidth: The core titanium sapphire ring laser must have an absolute linewidth of 50 KHz or better.<br />(10) Wavelength Access: Additional modules must allow for tunability over the spectral ranges of 210-250 nm, 302-347 nm, 350-500 nm, 515-660 nm, and 700-1,000 nm.<br />(11) Visible Frequency Doubling Mechanism: The core titanium sapphire ring laser must be coupled to a visible frequency doubled for the range of 350-500 nm and must achieve at least 35% conversion efficiency. The frequency doubling cavity must not need temperature control. <br />(12) Pump Source: The laser system must include a single mode Verdi V18 as the pump source to support mixing modules.<br />(13) Chillers: The laser system must include any chillers needed to support all normal operations.<br />(14) Mixing sources: The laser system must include all pump sources required for mixing to achieve all tunable ranges. <br />(15) Wavemeter: The laser system must give a wavelength reference using a wavemeter for fast feedback of the laser output with resolution and sample speed equal to or better than a High Finesse WS-6. The wavemeter must also include all optics for coupling and integrate with the ring laser control software to support wavelength estimates for all tunable wavelength ranges listed. <br />(16) Laser Dye: The laser system must not contain or require any laser dye or laser dye medium for operation at any wavelength.<br />(17) Control System: The laser system must include all hardware, firmware, software, and computer systems needed for operation.<br />(18) Documentation: Full documentation for maintaining, operating, and repairing the laser system, including all control software, must be included. <br />(19) Updates: Future software updates will be made available to AFIT as they become available free of additional charges.<br />(20) Installation &amp; Training: The complete laser system must be installed in AFIT's laboratory and the manufacturer must provide hands on training for all operation and maintenance of the laser system (for example, the training traditionally given to new field technicians). A complete user guide for all operations must be included. A complete maintenance manual for all repairs must be included.</p>
<p>Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br /><br />In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: M Squared Lasers INC. provides the only Diverse Wavelength Ring Laser capable of satisfying the full list of the Government's requirements. Other vendors provided their Diverse Wavelength Ring Laser capabilities during the market research phase, but none could meet all of the technical requirements.<br /><br />The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM at 866-606-8220. SAM website: www.SAM.gov<br /><br />Any information should be e-mailed to hannah.wood.3@us.af.mil no later than 10:00 am EST on Wednesday, 28 November 2018. Only inquiries/Information received by this date and time will be considered.<br /><br />Be advised that all correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "FA8601-19-R-0010 Diverse Wavelength Ring Laser". Note that email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter emails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the email may not get through the email filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. If sending attachments with email ensure only .pdf, .doc, or .xls documents are sent. The email filter may delete any other form of attachments.</p>

<DESC>N0016419SNB26 - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/SOURCES SOUGHT - RADIATION TEST EQUIPMENT - FLASH X-RAY AND PULSED HIGH DOSE-RATE GAMMA IRRADIATION FACILITIES - FSC 6635 - NAICS 334517
<p>Issue Date: 21 NOV 2018 - Closing Date: 03 DEC 2018 - 10:00 AM EDT</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) - The Government is issuing this RFI/Sources Sought Notice as part of market research for two prompt dose rate nuclear radiation environment simulators at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, (NSWC Crane) located at Naval Support Activity (NSA), Crane, Indiana. This RFI/Sources Sought Notice is for the purpose of determining industry sources capable of producing these systems.</p>
<p>NSWC Crane currently operates an electron linear accelerator (LINAC) to perform high dose-rate testing; however, there is interest in supplemental capability that will contain modern components, such as solid state electronics, to be capable of performing radiation effects testing long into the future. The plan involves two phases: (1) a production-level machine for current operations and; (2) a novel irradiator capable of higher dose rates and shorter pulse widths. The first, called a Flash X-Ray (FXR) is used at many other facilities to understand piece part-, assembly-, and system-level ionizing dose survivability. It is intended that this device, which has a high technology readiness level (TRL), will be the main capability of NSWC Crane's radiation testing group in the near future. However, there is interest from the strategic community to reach higher ionizing dose-rates at shorter pulse widths. It is for this reason that NSWC Crane is interested in reaching these expanded requirement sets via the second phase.</p>
<p>For the first phase, the FXR should be capable of installation in a room that is 44 feet long by 12 feet wide by 9 feet tall with access for maintenance. FXR control computers with installed control software should be included. The software should be able to control and monitor all FXR systems. In addition to the FXR control software, a user room computer, able to monitor beam outputs and request beam characteristics modifications, should be provided.</p>
<p>Safe operation of the FXR is paramount, so a shielding plan must be developed and executed using modular, mobile blocks and be compliant with local building codes, safety, and facility requirements.  Once it has been approved by the appropriate Navy Radiation Safety Office (RSO) personnel, this plan must be implemented along with providing all necessary environmental monitoring data validating the efficacy of the shielding plan.  Appropriate training and necessary operation and maintenance manuals must be provided to the end user, as well.</p>
<p>For the second phase, a next-generation irradiator is desired. Like the FXR, it must be capable of installation in a room that is 44 feet long by 12 feet wide by 9 feet tall with access for maintenance.  The control computers with installed control software should be included. The software should be able to control and monitor all systems. In addition to the control software, a user room computer, able to monitor beam outputs and request beam characteristics modifications, should be provided.  All required shielding plans and documentation must also be developed and executed in compliance with local building codes, safety, and facility requirements. Appropriate training and necessary operation and maintenance manuals should be provided to the end user, as well.</p>
<p>Finally, it is expected that this facility will be used for many years, so regular maintenance will be required to ensure safe, reliable operation. Aspects of this maintenance may include, but is not limited to:<br />&bull;	Preventative actions, such as oil cycling/replacement and vacuum seal replacement;<br />&bull;	Acute issue resolution, such as replacement of faulty circuit card assemblies; and<br />&bull;	"Future-proofing" activities, such as control computer refreshes to new technology.<br />All interested parties may submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than 20 pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters, production history, estimated completion schedule with projected risks identified, a statement of current availability, summary of prior experience, test reports, draft Statement of work, and a budgetary estimate. The Government may contact RFI respondents to get clarification on the information submitted.</p>
<p>The Government does not anticipate providing any formal responses to comments/questions received, but may utilize this information to improve planning and documentation efforts.</p>
<p>Responses to this market survey shall include the following:</p>
<p>Submitter's Name<br />Street Address, City, State, Zip Code<br />Business Size and CAGE Code<br />POC Telephone<br />Announcement Number:  N0016419SNB26</p>
<p>Responders must be properly registered in the Government's System for Award Management (SAM) database.  Responders may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation of requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220, or via the internet at http://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>This RFI/Sources Sought Notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this notice.  Any costs incurred by interested parties in response to this notice will NOT be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Responses shall NOT include any classified information.  If any part of a potential response is classified, the Government POC shall first be contacted to coordinate proper submittal. All information marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-Government personnel and entities</p>
<p>Information may be submitted to the Point of Contact (POC) any time prior to the expiration of this announcement.  The POC for this effort is Mr. Jordan Arford, telephone 812-854-5703 and e-mail: jordan.arford@navy.mil.</p>

<SUBJECT>Low Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEAP) Clearinghouse
<SOLNBR>01-OCS-18-11-21
<RESPDATE>120618
<CONTACT>Peter D. Preston, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014435100, Email Peter.Preston@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">The Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate a contract with The National Center for Appropriate Technology located in Butte, Montana on a sole source basis for the Administration of Children and Families (ACF) Office of Community Services (OCS) for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. The acquisition is for a permanent contract for a 60-month period.<br /><br />&bull; Purpose of the Acquisition:<br /><br />The purpose of the acquisition is to maintain the Office of Community Services' (OCS') capacity to provide seamless and timely LIHEAP- related tools and services for the public-particularly people seeking to apply for program benefits-to connect with local intake offices, understand how to apply and what they might be eligible for, and answer other related program questions.<br /><br />&bull; Project description:<br /><br />The Contractor shall maintain the LIHEAP Clearinghouse, which: (1) collects and organizes information online regarding LIHEAP administration across states, tribes and territories-- including current energy issues and trends, related low income energy assistance programs, complementary programs that affect LIHEAP- eligible clients, and other areas of interest to LIHEAP grantees; (2) disseminates such information to grantees and the public; (3) maintains a network of peer mentors for grantees; and (4) offers a referral hotline for members of the general public who are interested in applying for assistance. The hotline is a particularly time sensitive service for households that are in a home energy crisis situation, such as a home heat disconnection during winter.<br /><br />&bull; Objectives of the Acquisition:<br /><br />The objectives of the acquisition are to procure the following:<br /><br />1. Maintain operation of the LIHEAP Clearinghouse website which provides LIHEAP technical assistance information, particularly on program eligibility requirements and available benefits;<br /><br />2. Continue operating the "NEAR" telephone hotline for the public to learn how and where to apply for LIHEAP benefits;<br /><br />3. Collect and report on program inquiries and lessons learned;<br /><br />4. Update key internal resource documents;<br /><br />5. Prepare program-related reports;<br /><br />6. Prepare electronic bulletins to the field;<br /><br />7. Participate in conferences to provide technical assistance;<br /><br />8. Conduct focus groups of grantees;<br /><br />9. Carry out peer-to-peer mentoring among grantees; and,<br /><br />10. Refer concerns, tips, and complaints about suspected waste, fraud and abuse in the program to the appropriate local, state/tribal/territory, and federal authorities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">OHS carefully analyzed the current services to determine whether the current work could be accomplished through another method. The analysis indicated that the current contractor is uniquely knowledgeable and staffed to provide interim services in the specific areas identified. Transitioning to a new contractor for interim support will result in a lapse in service and unacceptable risk to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is recommended that this acquisition be awarded to The National Center for Appropriate Technology (NCAT) without competition, under 6.302-1 of the FAR, for the following reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&bull; The proposed acquisition is an extension of services of the existing LIHEAP Clearinghouse currently operated by NCAT.<br /><br />&bull; These tasks are essential to HHS' successful and timely management of LIHEAP without any gap in public facing services during the peak timing of the program, e.g., the coldest part of the heating/winter season.<br /><br />&bull; NCAT owns data rights to a server with essential information to the LIHEAP Performance Management Website and the LIHEAP Clearinghouse website. NCAT also owns data rights to a server with essential information for the complementary Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) Performance Management website. Further NCAT is presently working in conjunction with OCS on the timely renewal of web site operation certificates involving all three web sites. <br /><br />&bull; Only the existing contractor owns the data rights to essential information, has the knowledge base, network of contacts, technical ability, and experience with the energy assistance referral hotline and the web site. Likewise, the public and grantees have only known NCAT as the point-of-contact for these services. Therefore NCAT is the only responsible source and no services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vendors interested in this acquisition must demonstrate in writing they can meet the Government's requirement. Responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to satisfy the stated requirements. The written statements of capability (no more than 5 pages in length) should be emailed to the Contract Specialist, Peter Preston, at Peter.Preston@psc.hhs.gov and are due no later than 12:00 p.m. (ET) on December 6th, 2018. Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a sole source award to NCAT. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No solicitation document is available. The purpose of this announcement is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of the Government's intent to solicit, negotiate and award to only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The source is:
<p>DREDGE CONSTRUCTORS, LLC<br />998 GOLD RIDGE RD <br />SEBASTOPOL, CA 95472</p>
<p>NAICS 333999</p>
<p>The requirement is for:</p>
<p>14 EA -  Vosta, Straight Universal Coupling, SUC 32 inch quick-connect<br />2 EA - Vosta, Outer Suction Liner, 900mm<br />2 EA - Vosta, Throat Liner, 900mm</p>
<p>Business Size: Small.</p>
<p>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' (USACE) dredges discharge material through discharge pipelines. In order to facilitate safe and quick assembly and disassembly of the pipelines, Vosta LMG developed quick-connect couplings to serve as a break joint that can be quickly and safely un-coupled while partially submerged in water. The Vosta system is currently installed on the dredges included in this requirement. The couplings are required to be suitable for submersion in water and also suitable for use in steel pipeline dredging applications. Vosta's proprietary design incorporates a system that can be quickly operated by crew while the pipe line is partially submerged, without the need for heavy and cumbersome air tools. The Vosta LMG design minimizes exposure of crews to hazardous river conditions during the assembly and disassembly of both floating and steel pontoon pipeline systems.</p>
<p>Similarly, Vosta LMG pumps are aboard USACE dredges which contain various wear parts within the system. The outer suction liners and throat liners are required to be replaced once their useful life has been expended. OEM parts are required to ensure safe, reliable, and efficient operation of the dredge pump systems. Non-OEM parts are unable to meet the needs of the Government.</p>
<p>As of 2016, Vosta LMG does not participate in the U.S. market, and Dredge Constructors LLC is the sole rights holder of the design and technical data required to manufacture and sell the OEM parts listed above.</p>
<p>A request for quotes will not be issued.</p>
<p>If any responsible source believes it has the capability to fulfill the requirements above, it may submit information which shall be considered. Responses must be received by 10/30/2018 at 2:00 PM EST. Telephonic submissions will not be accepted. The point of contact is Dillon Lucas and can be reached via email at Dillon.m.lucas@usace.army.mil.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source. US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Portland District intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price service contract to Electronic Marine Systems, Inc; 800 Ferndale Place; Rahway, NH 07065 in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) - Only one source.
<p>The USACE Hopper Dredge YAQUINA uses a propulsion plant monitoring system for<br />displaying operating data and managing the plant's operation. This system uses proprietary engineered monitoring and sensing equipment manufactured by Electronic Marine Systems, Inc. As part of this system the bridge monitor CPU and display are designed and manufactured specifically for the ship's operational condition to be monitored by the ship driver on watch. It is imperative that this system functions correctly to allow monitoring of propulsion plant conditions to maintain safe operation of the vessel and achieve the dredging mission.</p>
<p>The bridge monitor CPU and display are necessary for the safe operation of the ship and accomplishment of the dredging mission. Loss of this capacity degrades the ability of the ship's crew to adequately monitor the ship's propulsion plant and in turn reduces the responsiveness of the crew when accomplishing the requirements of the ship's dredging mission.</p>
<p>A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE POSTED. The Government intends to proceed with this sole source action. The NAICS code is 334419 - Other Electronic Component Manufacturing. The size standard for this NAICS code defined by the U.S. Small Business Administration is 750 employees.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS OR<br />QUOTATIONS. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement to the contracting officer before the notice end date. If no affirmative written responses are received by 2:00 PM local time on 26 November 2018, an award will be made without further notice. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Electronic responses and questions shall be submitted via email to Teresa.f.dailey@usace.army.mil. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is not responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice.</p>

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), <br />Fort Detrick, Maryland in support of the US Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR),  intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.106-1) with Carl ZEISS Microscopy, LLC, 1 ZEISS Dr, Thornwood NY 10594-1939. Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-95 are incorporated.
<p>USAISR has a requirement for the isolation and analysis of a variety of sample types without contamination.  The ZEISS PALM Microbeam uses a patented process to capture specimens from cryosections, FFPE (formalin fixed and paraffin embedded) materials, native tissue like fresh plants, live cells and chromosomes allowing an investigator to define cells and tissue regions precisely, ensuring exact and reproducible results, without contamination. With the increasing use of histological samples at the USAISR,  we require a system that allows for the simultaneous processing of tissues for multiple applications.  ZEISS PALM allows for laser capture microdissection (LCM) and analysis for DNA, RNA and protein isolation, whether from archive material or live cells.  The unique system combines LCM with an integrated imaging workstation that can also be used for cryosections, including FFPE tissue.  With ZEISS-patented sample capture technology, LCM can be performed even from standard glass slides, e.g. archived material.<br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 334516 with a size standard of 1,000.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS and no solicitation exists for this requirement. However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received by closing of this notification of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />Based on the information above, the only technically acceptable LCM systems are provided by Carl ZEISS Microscopy.<br />Please submit email capability statements to  hugo.m.robinson.civ@mail.mil.  Statements are due not later than Thursday Dec 6th, 2018 at 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors:</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">(i) Price. <br />(ii) Technical Approach<br />A. Staffing<br />a. Qualifications of Personnel Proposed<br />b.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">Offers must first be determined acceptable in both technical capability and past performance in order to be considered eligible for award. For technical capability to be considered acceptable, the offer must clearly demonstrate how the Offeror will meet the minimum performance requirements of the Performance Work Statement (PWS). For past performance to be considered acceptable, the Government must have a reasonable expectation, based on the offeror's performance record, of recent and relevant information, that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. To be considered recent, information must not be older than six (6) years of the date set for receipt of quotes. In the event an offeror does not have a record of relevant past performance, the offeror will not be rated favorably or unfavorably.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</span></p>

The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information which is not identified in the offer.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">(2) Evaluation of Option to Extend Services under 52.217-8. For the purposes of the award of this Contract, the Government intends to evaluate the option to extend services, provided under FAR 52.217-8, as follows: The evaluation will consider the possibility that the option can be exercised at any time during any contract performance period, and can be exercised in increments of one to six months, but for no more than a total of six months during the life of the contract. The evaluation will assume that the prices for any option exercised under FAR 52.217-8 will be at the same rates as those in effect under the contract when the option is exercised. The evaluation will therefore assume that the addition of the price or prices of any possible extension or extensions under FAR 52.217-8 to the total price for the basic requirement and the total price for the priced options has the same effect on the total price of all proposals relative to each other, and will not affect the ranking of proposals based on price, unless, after reviewing the proposals, the Government determines that there is a basis for finding otherwise. This evaluation will not obligate the Government to exercise any option under FAR 52.217-8.</span></p>

3.  Statement of Work:

1.0 STATEMENT OF WORK/BACKGROUND:  

Veterans sometimes require continuous IV medication therapy while undergoing an MR exam.  MR uses a superconducting magnet that can cause ferromagnetic objects to become projectiles as they are drawn into the bore of the magnet posing a safety hazard to the veteran in the bore of the magnet.  The strong magnetic field also causes electronic devices to malfunction.  We need MR Safe Infusion Pumps for patient care.

1.1 SCOPE OF SERVICE:

The purpose of this item is to allow the continuous delivery of fluids throughout the MRI care cycle, and decrease the patient s time off their originating care unit.



1.1.a OBJECTIVE:

The Equipment is required to safely administer medications and fluids during MRI procedures. The non-magnetic design allows the MRidium® infusion pump to operate
safely in ultra-high magnetic fields without the need for workarounds used with traditional infusion pumps.

1.2 REQUIREMENTS/TASKS:

Unit shall have FDA clearance 
Shall have Customizable Drug Library
Audible and visual system alarm
Operates in a minimum magnetic field of 10,000 Gauss

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Nasopharyngeal Airways Adjustable. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Nasopharyngeal Airways Adjustable products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Nasopharyngeal Airways Adjustable in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Nasopharyngeal Airways Adjustable will be established approximately March 2019 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately April 2019, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Nasopharyngeal Airways Adjustable. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Nasopharyngeal Airways Adjustable.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Nasopharyngeal Airways Adjustable. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $196,863. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Three items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 100 % ($196,863) of the total volume in sales ($196,863). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.</strong><br />1.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Nasopharyngeal Airways Non-Adjustable. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Nasopharyngeal Airways Non-Adjustable products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Nasopharyngeal Airways Non-Adjustable in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Nasopharyngeal Airways Non-Adjustable will be established approximately March 2019 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately April 2019, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Nasopharyngeal Airways Non-Adjustable. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Nasopharyngeal Airways Non-Adjustable.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Nasopharyngeal Airways Non-Adjustable. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $456,124. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Six items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 100% ($456,124) of the total volume in sales ($456,124). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><br />C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Standardization Information Meeting (JSIM) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Incentive_Spirometers_Adult. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MS-1805-63_ Incentive_Spirometers_Adult are eligible for participation. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Incentive_Spirometers_Adult products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. Vendors must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs, CARDINAL HEALTH and OWENS &amp; MINOR, to distribute through the PV Program. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MS-1805-63_Incentive_Spirometers_Adult. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of 36 months from date of selection, with one 24-month option period not to exceed a total of five (5) years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is 07 Jan 2019. Among vendors who are on QSL MS-1805-63_Incentive_Spirometers_Adult, the lowest price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Incentive_Spirometers_Adult.<br /><strong><br />Vendors agree to hold the submitted IA pricing firm for 75 days from the date specified for receipt of their IA offer. Notification of non-selection will be sent once the IA process is completed and the bilateral IA is signed.<br /></strong><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Incentive_Spirometers_Adult. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $285,472 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD).<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL MS-1805-63_Incentive_Spirometers_Adult who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding; and (5) electronic printout(s) of base uncommitted offering submitted log or offered items already on DAPA. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that the submission, quote, and DAPA documentation were received by the MMESO South via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. Vendors must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Using the IA FBO Package Worksheet, pricing quotes must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.<br /></strong><br />1. Vendors will be required to submit incentive pricing discounts off DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, the incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.<br /><br />2. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><strong><br />Required Products / Annual Usage in Units</strong> /<br />INCENTIVE SPIROMETERS, ADULT 2.5 LITER / 29,652 /<br />INCENTIVE SPIROMETERS, ADULT 4 LITER TO 5 LITER / 67,780 /<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor instructions for Submission of DAPA Log and Commercial Pricing information</span><br />3. Vendor must submit a DAPA Log via the DAPA Management System (DMS) Manufacturer's Application including all offered items and relevant base uncommitted pricing for each. Submitted log base uncommitted pricing must correlate directly to that on the IA FBO Package Worksheet for all offered items. Vendors must send a screenshot of their submitted DAPA Log or of the required items already on their existing DAPA. Screenshots must be received by the MMESO POC's by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Vendors who do not meet this deadline will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an IA.<br /><br />4. Vendor must send supporting commercial pricing information to the DAPA administrator by the above response date of this Sources Sought notification. Commercial pricing will help DAPA administrators make a fair and reasonable determination. To assist DAPA administrators in identifying Standardization submissions via e-mail, vendors should cite the product line name and IA number as shown in this IA FBO announcement.<br /><br />Note: DAPA holders must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs to distribute through the PV Program. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to both PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." It is strongly recommended that participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items. These costs should be factored into any base uncommitted DAPA prices and any quoted IA prices.<br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing evaluation of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price evaluation is based on the sum of each required item's offered IA unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. If all other requirements have been met, the lowest overall price will be selected for the IA for Standardization. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes, but reserves the right to seek further discounts or request revised quotes if determined necessary. <br /><strong>&bull; In order to be eligible for selection, vendors are required to have established Fair and Reasonable base uncommitted DAPA prices for each product in the product line by time of selection.<br />&bull; Failure to establish a DAPA with approved base uncommitted pricing will preclude a vendor from being selected to establish an IA with the government.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Points of Contact (POCs):</span> <br />MMESO South Clinical Analyst, Mr. Joe Winter, 210-536-6072, joseph.n.winter.ctr@mail.mil and MMESO South Team Leader, Mr. David Sheaffer, 210-536-6075, david.v.sheaffer.ctr@mail.mil.

Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately May 2019, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Post-Op Shoes. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Post-Op Shoes.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Post-Op Shoes. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $265,710. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Fifteen items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 87.1 % ($231,336) of the total volume in sales ($265,710). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Surgical N95 Mask Particulate Respirator - Molded Cup Design. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Surgical N95 Mask Particulate Respirator - Molded Cup Design products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Surgical N95 Mask Particulate Respirator - Molded Cup Design in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Surgical N95 Mask Particulate Respirator - Molded Cup Design will be established approximately March 2019 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only."

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">SUMMARY</span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the Fermi Research Alliance, LLC (FRA) is leading the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) Project to enable a world-class program in neutrino physics.&nbsp; Specifically, the LBNF Project (http://lbnf.fnal.gov/) provides the infrastructure for a new high-intensity neutrino beam at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) aimed at large liquid argon-based neutrino detectors to be located nearly a mile underground at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, SD.&nbsp; In close coordination with LBNF, the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will construct and install the liquid argon neutrino detectors planned for SURF.&nbsp; In support of DUNE, the LBNF Project will construct a Nitrogen System on the surface and deep underground at the 4850-foot level (4850L) at SURF to provide refrigeration for the liquid argon neutrino detectors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">DUNE (http://www.dunescience.org/) is a leading-edge, international experiment for neutrino science and proton decay studies.&nbsp; Discoveries over the past half-century have put neutrinos, the most abundant matter particles in the universe, in the spotlight for further research into several fundamental questions about the nature of matter and the evolution of the universe. DUNE is expected to achieve transformative discoveries by making definitive determinations of neutrino properties, examining the dynamics of supernovae that produced the heavy elements necessary for life, and probing the possibility of proton decay.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The experiment is supported by LBNF, which will provide the infrastructure necessary to support the massive neutrino detectors located deep underground at SURF in Lead, SD. SURF is the site of the 8,000-foot deep former Homestake Gold mine which was converted into a physics and materials laboratory in the early 2000s.&nbsp; DUNE will employ four (4) neutrino detectors, housed in cryostats requiring nearly 70,000 tons of liquid argon (about 17,400 tons for each cryostat).&nbsp; In order to commission the detectors, liquid argon will be supplied at the surface, vaporized for transport to the experiment a mile underground, and condensed to liquid argon for the filling of the cryostats.&nbsp; During operation of the cryostats, argon boiloff gas from the cryostats will be recondensed back to liquid argon.&nbsp; Enclosure 1 shows the planned Process Flow Diagram (PFD) with only one cryostat for simplicity.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">NITROGEN SYSTEM</span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Nitrogen System is a closed loop cryogenic refrigeration system (Enclosure 3) and is composed of the following elements:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Liquid Nitrogen Refrigeration System</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;- Nitrogen Compression - Four gaseous nitrogen compressors (above ground).</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;- Nitrogen Refrigeration - Four refrigeration units comprised of cold boxes and expanders, each with a capacity of 100 kW (below ground - 4850L).</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Liquid Nitrogen Storage - Provides&nbsp;52,834 gallons (200 cubic meters) of buffer and backup liquid nitrogen storage in pressurized dewars (below ground - 4850L).</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Argon Condensers - Evaporation of liquid nitrogen provides the cooling power to liquefy argon gas via heat exchangers (below ground - 4850L).</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Interconnecting Piping - Includes high-pressure and low-pressure gaseous nitrogen piping linking the above ground compressors with the below ground nitrogen refrigeration units, the insulated liquid nitrogen distribution headers, and gaseous nitrogen return headers (Enclosure 2). <br />&nbsp;<br />The nitrogen refrigeration system will provide a total refrigeration capacity of 400 kW, supplied by four (4) units, each with a capacity of 100 kW with turndown capability to&nbsp;65 kW. The refrigerator system mass flow balance shall be maintained by this turndown capacity, as well as auxiliary operation of electrical heaters.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">At this time, the interconnecting piping and Argon Condensers will be provided by FRA and are not a part of this RFP.</span></p>

52.209-5 Representation by Corporations Regarding an Unpaid Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction Under Any Federal Law(Deviation) (March 2012) 
(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that 
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals 
(A) Are   are not   presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
(B) Have   have not  , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks  have , the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); 
(C) Are   are not   presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;
(D) Have  , have not  , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(2) Examples. 
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. During the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 
(2)  Principal,  for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). 
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible.
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

The solicitation number is 95332419Q0015. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) and is attached in full to this announcement.</p>
<p>MCC seeks a Contractor to collect data from households and businesses in Burkina Faso to assess: 1. The potential economic benefit of the incremental value of using higher energy value and lower cost per unit of electric service instead of alternative energy sources such as generators, candles, kerosene lamps, charcoal, wood, and batteries for lighting and household appliances; 2. Households' and firms' willingness to pay (WTP) for more reliable electricity supply; (Note 2: Willingness to pay: The maximum amount that an individual indicates that he or she is willing to pay for a good or service. Economic benefit: The increased benefit that a recipient could receive from a proposed project compared to his or her present situation. In the case of an electrification project, it indicates the attributed benefit of the electric service in<br />monetary units, versus the use of current energy alternatives.); 3. Socio-economic details regarding beneficiaries (gender, socio-professional category, poor / non-poor, and those outlined in the Senegal survey; see Section J attachment for a sample questionnaire); and 4. Geo-spatial coordinates of respondent households and community level electricity poles. A critical outcome of this effort is to develop and test a rigorous and concise methodology for designing a survey that captures intra-household dynamics and gender differentiated benefits and use of electrification.</p>

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(ii) The solicitation number is 75N95019Q00021 and the solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) on a Full and Open competitive basis. This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5- Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT) of $250,000.00.  A Fixed-Price type of Purchase Order contract is contemplated for any resulting contract entered into as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC Number/Effective Date: FAC_2005-101	/ 10-26-2018</p>
<p>(iv) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 325998 - All Other Miscellaneous Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing with associated small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>(v) Background<br />The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a translational science center whose mission is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions. The Division of Pre-Clinical Innovation (DPI) at NCATS plans, conducts and uses both internal and contract resources to advance collaborative research projects across the pre-clinical phases of the translational science spectrum.</p>
<p>The DPI is developing 3-D tissue models that more closely mimic the complexity of tissues in the human body in a reproducible, automated and scalable manner using bioprinting techniques to better predict how potential new drugs will affect humans. Specifically, DPI is focused on developing a 3D tissue of blood retina barrier (BRB) to mimic pathological conditions in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using bioprinting technology and patient specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In this model, biodegradable scaffold plays a role as a substrate of both retina pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and bioprinting of choroid tissue including choriocapillaris. This scaffold is considered as a temporary Bruch's membrane, which is the basement membrane located between RPE and choroid. Bruch's membrane allows molecular interaction between RPE and choroid, and its thickness is about 2~4 &micro;m. In wet form of AMD, vessel growth from choroid, choroidal neovascularization (CNV), compromises Bruch's membrane and RPE. Engineered tissue requires capability to show CNV and cell-to-cell interaction. To achieve these aims, the scaffold thickness is required to be as thin as Bruch's membrane, and the half-time of biodegradation needs to be approximately one month to allow cell communications during tissue development. In wet AMD model, these features of scaffold thickness facilitates access of molecules secreted by RPE to printed choroid, and biodegradation helps CNV development to reach RPE layer.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objective: <br />The purpose of this requirement is to obtain biodegradable poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PDLGA) scaffold. Electrospun PDLGA scaffold is required for building multi-tissue layers including vascularized tissue and epithelium to mimic blood retina barrier (BRB), which requires pore size control, biodegradation period, retaining mechanical strength and bioprinting capability with bioink including multi cell types and epithelial cell monolayer formation. Biodegradation of scaffolds will be required for cell-cell communications and cell migration in disease models. An additional manufacturing step is required to get the final products of precut scaffolds with 10~12mm diameter, which will facilitate and accelerate the bioprinting process.</p>
<p>Product Description: The Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to obtain the subject requirement that achieves the following specifications.</p>
<p>a. 10~12mm diameter pre-cut (laser cut) scaffolds from 9cm (W) x 10cm (L) of scaffold sheets containing ~500nm of electrospun nanofibers. <br />b. Thickness is less than 10 &micro;m. <br />c. Pore size is less than 1.0 &micro;m diameter to prevent from cell migration and to separate culture media from top to bottom without leakage for 3 weeks using pre- and post- thermal process. <br />d. Capable of maintaining mechanical strength at least for 3 weeks. <br />e. Half degradation time is about a month.</p>
<p>Specifically, the following salient characteristics are deemed essential that this potential requirement will achieve:</p>
<p>a. Small pore size to enhance tissue engineering capability including multi cell types;<br />b. Biodegradation of scaffolds to help integration of 3D tissue layers, which is a key feature to mimic cell-cell communications within tissues in various pathological conditions;<br />c. Is biocompatible, biodegradable, and bioprintable with bioink;<br />d. Capable of cell monolayer formation on the surface;<br />e. Each item should be properly sterilized and labeled, pursuant to the product description requirements set forth herein.</p>

(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, Compliance with the Laws (APR 2010)<br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. (End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:</p>
<p>(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and</p>
<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.

<p>NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>Contractor Access to NOAA Facilities (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.</p>
<p>(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:</p>
<p>(i)	Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;</p>
<p>(ii)	Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;</p>
<p>(iii)	Occupational safety or health hazards;</p>
<p>(iv)	Lapse in Appropriations; or</p>
<p>(v)	Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.</p>
<p>(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(b)	In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply.  If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed. In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.</p>
<p>(c)	The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels.  Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(d)	For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-</p>
<p>(1)	Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;</p>
<p>(2)	Forego the work; or</p>
<p>(3)	Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>(e)	Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1)	The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility.  The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access.  Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel.  Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p>(2)	Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue.  If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery.  Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery.  Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities.  CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.</p>
<p>Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer.  The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted 72 hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. <br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services Contract (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)	The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel.  It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b)	Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1)	Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.</p>
<p>(2)	Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government.  Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d)	Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e)	Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance.  In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>
<p>(1)	The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language.  The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>
<p>(2)	The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor.  The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>1330-52.222-70 NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy (MAY 2018)<br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA.</p>
<p>(a)	Definitions.</p>
<p>Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members.</p>
<p>Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim.</p>
<p>Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true:</p>
<p>&bull;	Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment;<br />&bull;	Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual;<br />&bull;	The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.<br />(b)	Requirements.</p>
<p>1.	It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment.</p>
<p>2.	The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor.</p>
<p>3.	If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6,.07, Reporting from Remote Locations.</p>
<p>i.	Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed.<br />ii.	The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable).</p>
<p>4.	The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within          business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable.</p>

For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals:<br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced.

However, the contractor shall not be responsible for any such loss or damage discovered after redelivery of the vessel unless the loss or damage is discovered within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel and loss or damage is affirmatively shown to be the result of the fault or negligence of the contractor. To induce the contractor to perform the work for the compensation provided, it is specifically agreed that the contractor's aggregate liability on account of loss of or damage to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and Government-owned materials and equipment, shall in no event exceed the sum of $1,000,000.00. As to the contractor, the Government assumes the risk of loss or damage to the Government-owned vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and said Government-owned materials and equipment in excess of $1,000,000.00. This assumption of risk includes but is not limited to loss or damage from negligence of whatsoever degree of the contractor's servants, employees, agents or subcontractors, but specifically excludes loss or damage from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of contractor's personnel, who have supervision or direction of all or substantially all of the contractor's business, or all or substantially all of the contractor's operation at any one plant.

Such indemnity shall include, without limitation, suits, actions, claims, costs or demands of any kind whatsoever, resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring during the period of performance of work on the vessel or within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel. Any new equipment warranties that extend beyond the 90 days after redelivery of the vessel shall be assigned to the Government upon redelivery of the vessel. With respect to any such suits, actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring after the expiration of such period, the rights and liabilities of the Government and the contractor shall be as determined by other provisions of this contract and by law; provided that such indemnity shall apply to death occurring after such period which results from any personal injury received during the period covered by the contractor's indemnity as provided herein.<br />(d) The contractor shall, at its own expense, procure, and thereafter maintain such casualty, accident and liability insurance, in such forms and amounts as may be approved by the Contracting Officer, insuring the performance of its obligations under paragraph (c) of this clause. In addition, the contractor shall at its own expense procure and thereafter maintain such ship repairer's legal liability insurance as may be necessary to insure the contractor against its liability as ship repairer in the amount of $1,000,000.00, or the value of the vessel as determined by the Contracting Officer, whichever is the lesser, with respect to each vessel on which work is performed.

However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(f) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable reduction shall constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract.

<p>DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (DOC)<br />NATIONAL OCEANIC ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA)<br />NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE (NWS)<br />WEATHER FORECAST OFFICE (WFO) ALBUQUERQUE, NM</p>
<p>HYDROGEN GAS SUPPLY, DELIVERY AND CYLINDER RENTAL</p>
<p><br />DELIVERY PERIOD:</p>
<p>Base Year: 1/1/2019 through 12/31/2019<br />Option Year 1: 1/1/2020 through 12/31/2020 <br />Option Year 2: 1/1/2021 through 12/31/2021 <br />Option Year 3: 1/1/2022 through 12/31/2022 <br />Option Year 4: 1/1/2023 through 12/31/2023</p>
<p><br />1. BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The NWS is a 24-hour, 365-day operation and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property. The NWS in Albuquerque, NM, launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 0400 and 1600 MST. Each balloon requires approximately 75 cubic feet (CF) of hydrogen. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon that provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide, incorporated into weather models, and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days into the future.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of the NWS is to receive and keep on-site an adequate supply of hydrogen gas (no less than 600 CF, and up to 4,500 CF) in individual cylinders to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying hydrogen to the NWS upper air building located at 2341 Clark Carr Loop SE, Albuquerque, NM, 87106-5633. The total amount of hydrogen to be delivered for the 12-month period of this requirement will be a minimum of 54,000 CF, and up to a maximum of 70,000 CF. The hydrogen will be supplied at regular intervals throughout the period, provided as individual cylinders, delivered approximately every two weeks. See Delivery Schedule in Section below for details.</p>
<p>4. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>All deliveries are to be made to the NWS office at 2341 Clark Carr Loop SE, Albuquerque, NM, 87106-5633. The point of delivery is at the Upper Air Inflation Building, located through the gate and past the main office. The hydrogen truck is permitted to use the main driveway for delivery. The drop off door is located on the north side of the inflation building as depicted by the red arrow in the aerial picture below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Site Storage and Usage: All hydrogen must be provided in individual cylinders as the facility is not arranged to allow for other configurations. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store up to 30 cylinders of hydrogen at a time. This site uses a minimum of 150 CF of hydrogen, every day of the year. Actual use has the potential to vary should NWS Albuquerque have a need to launch extra balloons. The NWS anticipates using 6,000 CF every five weeks. The NWS's intent is to be replenished with the maximum volume of hydrogen of approximately 9,000 CF after each completed delivery.</p>
<p>Initial Delivery: The contractor shall supply a minimum of 6,000 CF of hydrogen on November 1, 2018. The actual amount of supplied hydrogen will vary based on the size of the cylinders. The hydrogen will be contained in no more than thirty (30) 300 CF capacity individual cylinders.</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: Deliveries shall be made every five weeks, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 0800 and 1700 local time. This is a strict time slot as balloon launches must not be delayed or interrupted in order to receive the delivery. Balloon launches occur twice a day, every day of the year, regardless of holidays. Therefore, the delivery schedule needs to be maintained regardless of holidays. If a holiday falls on a scheduled delivery day and the Contractor is not able to complete a regularly scheduled delivery, the Contractor shall make arrangements in advance for an alternate delivery date. The Contractor will contact the NWS office if a delivery is going to be delayed for any other reason. If the Contractor is unable to find a reasonable supply in time to fill the requirement, the NWS reserves the right to purchase hydrogen from another supplier outside of this contract.</p>
<p>If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the Contractor and request the additional delivery, with delivery to be completed within three calendar days of being contacted.</p>
<p>The delivery schedule shall be arranged with the Upper Air Program Point-of Contact, Meteorologist-In-Charge (MIC), or Administrative Support Assistant (ASA) upon contract award (see Section below for contact information).</p>
<p>Transition Period: If this contract is awarded to a provider other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the contract, the new Contractor and one of the NWS points of contact listed in Section below shall establish the delivery schedule, including coordinating the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of cylinders by the former contractor. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to a provider other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts in order to minimize the risk of a missed balloon launch due to the hydrogen being unavailable at the launch site. The end-of-contract transition period may include a<br />lighter delivery in the final weeks of the contract.</p>
<p>Recurring Deliveries: The point of delivery is not staffed except during balloon launches. The Contractor shall supply hydrogen gas to the Place of Performance in accordance with the coordinated date and time scheduled.</p>
<p>The Contractor will replenish to 30 total bottles of hydrogen on a five week basis in accordance with the arranged schedule, replacing all empty hydrogen cylinders with full hydrogen cylinders. The Contractor shall pick up the empty cylinders in the same trip. If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the Contractor and request the additional delivery, with delivery to be completed within three business days of being contacted.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall contact NWS personnel at this location when arriving for a delivery. The loading area is located on the north side of the inflation building. The loading area will remain clear of obstructions and all safety rules shall be followed. Cylinders can be rolled from a truck lift gate to its delivery point. All equipment necessary for loading and unloading the hydrogen shall be provided by the Contractor.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure the bottles are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and clean fashion with the cap loose and nozzle facing out. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises. NWS personnel will not assist with loading or unloading of cylinders.</p>
<p>Evidence of Delivery: The driver shall provide evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by a NWS representative at the time of delivery. A copy of the signed receipt shall be left with the NWS representative, and a copy shall also be attached to the associated invoice when mailed.</p>
<p>Compliance: If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements (i.e. a delivery results in less than full replenishment of hydrogen to 9,000 CF), the Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount (i.e. without additional delivery charges).</p>
<p>6. SAFETY AND SECURITY</p>
<p>All rules concerning safety, including but not limited to not smoking and the security of the property, must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the MIC or ASA at each office, where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>
<p>7. INVOICING</p>
<p>The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's hydrogen deliveries and related surcharges (i.e. cylinder rental fee, etc.). The invoice must include the following items:</p>
<p>A. Name and address of the contractor (must be the same on the Purchase Order)<br />B. Invoice date and invoice number<br />C. Purchase Order number and associated line item number from the Purchase Order<br />D. Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of supplies delivered, and date of delivery<br />E. Evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by NWS representative at the time of delivery<br />F. Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice (a defective invoice is one that does not meet all the above requirements)</p>
<p>The invoices should be sent to the following address:</p>
<p>National Weather Service <br />2341 Clark Carr Loop SE<br />Albuquerque, NM, 87106-5633</p>
<p>(VII) All deliveries are to be made to the National Weather Service (NWS), 2341 Clark Carr Loop SE, <br />Albuquerque, NM, 87106-5633</p>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.237-72 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.<br />In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance. <br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted "to be determined as needed" hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.</p>

Note: Page numbers in this document may not be accurate.</p>
<p>All contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.SAM.gov) prior to award of a contract. All proposed contractors are highly encouraged to review FAR Clause 52.232-33 Payments by Electronic Funds Transfer - System for Award Management, which indicates "All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT)." Those not currently registered can obtain registration by going to the website http://www.SAM.gov. The process can usually be completed from 24 to 48 hours after submission. Contractors will need to obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (formerly DUNS number) for processing their registration. If you do not already have a Unique Entity Identifier, one can be obtained from http://www.SAM.gov. Refer to www.SAM.gov for information formerly found in CCR, EPLS, ORCA and FedReg.</p>
<p>Please begin the registration process immediately in order to avoid delay of the contract award should your firm be selected.</p>
<p>ALERT: You must submit a notarized letter appointing the authorized Entity Administrator before your registration will be activated. This requirement now applies to both new and existing entities. Effective 29 April 2018, the notarized letter process is now mandatory on all CURRENT registrants at SAM who have a requirement to update data on their SAM record. The notarized letter is mandatory and is required<br />before the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) will activate the entity's registration.</p>
<p>Effective 29 June 2018, vendors creating or updating their registration can have their registration activated prior to the approval of the required notarized letter. However, the signed copy of the notarized letter must be sent to the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) within 30 days of activation or the vendor risks no longer being active in SAM.</p>
<p>Vendors can check whether an account is active by performing a query by their CAGE or Unique Entity Identifier (known as DUNS). The new registration process may now take several weeks, so vendors are highly encouraged to begin registering as soon as possible to avoid any possible delays in future contract awards. Remember, there is no cost to use SAM. To find out additional information about the changes of the SAM registration process, contractors should visit the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) link located at the top of the SAM homepage (www.sam.gov).</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: SAM is completely free of charge for both registrants and users.</p>

Salient Characteristics: Performance 1 each Sigma Knee Revision and Instrumentation or equivalent with vendor rep available in the operating room during patient specific surgery scheduled for 4 December 2018. The SIGMA&reg; High Performance Partial Knee is a unique system comprised of unicondylar and patellofemoral implants and a full range of state-of-the-art instruments to perform both of these procedures. The system's implants are designed to treat degenerative joint disease one compartment at a time: medial uni, lateral uni and patellofemoral. This allows the surgeon to replace only the affected compartment, leaving healthy bone, cartilage and ligaments intact. The modularity of the system addresses one of the main reasons for early intervention revision, disease progression. Because of the ability to maintain the ACL with this system, normal kinematics in activities of daily living can be achieved. The uni components are designed for patients who require a higher than normal degree of flexion, providing support up to 155 degrees. The combination of a highly polished cobalt chrome tray with a moderately cross linked polyethylene insert is designed to help reduce backside wear.

If a breach involves PII without PHI, then the Business Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act Issuance breach response requirements only; if a breach involves PHI (a subset of PII), then the Business Associate shall comply with both Privacy Act and HIPAA breach response requirements. A breach involving PHI may or may not constitute an HHS Breach. If a breach is not an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate has no HIPAA breach response obligations. In such cases, the Business Associate must still comply with breach response requirements under the DoD Privacy Act Issuances.<br />If the DHA Privacy Office determines that a breach is an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate shall comply with both the HIPAA Breach Rule and DoD Privacy Act Issuances, as directed by the DHA Privacy Office, regardless of whether the breach occurs at DHA or at one of the Service components.

In general, for breach response, the Business Associate shall report the breach to the Covered Entity, assess the breach incident, notify affected individuals, and take mitigation actions as applicable. Because DoD defines "breach" to include possible (suspected) as well as actual (confirmed) breaches, the Business Associate shall implement these breach response requirements immediately upon the Business Associate's discovery of a possible breach.<br />(b)Government ReportingProvisions<br />The Business Associate shall report the breach within one hour of discovery to the Covered Entity and to the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US CERT) -the other parties as deemed appropriate by the Covered Entity. The Business Associate is deemed to have discovered a breach as of the time a breach (suspected or confirmed) is known, or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to any person (other than the person committing it) who is an employee, officer or other agent of the Business Associate.<br />The Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report using the online form at https://forms.us- cert.gov/report/. Before submission to US-CERT, the Business Associate shall save a copy of the on-line report. After submission, the Business Associate shall record the US-CERT Reporting Number. Although only limited information about the breach may be available as of the one hour deadline for submission, the Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report by the deadline. The Business Associate shall e-mail updated information as it is obtained, following the instructions at http://www.us-cert.gov/pgp/email.html.<br />The Business Associate shall provide a copy of the initial or updated US-CERT report to the-Covered Entity and the applicable Service-Level Privacy Office, if requested by either.Business Associate questions about US-CERT reporting shall be directed to the CoveredEntity or Service-Level Privacy Office, not the US- CERT office.<br />The additional US Army and the US Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) reporting requirements are addressed in the PII Breach Reporting and Notification Policy. The latest version of this policy can be obtained from the Covered Entity or the MEDCOM Privacy Act/Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Office at: usarmy.jbsa.medcom.list.medcom-foia-users@mail.mil . If multiple beneficiaries are affected by a single event or related set of events, then a single reportable breach may be deemed to have occurred, depending on the circumstances. The Business Associate shall inform the Covered Entity as soon as possible if it believes that "single event" breach response is appropriate; the Covered Entity will determine how the Business Associate shall proceed and, if appropriate, consolidate separately reported breaches for purposes of Business Associate report updates, beneficiary notification, and mitigation.<br />When a Breach Report initially submitted is incomplete or incorrect due to unavailable information, or when significant developments require an update, the Business Associate shall submit a revised form or forms, stating the updated status and previous report date(s) and showing any revisions or additions in red text.<br />Examples of updated information the Business Associate shall report include, but are not limited to: confirmation on the exact data elements involved, the root cause of the incident, and any mitigation actions to include, sanctions, training, incident containment, follow-up, etc. The Business Associate shall submit these report updates promptly after the new information becomes available. Prompt reporting of updates is required to allow the Covered Entity to make timely final determinations on any subsequent notifications or reports. The Business Associate shall provide updates to the same parties as required for the initial Breach Report. The Business Associate is responsible for reporting all information needed by the Covered Entity to make timely and accurate determinations on reports to HHS as required by the HHS Breach Rule and reports to the Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties<br />12<br />Office as required by DoD Privacy Act Issuances.<br />In the event the Business Associate is uncertain on how to apply the above requirements, the Business Associate shall consult with the Covered Entity (or the Service-Level Privacy Office, which will consult with the DHA Privacy Office as appropriate) when determinations on applying the above requirements are needed.<br />(c)Individual Notification Provisions<br />If the DHA Privacy Office determines that individual notification is required, the Business Associate shall provide written notification to individuals affected by the breach as soon as possible, but no later than 10 working days after the breach is discovered and the identities of the individuals are ascertained. The 10 day period begins when the Business Associate is able to determine the identities (including addresses) of the individuals whose records were impacted.<br />The Business Associate's proposed notification to be issued to the affected individuals shall be submitted to the parties to which reports are submitted under paragraph V (a) for their review, and for approval by the DHA Privacy Office. Upon request, the Business Associate shall provide the DHA Privacy Office with the final text of the notification letter sent to the affected individuals. If different groups of affected individuals receive different notification letters, then the Business Associate shall provide the text of the letter for each group. (PII shall not be included with the text of the letter(s) provided.) Copies of further correspondence with affected individuals need not be provided unless requested by the Privacy Office. The Business Associate's notification to the individuals, at a minimum, shall include the following:<br />-The individual(s) must be advised of what specific data was involved. It is insufficient to simply state that PII has been lost. Where names, Social Security Numbers (SSNs) or truncated SSNs, and Dates of Birth (DOBs) are involved, it is critical to advise the individual that these data elements potentially have been breached.<br />-The individual(s) must be informed of the facts and circumstances surrounding the breach. The description should be sufficiently detailed so that the individual clearly understands how the breach occurred.<br />-The individual(s) must be informed of what protective actions the Business Associate is taking or the individual can take to mitigate against potential future harm.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(a)<em> Definition. </em>"Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(e)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) terminate the contract for default.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.</span></p>

<p>The Grantee ("CODATA") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop the Paraiba State ICT Modernization Technical Assistance.</p>
<p>As of July 2016, Brazil was estimated to have 139 million Internet users, ranking it the fourth largest market in the world, according to an annual survey conducted by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee. However, the number of fixed broadband subscribers (i.e., broadband access in homes and businesses, in contrast to cellular and mobile access) in the country has reached only 26 million out of a population of approximately 205 million (equivalent to only 12.7 percent of the population). While mobile connections are relatively common among the population, the benefits of platforms pertaining to e-learning, e-health and e-Government cannot be fully realized using smartphones alone. There are still vast unconnected rural areas, particularly in the north, northeast and west of the country.  For example, in the northeast region, fixed broadband penetration is only<br />1.5	percent for rural areas.</p>
<p>Para&iacute;ba is located in the northeast region of Brazil and has a population of 4 million people. As the state's most important economic sector is services, comprising 73 percent of the state's GDP in 2013 (mostly within commerce, tourism, and government services), reliable ICT services are vital for the state's economy.</p>
<p>CODATA is the state IT company responsible for providing ICT services to all entities within the State Government of Para&iacute;ba.  CODATA is seeking technical assistance to:<br />&bull;	Estimate state government demand for data center services over the next five years;<br />&bull;	Assess the current capacity of CODATA's data center, the other principal state data centers and smaller server rooms (particularly for the Secretariat of Revenue (Secret&aacute;ria de Receita) regarding equipment, software and physical facilities.<br />&bull;	Design a plan for the integration and consolidation of the state's data centers, including full active-active backup of all the data centers, to ensure they operate securely under a cloud computing architecture, significantly reduce costs and improve quality of service as compared to the present system and satisfy the projected demand for data center services and<br /> <br />&bull;	Determine the requirements for new hardware and software for the integrated and consolidated system of data centers, including the possible use of a private or public cloud computing architecture;<br />&bull;	Propose a design and business model for the expanded broadband network; and<br />&bull;	Support implementation of the upgraded data center and backup data center.<br />The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$733,830 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors:</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">(i) Price. <br />(ii) Technical Approach<br />A. Staffing<br />a. Qualifications of Personnel Proposed<br />b.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">Offers must first be determined acceptable in both technical capability and past performance in order to be considered eligible for award. For technical capability to be considered acceptable, the offer must clearly demonstrate how the Offeror will meet the minimum performance requirements of the Performance Work Statement (PWS). For past performance to be considered acceptable, the Government must have a reasonable expectation, based on the offeror's performance record, of recent and relevant information, that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. To be considered recent, information must not be older than six (6) years of the date set for receipt of quotes. In the event an offeror does not have a record of relevant past performance, the offeror will not be rated favorably or unfavorably.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</span></p>

The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information which is not identified in the offer.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">(2) Evaluation of Option to Extend Services under 52.217-8. For the purposes of the award of this Contract, the Government intends to evaluate the option to extend services, provided under FAR 52.217-8, as follows: The evaluation will consider the possibility that the option can be exercised at any time during any contract performance period, and can be exercised in increments of one to six months, but for no more than a total of six months during the life of the contract. The evaluation will assume that the prices for any option exercised under FAR 52.217-8 will be at the same rates as those in effect under the contract when the option is exercised. The evaluation will therefore assume that the addition of the price or prices of any possible extension or extensions under FAR 52.217-8 to the total price for the basic requirement and the total price for the priced options has the same effect on the total price of all proposals relative to each other, and will not affect the ranking of proposals based on price, unless, after reviewing the proposals, the Government determines that there is a basis for finding otherwise. This evaluation will not obligate the Government to exercise any option under FAR 52.217-8.</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors:</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">(i) Price. <br />(ii) Technical Approach<br />A. Staffing<br />a. Qualifications of Personnel Proposed<br />b.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">Offers must first be determined acceptable in both technical capability and past performance in order to be considered eligible for award. For technical capability to be considered acceptable, the offer must clearly demonstrate how the Offeror will meet the minimum performance requirements of the Performance Work Statement (PWS). For past performance to be considered acceptable, the Government must have a reasonable expectation, based on the offeror's performance record, of recent and relevant information, that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. To be considered recent, information must not be older than six (6) years of the date set for receipt of quotes. In the event an offeror does not have a record of relevant past performance, the offeror will not be rated favorably or unfavorably.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</span></p>

The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information which is not identified in the offer.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">(2) Evaluation of Option to Extend Services under 52.217-8. For the purposes of the award of this Contract, the Government intends to evaluate the option to extend services, provided under FAR 52.217-8, as follows: The evaluation will consider the possibility that the option can be exercised at any time during any contract performance period, and can be exercised in increments of one to six months, but for no more than a total of six months during the life of the contract. The evaluation will assume that the prices for any option exercised under FAR 52.217-8 will be at the same rates as those in effect under the contract when the option is exercised. The evaluation will therefore assume that the addition of the price or prices of any possible extension or extensions under FAR 52.217-8 to the total price for the basic requirement and the total price for the priced options has the same effect on the total price of all proposals relative to each other, and will not affect the ranking of proposals based on price, unless, after reviewing the proposals, the Government determines that there is a basis for finding otherwise. This evaluation will not obligate the Government to exercise any option under FAR 52.217-8.</span></p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (DOC)<br />NATIONAL OCEANIC ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA)<br />NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE (NWS)<br />WEATHER FORECAST OFFICE (WFO) ALBUQUERQUE, NM</p>
<p>HYDROGEN GAS SUPPLY, DELIVERY AND CYLINDER RENTAL</p>
<p><br />DELIVERY PERIOD:</p>
<p>Base Year: 1/1/2019 through 12/31/2019<br />Option Year 1: 1/1/2020 through 12/31/2020 <br />Option Year 2: 1/1/2021 through 12/31/2021 <br />Option Year 3: 1/1/2022 through 12/31/2022 <br />Option Year 4: 1/1/2023 through 12/31/2023</p>
<p><br />1. BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The NWS is a 24-hour, 365-day operation and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property. The NWS in Albuquerque, NM, launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 0400 and 1600 MST. Each balloon requires approximately 75 cubic feet (CF) of hydrogen. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon that provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide, incorporated into weather models, and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days into the future.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of the NWS is to receive and keep on-site an adequate supply of hydrogen gas (no less than 600 CF, and up to 4,500 CF) in individual cylinders to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying hydrogen to the NWS upper air building located at 2341 Clark Carr Loop SE, Albuquerque, NM, 87106-5633. The total amount of hydrogen to be delivered for the 12-month period of this requirement will be a minimum of 54,000 CF, and up to a maximum of 70,000 CF. The hydrogen will be supplied at regular intervals throughout the period, provided as individual cylinders, delivered approximately every two weeks. See Delivery Schedule in Section below for details.</p>
<p>4. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>All deliveries are to be made to the NWS office at 2341 Clark Carr Loop SE, Albuquerque, NM, 87106-5633. The point of delivery is at the Upper Air Inflation Building, located through the gate and past the main office. The hydrogen truck is permitted to use the main driveway for delivery. The drop off door is located on the north side of the inflation building as depicted by the red arrow in the aerial picture below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Site Storage and Usage: All hydrogen must be provided in individual cylinders as the facility is not arranged to allow for other configurations. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store up to 30 cylinders of hydrogen at a time. This site uses a minimum of 150 CF of hydrogen, every day of the year. Actual use has the potential to vary should NWS Albuquerque have a need to launch extra balloons. The NWS anticipates using 6,000 CF every five weeks. The NWS's intent is to be replenished with the maximum volume of hydrogen of approximately 9,000 CF after each completed delivery.</p>
<p>Initial Delivery: The contractor shall supply a minimum of 6,000 CF of hydrogen on November 1, 2018. The actual amount of supplied hydrogen will vary based on the size of the cylinders. The hydrogen will be contained in no more than thirty (30) 300 CF capacity individual cylinders.</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: Deliveries shall be made every five weeks, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 0800 and 1700 local time. This is a strict time slot as balloon launches must not be delayed or interrupted in order to receive the delivery. Balloon launches occur twice a day, every day of the year, regardless of holidays. Therefore, the delivery schedule needs to be maintained regardless of holidays. If a holiday falls on a scheduled delivery day and the Contractor is not able to complete a regularly scheduled delivery, the Contractor shall make arrangements in advance for an alternate delivery date. The Contractor will contact the NWS office if a delivery is going to be delayed for any other reason. If the Contractor is unable to find a reasonable supply in time to fill the requirement, the NWS reserves the right to purchase hydrogen from another supplier outside of this contract.</p>
<p>If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the Contractor and request the additional delivery, with delivery to be completed within three calendar days of being contacted.</p>
<p>The delivery schedule shall be arranged with the Upper Air Program Point-of Contact, Meteorologist-In-Charge (MIC), or Administrative Support Assistant (ASA) upon contract award (see Section below for contact information).</p>
<p>Transition Period: If this contract is awarded to a provider other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the contract, the new Contractor and one of the NWS points of contact listed in Section below shall establish the delivery schedule, including coordinating the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of cylinders by the former contractor. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to a provider other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts in order to minimize the risk of a missed balloon launch due to the hydrogen being unavailable at the launch site. The end-of-contract transition period may include a<br />lighter delivery in the final weeks of the contract.</p>
<p>Recurring Deliveries: The point of delivery is not staffed except during balloon launches. The Contractor shall supply hydrogen gas to the Place of Performance in accordance with the coordinated date and time scheduled.</p>
<p>The Contractor will replenish to 30 total bottles of hydrogen on a five week basis in accordance with the arranged schedule, replacing all empty hydrogen cylinders with full hydrogen cylinders. The Contractor shall pick up the empty cylinders in the same trip. If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the Contractor and request the additional delivery, with delivery to be completed within three business days of being contacted.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall contact NWS personnel at this location when arriving for a delivery. The loading area is located on the north side of the inflation building. The loading area will remain clear of obstructions and all safety rules shall be followed. Cylinders can be rolled from a truck lift gate to its delivery point. All equipment necessary for loading and unloading the hydrogen shall be provided by the Contractor.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure the bottles are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and clean fashion with the cap loose and nozzle facing out. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises. NWS personnel will not assist with loading or unloading of cylinders.</p>
<p>Evidence of Delivery: The driver shall provide evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by a NWS representative at the time of delivery. A copy of the signed receipt shall be left with the NWS representative, and a copy shall also be attached to the associated invoice when mailed.</p>
<p>Compliance: If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements (i.e. a delivery results in less than full replenishment of hydrogen to 9,000 CF), the Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount (i.e. without additional delivery charges).</p>
<p>6. SAFETY AND SECURITY</p>
<p>All rules concerning safety, including but not limited to not smoking and the security of the property, must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the MIC or ASA at each office, where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>
<p>7. INVOICING</p>
<p>The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's hydrogen deliveries and related surcharges (i.e. cylinder rental fee, etc.). The invoice must include the following items:</p>
<p>A. Name and address of the contractor (must be the same on the Purchase Order)<br />B. Invoice date and invoice number<br />C. Purchase Order number and associated line item number from the Purchase Order<br />D. Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of supplies delivered, and date of delivery<br />E. Evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by NWS representative at the time of delivery<br />F. Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice (a defective invoice is one that does not meet all the above requirements)</p>
<p>The invoices should be sent to the following address:</p>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.237-72 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.<br />In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance. <br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted "to be determined as needed" hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (DOC)<br />NATIONAL OCEANIC ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA)<br />NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE (NWS)<br />SANTA TERESA WEATHER FORECAST OFFICE (WFO)</p>
<p>HYDROGEN GAS SUPPLY, DELIVERY AND CYLINDER RENTAL</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />1. BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24 hour, 365 day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is protection of life and property. The NWS in Santa Teresa, NM launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 0400 and 1600 Mountain Standard Time or 0500 and 1700 Mountain Daylight Time. Each balloon requires approximately 75 cubic feet (CF) of hydrogen. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of the NWS is to receive and keep on-site an adequate supply of hydrogen gas (no less than 600 CF, up to 4,500 CF) in individual cylinders to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying hydrogen to the NWS upper air building located at 7955 Airport Rd, Santa Teresa, NM 88008. The total amount of hydrogen to be delivered for the 12 month period of this requirement will be a minimum of 54,000 CF, up to a maximum of 70,000 CF. The hydrogen will be supplied at regular intervals throughout the period, provided as individual cylinders, delivered approximately every two weeks. See Delivery Schedule below for details.</p>
<p>4. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>All deliveries are to be made to the NWS office at 7955 Airport Rd, Santa Teresa, NM 88008. The point of delivery is at the Upper Air Inflation Building, located east of the main office building, past the locked gate, at the end driveway. The hydrogen truck is permitted to use the driveway for delivery. The hydrogen storage area room is accessed through a double door located on the south side of the Inflation Building (arrow on picture of the property and facilities below). NWS personnel will be responsible for opening, closing, and securing gates and doors at the NWS facilities and property. Someone is always at the main office, so contact them to open the gate and the Upper Air Inflation Bldg. hydrogen storage area double door. There is a slight rise into the hydrogen storage area room from the outside, with a door sill that the cylinders must be rolled over. Otherwise, the point of delivery area is flat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />5. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Site Storage and Usage: All hydrogen must be provided in individual cylinders as the facility is not arranged to <br />allow for other configurations. The Government has space in the hydrogen storage area room to receive and store up <br />to 22 cylinders of hydrogen at a time. The maximum limit of stored hydrogen cylinders will be 15 and will be<br />stored west of the doors in the hydrogen storage area room. This site uses a minimum of 150 CF of hydrogen every <br />day of the year. Actual use can vary, particularly if the Government has to launch extra balloons. The Government<br />anticipates using 2,100 CF every 2 weeks, but need to keep an additional store of hydrogen on site in case of additional unforeseen launches. The intent is that the Government will be replenished to approximately 4,000 CF after each completed delivery.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure bottles are individually and securely chained upright at delivery and placed in an <br />orderly/neat and clean fashion with cap loose and nozzle facing out. Chain lengths are 56 inches, enough to chain 2 <br />bottles individually. NWS personnel will not assist with loading or unloading of cylinders. NWS personnel will <br />make an attempt to mark empty cylinders by placing a small box on the cap of each empty cylinder. The Contractor <br />will remove the boxes and place them away from the main traffic area and the cylinders, on the East side of the <br />room. The Contractor will unchain each empty cylinder prior to removal. After cylinders are replaced and secured, <br />any extra chains will also be placed away from the main traffic area and the cylinders, on the East side of the room. <br />Our Upper Air Inflation Building hydrogen storage area room is in the picture below.</p>
<p><br /><br />Initial Delivery: The Contractor shall supply approximately 4,000 CF of hydrogen on January 1, 2019. The actual amount supplied will vary based on the size of the cylinders. The hydrogen will be contained in no more than fifteen, 300 CF individual cylinders.</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: Deliveries shall be made every other week, Monday through Friday between the hours of 0800 and 1500 local time. This is a strict time slot as the balloon launches must not be delayed or interrupted in order to receive the delivery. Balloon launches occur twice a day, every day of the year, regardless of holidays. Therefore, the delivery schedule needs to be maintained regardless of holidays. If a holiday falls on a scheduled delivery day and the Contractor is not able to complete a regularly scheduled delivery, the Contractor shall make arrangements in advance for an alternate delivery date. The Contractor will contact the NWS office if a delivery is going to be delayed for any other reason. If the Contractor is unable to find a reasonable supply in time to fill the requirement, the NWS reserves the right to purchase hydrogen from another supplier outside of this contract.</p>
<p><br />The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises.</p>
<p>If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the Contractor and request the additional delivery, with delivery to be completed within three calendar days of being contacted.</p>
<p>The delivery schedule shall be arranged with the Upper Air Program Point-of Contact, Meteorologist-In-Charge<br />(MIC) upon contract award (see section below for contact information).</p>
<p>Transition Period: If this contract is awarded to other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the contract, the new Contractor and one of the agency points of contact, listed in section 8 below, shall establish the delivery schedule, including coordinating the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of cylinders by the former Contractor. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts in order to minimize the risk of a missed balloon launch due to the hydrogen being unavailable at the launch site. The end-of-contract transition period may include a lighter delivery in the final weeks of the contract.</p>
<p>Recurring Deliveries: The point of delivery is not staffed except for during the balloon launches. The Contractor shall supply hydrogen gas to the Place of Performance in accordance with the coordinated date and time schedule</p>
<p>The Contractor will replenish back to approximately 4,000 CF of hydrogen on a every other week basis in accordance with the arranged schedule, replacing all empty hydrogen cylinders with full hydrogen cylinders. The Contractor shall pick up all empty cylinders in the same trip. If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the Contractor and request the additional delivery, with delivery to be completed within three business days of being contacted.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall contact NWS personnel at this location when arriving for a delivery. The loading area is located on the South side of the Inflation Building. The loading area will remain clear of obstructions and all safety rules shall be followed. Cylinders can be rolled from a truck lift gate to its delivery point. All equipment necessary for loading and unloading the hydrogen shall be provided by the Contractor.</p>
<p>Evidence of Delivery: The Driver shall provide evidence of delivery by way of receipt at the time of delivery. A NWS representative will review then sign the receipt after verifying delivery details. All discrepancies will be corrected before a NWS representative signs the receipt. A copy of the signed receipt shall be left with the NWS representative, and a copy shall also be attached to the associated invoice when mailed or e-mailed.</p>
<p>Compliance: If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements (i.e. a delivery results in less than full replenishment of hydrogen up to approximately 4,000 CF), the Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount (i.e. without additional delivery charges).</p>
<p><br />6. SAFETY AND SECURITY</p>
<p>All rules concerning safety, not smoking and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the MIC at each Office, where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>
<p><br />7. INVOICING</p>
<p>The Contractor will invoice within 5 to 7 days of each delivery, and within 5 to 7 days for any pre-negotiated monthly related surcharges or fees in arrears for that month (i.e. cylinder rental fee, etc.). The invoice must include the following items:</p>
<p>a. Name and address of the Contractor, which must be the same as that on the Purchase Order.<br />b. Invoice date and invoice number.<br />c. Purchase Order number and associated line item number from the Purchase Order.<br />d. Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of supplies delivered.<br />e.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.237-72 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.<br />In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance. <br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted "to be determined as needed" hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.</p>

<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (DOC)<br />NATIONAL OCEANIC ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA)<br />NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE (NWS)<br />SHREVEPORT WFO (WEATHER FORECAST OFFICE)</p>
<p>HYDROGEN AND HELIUM GAS SUPPLY, DELIVERY AND CYLINDER RENTAL</p>
<p><br />DELIVERY PERIOD:</p>
<p>Base Year: 1/1/2019 through 12/31/2019<br />Option Year 1: 1/1/2020 through 12/31/2020 <br />Option Year 2: 1/1/2021 through 12/31/2021 <br />Option Year 3: 1/1/2022 through 12/31/2022 <br />Option Year 4: 1/1/2023 through 12/31/2023 <br /><br />1. BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24 hour, 365 day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property. The NWS in Shreveport, LA launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 1100 and 2300 UTC. Each balloon requires approximately 75 cubic feet (CF) of hydrogen. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of the NWS is to receive and keep on-site an adequate supply of hydrogen and helium gas (Hydrogen no less than 2,300 CF, up to 4,800 CF) (Helium no less than 394 CF) in individual cylinders to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying hydrogen and Helium to the NWS upper air building located at 5655 Hollywood Ave, Shreveport LA 71109. The total amount of hydrogen to be delivered for the 12 month period of this requirement will be a minimum of 54,000 CF, up to a maximum of 70,000 CF.</p>
<p>The total amount of Helium will be a minimum of 397 CF, up to a maximum of 985 CF. The hydrogen and Helium will be supplied at regular intervals throughout the period, provided as individual cylinders, hydrogen delivered approximately every two weeks. Helium will be delivered on request. See Delivery Schedule in Section below for details.</p>
<p>4. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>All deliveries are to be made to the NWS office at 5655 Hollywood Ave, Shreveport LA 71109. The point of delivery is at the Upper Air Inflation building, located on the North side of the main building at the top of the driveway past the main office. The hydrogen truck is permitted to use the main driveway for delivery; drop off door is located on the West side of the inflation building (red arrow on below picture of the facilities).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />5. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Site Storage and Usage: All hydrogen must be provided in individual cylinders as the facility is not arranged to <br />allow for other configurations. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store up to 22 <br />cylinders of hydrogen at a time. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store 2 cylinders <br />of Helium at a time. This site uses a minimum of 150 CF of hydrogen, every day of the year. Actual use has the <br />potential to vary if the Government has to launch extra balloons. The Government anticipates using 2,100 CF <br />every 2 weeks, but need to keep an additional store of hydrogen on site in case of additional unforeseen <br />launches. The intent is that the Government will be replenished to our maximum of approximately 4,334 CF <br />after each completed delivery. The site uses helium as a back-up in case the hydrogen system fails. The <br />Government anticipates using helium only in an emergency.</p>
<p>Initial Delivery: The contractor shall supply a minimum of 4,334 CF of hydrogen and 394 CF of helium on <br />May 1, 2018. The actual amount of supplied will vary based on the size of the cylinders. The hydrogen will be <br />contained in no more than 22, 197 CF capacity individual cylinders. The helium will be contained in no more <br />than 2, 197 CF capacity individual cylinders.</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: Deliveries shall be made every other week, Monday through Friday between the hours of <br />0800 and 1500 local time. This is a strict time slot as the balloon launches must not be delayed or interrupted in <br />order to receive the delivery. Balloon launches occur twice a day, every day of the year, regardless of holidays. <br />Therefore, the delivery schedule needs to be maintained regardless of holidays. If a holiday falls on a scheduled <br />delivery day and the Contractor is not able to complete a regularly scheduled delivery, the Contractor shall <br />make arrangements in advance for an alternate delivery date. The Contractor will contact the NWS office if a <br />delivery is going to be delayed for any other reason. If the Contractor is unable to find a reasonable supply in <br />time to fill the requirement, the NWS reserves the right to purchase hydrogen or helium from another supplier <br />outside of this contract.</p>
<p>If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the <br />Contractor and request the additional delivery, with delivery to be completed within three calendar days of <br />being contacted. The NWS will contact the Contractor to request delivery of helium as needed.</p>
<p>The delivery schedule shall be arranged with the Upper Air Program Point-of Contact, Meteorologist-In-Charge <br />(MIC), or Administrative Support Assistant (ASA) upon contract award (see section below for contact <br />information).</p>
<p>Transition Period: If this contract is awarded to other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day <br />of the contract, the new Contractor and one of the agency points of contact, listed in section below, shall <br />establish the delivery schedule, including coordinating the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of <br />cylinders by the former contractor. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is <br />awarded to other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition <br />coordination efforts in order to minimize the risk of a missed balloon launch due to the hydrogen being <br />unavailable at the launch site. The end-of-contract transition period may include a lighter delivery in the final <br />weeks of the contract.</p>
<p>Recurring Deliveries: The point of delivery is not staffed except for during the balloon launches. The Contractor shall supply hydrogen gas to the Place of Performance in accordance with the coordinated date and time schedule</p>
<p>The Contractor will replenish back to 4,334 CF of hydrogen on a every other week basis in accordance with the arranged schedule, replacing all empty hydrogen cylinders with full hydrogen cylinders. The Contractor shall pick up the empty cylinders of hydrogen and/or helium in the same trip. If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the Contractor and request the additional delivery, with delivery to be completed within three business days of being contacted. If additional helium is required, The NWS will contact the Contractor and request helium, with delivery to be completed with the next scheduled hydrogen delivery.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall contact NWS personnel at this location when arriving for a delivery. The loading area is located on the West side of the inflation building. The loading area will remain clear of obstructions and all safety rules shall be followed. Cylinders can be rolled from a truck lift gate to its delivery point. All equipment necessary for loading and unloading the hydrogen shall be provided by the Contractor.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure the bottles are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and clean fashion with cap loose and nozzle facing out. The Contractor shall ensure the Full tags are placed on the new cylinders. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises. NWS personnel will not assist with loading or unloading of cylinders.</p>
<p>Evidence of Delivery: The Driver shall provide evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by an NWS representative at the time of delivery. A copy of the signed receipt shall be left with the NWS representative, and a copy shall also be attached to the associated invoice when mailed.</p>
<p>Compliance: If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements (i.e. a delivery results in less than full replenishment of hydrogen to 4,334 CF), the Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount (i.e. without additional delivery charges).</p>
<p>6. SAFETY AND SECURITY</p>
<p>All rules concerning safety, not smoking and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the MIC or ASA at each office, where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>
<p>7. POINTS OF CONTACT</p>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52.237-72 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.<br />In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance. <br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted "to be determined as needed" hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Modification #2:</span></strong>
<p>The following points of clarification have been provided by the Grantee and/or USTDA in response to questions received:</p>
<p>Question: Will the selected contractor or its subcontractors be eligible to participate in any future follow-on work related to the USTDA-funded activity?</p>
<p>&bull;	There is no bar in Egypt to a company that carries out a competed feasibility study from competing on the follow-on work.  Historically, a contractor or its subcontractor's participation in a USTDA-funded feasibility study has not precluded its ability to carry out any follow-on work that might occur as a result of the activity.  However, any follow-on work would ultimately be decided by the Grantee and is up to their discretion.</p>
<p>Question: Will there be a "data room" or similar facility for obtaining information from any relevant past studies on the project, including engineering, management, financial, social, environmental or archaeological issues?  Can you speak to the quality and quantity of available past data?</p>
<p>&bull;	There will not be a data room or similar facility for obtaining information from any relevant past studies on the project, including engineering, management, financial, social, environmental or archaeological issues.  Any questions regarding relevant past studies should be directed to the USTDA MENA/EE regional team.</p>
<p>Question: Will the selected contractor have direct access to the individuals and firms, including Constant Group LLC, who conducted past studies in order to ask follow-up questions?</p>
<p>&bull;	The selected contractor will not have direct access to the individuals and firms, including the Constant Group LLC, who conducted past studies.  Follow-up questions should be directed to the USTDA MENA/EE regional team.</p>
<p>Question: The RFP and FBO.gov solicitation state that the project is 2,300 MW and 2.3 MW respectively. Which number is correct?</p>
<p>&bull;	The study will examine the feasibility of developing a 2,300 MW combined cycle gas turbine plant with two identical 1,150 MW blocks.</p>
<p>Question: Subtask 3(a) requests that the selected contractor evaluate secondary fuel requirements for liquid fuel for this project including sourcing, transport, and storage. What is the secondary fuel being considered for this project?</p>
<p>&bull;	The secondary fuel being considered for this project is light diesel oil, the specifications of which is provided by the supplier of natural gas / liquid fuel (Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company/Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation) in Exhibit 2 of the draft fuel supply agreement (FSA).</p>
<p>Question: To what extent should the selected contractor consider this secondary liquid fuel in the remaining portions of this RFP (air permitting emissions, performance, specifications, etc.)?</p>
<p>&bull;	The maximum number of operating hours using liquid fuel per year is set in the draft fuel supply agreement (FSA) at 168 continuous hours (or 7 days per year).  Accordingly, it needs to be factored in relevant subtasks of the RFP.</p>
<p>Question: Subtask 3(b) requests that the selected contractor conduct a transmission line/interconnection assessment using the analysis and project information collected and analyzed.  The assessment requested includes the feasibility assessment, system impact assessment, and facilities study.  What information for these studies is provided by the sponsor for the electrical interconnection process?</p>
<p>&bull;	The Egyptian Electricity Holding Company (EETC), the off-taker who is also the transmission system operator (TSO), already issued its approval for plant interconnection to the existing 220 KV electric grid at the plant site in Tawerat in the Qena Governorate.  In case it does not exist in the vicinity of the plant site, a substation would have to be procured and installed at the site as part of the EPC scope to boost the voltage of generation units.  Further information could be sought from EETC during the course of conducting the study.</p>
<p>Question: Have these studies already been started by the transmission owner?</p>
<p>&bull;	It is assumed that EETC has conducted an initial study based upon its approval for plant interconnection.</p>
<p>Question: What is the scope for GE for this project?  Are they proposing to provide only the power island equipment or a full turnkey package with EPC services included?</p>
<p>&bull;	GE is the preferred OEM (i.e.; preferred supplier of power island), and GE will be referenced as such in the turnkey EPC tender document of the project.</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposal Submission Place</span></strong>:
<div><br /></div>
<div>Mr. Robson Luiz Schiefler e Silva, Assistant Manager to the Board of Directors <br />Generation and Transmission Directorate <br />E-mail for proposal submissions: robsonl@copel.com <br />Address: Rua Coronel Dulc&iacute;dio, 800 - Batel Curitiba, Paran&aacute;, Brasil, 80420-170 <br />Telephone: 55-41-3310-5050</div>
<p>The Grantee ("COPEL") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop the Copel Cybersecurity Project Technical Assistance.</p>
<p>Brazilian generation, transmission, and distribution companies are adopting automated solutions for their operations and maintenance in order to remain competitive. The increasing adoption of digital and remotely controlled systems has improved efficiencies in the electricity sector in Brazil, but it has also elevated concerns about the sector's resiliency and ability to withstand cybersecurity threats. With the exception of the State of Roraima, Brazil has an interconnected, inter-state transmission grid. Brazil currently has an installed generation capacity of 137 GW and over one thousand transmission substations, resulting in a considerable number of sites in need of cybersecurity protection.</p>
<p>Companhia Paranaense de Energia ("Copel") is the electricity and generation company for the State of Paran&aacute; and has become a national standard for operations automation. Copel has implemented solutions for remote access to substation supervision, as well as other mission critical solutions for its operations. Copel has 38 transmission substations and 21 generation stations and is critical for the energy security of the State of Parana.</p>
<p>Copel seeks Technical Assistance for three main reasons. First, Copel would like to help identify vulnerabilities related to its operational systems, including gaps in its security protocols, processes, regulations, and technologies. It would also help develop an implementation plan for the installation and upgrade of cybersecurity solutions, protocols and procedures, using the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection Plan (CIP) as a reference. The adoption of NERC CIP-based standards would better position U.S. vendors for future procurements.</p>
<p>Second, this technical assistance would develop the specifications and requirements for a follow&shy;on pilot to be implemented directly by Copel, immediately following the conclusion of the technical assistance. The technical assistance would not include the pilot but would provide Copel with the necessary technical analyses to move forward with the pilot. Third, Copel is committed to using the recommendations of the technical assistance to promote and advocate for new cybersecurity regulations in the country. As one of the first major utility-scale cybersecurity projects in the country, this activity is anticipated to be a catalyst for future projects and serve as a model for future standards and regulations.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$601,455 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1100, Arlington, VA 22209. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form</span></strong></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-997-2392. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Portuguese directly to the Grantee by <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2:00 PM local time in Curitiba, Paran&aacute;, on December 7, 2018</strong></span> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.</p>
<p>The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<div><br /></div>
<div>Industry Day presentation slides, attendance roster and formal Questions and Answers are attached.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Please note the formal response to the Sources Sought Notice is due at 1200 MST on 26 November 2018.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>** Original Notice **</div>
<div><br /></div>
The USDA Forest Service (USFS) is interested in establishing an alternative source for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Specification for Long Term Retardant, Forest Fire, Aircraft or Ground Application, 5100-304c (NAICS code 115310 or 325180).  The current sole source vendor is Perimeter Solutions. The product must be provided in locations, volumes and time constraints dictated by the contract which can fluctuate based on the severity of the fire season.  The annual estimated volume of retardant utilized in the United States is 26M gallons.  The annual value of the retardant and services to deliver, mix and load retardant exceeds $100M.
<p>In order to support the establishment of alternate sources, the USFS is holding an industry day on 15 November 2018 from 0800 to 1200 local time at the Best Western Vista Inn, 2645 W Airport Way, Boise, ID in the Bitterroot Room. The USFS will provide background information on the long-term fire retardant program; technical information regarding the specification, testing, and qualification process; and potential opportunities for Government contracts, to include exclusion of sources to establish or maintain alternative sources in accordance with FAR 6.202.  There may also be specific opportunities for small businesses.</p>
<p>At the industry day the USFS would like to hear from interested parties regarding their interest, perceived limitations of market entrance, performance and price risks, desired guarantees, and other topics which would promote an increase in manufacturers and suppliers.  The results of this market research will contribute to an approach that the USFS uses to support alternate sources, especially small business concerns.</p>
<p>The USFS has testing and approval procedures established for the evaluation of products that suppliers propose for use by the USFS and its cooperators during wildland fire management operations. All products submitted under the established Qualification Requirement (QR) must meet U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Specification for Long Term Retardant, Forest Fire, Aircraft or Ground Application, 5100-304c with amendments. The current specification can be found at www.fs.fed.us/rm/fire/wfcs/documents/304c.pdf. Products that do not meet all requirements of specification 5100-304c will not be considered. Qualification testing and evaluation costs for small business will be borne by the USDA as provided by FAR 9.204(a)(2).<br />If your organization has the potential interest or capacity to meet the qualification requirements and provide products and related services as required, please attend the industry day and/or provide the following information: 1) organization name, contact name, address, email address, website address, telephone number, and size and type of ownership for the organization; and 2) tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability.</p>
<p>There is no solicitation at this time. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial liability for any costs incurred.</p>
<p>Based on the responses to this sources sought notice/market research, this requirement may be set-aside for small businesses or procured through full and open competition, and multiple awards may be made. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions.</p>
<p>Submission instructions: Interested parties who consider themselves qualified to provide the products and related services listed above are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice by 26 November 2018 at 1200 Mountain Time. All responses under this Sources Sought Notice must be emailed to the retardant contracting officer, Larry Robillard at larryrobillard@fs.fed.us.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;The purpose of this amendment is to&nbsp;make minor corrections to&nbsp;the topic descriptions.&nbsp;
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background</strong></p>
<p>The Other Transaction Authority (OTA), 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2371b, allows the Department of Defense (DoD) to "carry out prototype projects that are directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms, systems, components or materials proposed to be carried out by the DoD, or to improvement of platforms, systems, components, or materials in use by the armed forces." Constant innovation and rapid technology advances are occurring throughout the world. Partnerships with commercial industry, the civil maritime sector, and others will be used to leverage these approaches and increase flexibility and agility, reduce cost, improve technology and capability insertion, and decrease program development cycles. The OTA offers an alternative to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)&#8208;based acquisitions, allowing for access to participation by non-traditional defense contractors with innovative solutions that may not normally desire to participate in government procurement.</p>

One-on-One Sessions: These sessions will only be held in person from approximately 2:30PM to 4:30PM.  The intent of these One-on-One sessions is to provide Industry a private, non-public forum to present the Government with comments, concerns and recommendations.  Thus, the One-on-One sessions are designed to consist of mostly one-way communication (from the firm to the Government) as the Government does not intend to share contract strategy information outside of the larger and/or public forum.
 These sessions will be no longer than 30 minutes in length, may be attended by no more than 4 people per company, and will be scheduled on a first come first serve basis.  The Government will inform attendees of their scheduled session time no later than 18 December 2018.
To assist the industry in understanding the Government requirements, the following information is provided;
1.  A draft contract including sections B through J.
2. Notional sample work packages for typical availabilities being ordered off the resultant IDIQ contract.
3.  Sample of existing contract delivery order.

Any questions regarding the content of the industry day shall be in writing only and shall be submitted in accordance with attachment 2 format.  Written questions shall be emailed to Kevin Giardini at kevin.giardini@eu.navy.mil by 4:00PM Local time on 12 December 2018.  The Government may elect to not respond to any questions after 4:00PM local time on 12 December 2018.        
 
General Stipulations and Disclaimers:  Recording of the event is not permitted.  Other than the planned briefing materials referenced above, the Government does not plan to provide additional information for review and comment prior to the Industry Day.
 This announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind on the part of the Government.  FISCSI Det Rota Spain does not assume liability for costs incurred by an attendee or for travel expenses or marketing efforts; therefore, attendee costs in response to this notice are not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.

<DESC>The VA has been providing direct and specialized services for homeless Veterans for over 25 years.  As part of the VA Plan to End Homelessness among Veterans announced in late 2009, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has increased capacity of existing programs and services offered to program participants.  VA efforts to meet the needs of the most vulnerable homeless Veterans have led to innovative program models and new evidence based approaches within its homeless programs.
Recent national trends in service provision for the homeless outside of the VA system include the utilization of Safe Havens as an alternative to shelter care or as a placement after unsuccessful discharge from an inpatient or residential treatment program due to relapse-related issues.  A Safe Haven is a form of treatment housing that serves hard-to-reach homeless persons with severe mental illnesses and/or substance use disorders that are on the streets and have been unable or unwilling to participate in more traditional treatment services.  It is a  low demand  model of service delivery that allows clients to engage in treatment and services at their own pace.  Because VA is limited by current grant authorities and existing program structures and practices and cannot fund harm-reduction treatment models, VA has been unable to provide the types of services focused on shelter diversion and early stabilization in community-based environments and has been criticized by outside organizations for not having this component of the continuum of care. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA) efforts to end homelessness among Veterans has focused on enhancing current homeless service capacity as well as developing new programs and initiatives in concert with community and federal partners.  The intent of this contract is for the James J. Peters VA Medical Center, Bronx, New York (aka,  Bronx VA ), to engage a community provider to offer homeless Veterans services through a  Safe Haven  model of residential care.  Under the contract authority of VA s Healthcare for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) Contract Residential Care programs, the Bronx VA will solicit community organizations to provide  Safe Haven  services as a  specialty model.   This model of HCHV Contract Residential Care will offer services up to 40 street homeless Veterans under the HCHV Contract Residential Care program enhanced by the services as defined in the Tasks and Deliverables.  These services must be put forth in the solicitation.  Significant deviation from these services can dilute the model as prescribed, and thus disrupt ongoing program evaluation and fidelity studies.  The VA National Center on Homelessness among Veterans ( the Center ) provides ongoing support for program development for both providers and VA staff.  Additionally, the Center has formulated the evaluation protocol and program fidelity measures which must be adhered to by the selected Contractor and the Bronx VA.  The Bronx VA will contract for up to 40 beds and associated services through procedures in line with their own business practices and contracting services.  
Entities that are interested in providing Veterans these services should be aware that although this contract seeks services for the Bronx VA, HCHV is a national program serving Veterans throughout the country. This program has become one of the largest VA interventions to assist homeless Veterans. It is also the first specialized homeless program developed by the VA.  It represents one of VA s most significant efforts to achieve the President s goal of ending homelessness among Veterans.  The Safe Haven program model has been developed by VA in a number of other high priority cities and continues to be highly monitored.
This contract for Safe Haven residential care will serve up to 40 street homeless Veterans in need of immediate placement in a safe environment with onsite treatment services.  Many of these Veterans have co-morbid conditions that include serious mental illnesses, substance abuse disorders, and other serious medical conditions. The goal of the HCHV Contract Residential Care Program is to rapidly stabilize Veterans  medical, mental health, substance abuse and other psychosocial problems in order to place Veterans in other appropriate permanent housing as quickly as possible within 90 to 180 days, but no more than 270 days from the date of admission.  VA intends to engage a Contractor to provide rapid placement of VA-referred Veterans in a safe, residential treatment setting while addressing Veterans  complex needs through on-site treatment case management services using a Safe Haven model.   This housing must meet the criteria established both by HCHV clinical staff and VA fire and safety officials.  Contractors are urged in the strongest terms to carefully review the requirements outlined in the Performance Work Statement to ensure that all facilities fire and safety and treatment services criteria can be met in a timely way. 
This contract is intended for a community based contractor currently operating a Safe Haven residential care program with on-site treatment services and demonstrated experience serving street homeless Veterans in conjunction with the New York City Department of Homeless services contracted street outreach teams in the five boroughs of New York City and the Bronx VA Medical Center whereby this contract provides supplemental funding for Veterans to receive immediate placement and enhanced on-site clinical services designed to address Veterans  unique and population specific needs.  VA will consider proposals for new residential treatment programs if it can be determined that the contractor can meet all of the terms of the Performance Work Statement within the required time frames.  VA places a great deal of emphasis on the responsibility and accountability of contractors receiving VA funds through the HCHV Contract Residential Care program. VA has procedures in place to monitor facilities and treatment services provided to homeless Veterans as well as outcomes associated with the services provided in HCHV Contract Residential Care programs and the Safe Haven model programs.  
The target population for HCHV Contract Residential Care Safe Haven is street homeless, seriously mentally ill Veterans, Veterans with chronic substance abuse disorders and/or serious medical problems and complex needs.  To be eligible for the HCHV Contract Residential Care Safe Haven program, Veterans must:
Be eligible for VA health care as determined by the local VA medical center
Be determined to be chronically street homeless based on McKinney-Vento / HEARTH Act definitions by the local VA medical center HCHV program [see Reference section for additional information]
Be assessed by the HCHV program at the VA medical center to have serious mental health, substance abuse, medical and/or other serious psychosocial conditions or stressors that makes the Veteran highly vulnerable with a high likelihood of death due to homelessness, and has been unable or unwilling to participate in more traditional treatment services.
HCHV Contract Residential Care Safe Haven Veterans are referred to the contractor based on a demonstrated need for case management and treatment services to stabilize their mental health, substance abuse, medical and/or other co-occurring serious psychosocial issues in order to secure transitional or permanent housing as quickly as possible.  In the Bronx, the program will target Veterans who are engaged in care through a collaborative partnership among the Bronx VA, the New York City Department of Homeless Services contracted street outreach teams, and the selected Safe Haven provider.
This contract will only be awarded to one contractor with a facility in the Bronx that meets the requirements outlined in the Tasks and Deliverables.  A VA Liaison to the contractor will be identified by the homeless program leadership at the Bronx VA.  She/he will act as the clinical liaison for all client related issues between the Contractor and the Bronx VA homeless team.   She/he will provide clinical oversight.  She/he will not provide direct clinical supervision. 
Clinical oversight refers to a working relationship between VA liaisons and the Contractor in which the VA liaisons ensure compliance with the tasks and associated deliverables in this Performance Work Statement, as well as ensuring the safety and quality of care provided to Veterans.  In providing clinical oversight, VA liaisons may also serve as consultants to the Contractor in enhancing safe and effective person-centered care in complex situations to meet the needs of Veterans in conjunction with VA regulations, requirements, and guidelines.
Clinical supervision refers to regular structured meetings whose primary purpose is to assess the skills and performance of individual practitioners and foster practitioner progress in the expertise of planning work, diagnosis, and therapeutic intervention.  Clinical supervision is a structured process focused on staff professional growth and learning to develop knowledge, skills, competence, and capabilities in a therapeutic milieu.
While there is arguably overlap between clinical oversight and clinical supervision, VA expects the selected Contractor to have the staffing and expertise to execute the tasks and associated deliverables associated with this Performance Work Statement without reliance or undue burden on VA liaisons to provide support that would reasonably be considered clinical supervision.  The Contractor is expected to provide routine, ongoing clinical supervision to its staff working on this contract.  The VA Liaison will provide clinical oversight in the manner described.
Contractor will have general liability insurance coverage of $5 Million to $10 Million to cover employee malfeasance.
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The period of performance for this contract will be for a Base Year   plus four (4) Option Years.
CONTRACT TYPE: Firm Fixed Rate.   
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Work will be performed at the contractor s facility in the Bronx, New York. Government furnished workspace will not be provided for this effort.  However, the contractor will be required to attend frequent meetings and planning sessions at the Bronx VA medical center.  
GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY:  Government furnished property will not be provided to the Contractor.   All equipment required by the Contractor will provided at their expense.

<AWARDEE>Wartsila Defense Inc.
<DESC>Contract specialist conducted market research using online search. Keywords "rudder bearing seal" and "seal ring, split" were used to determine if AbilityOne, Unicor, NIB and GSA Advantage could support the requirement. All searches came back with zero results or results not comparable to requirement. An identical keyword search was also conducted using Google search engine with few useful results. Instead, multiple Google results pointed to other sole source justifications (N3904018P0016, SPMYM218Q3692, NMAN7200-16-01105) citing Wartsila Defense Incorporated (Wartsila) for similar requirements. A sole source justification was included in the procurement package from the requiring activity. The company provided was Wartsila, a sole source distributer/manufacturer of the requested supplies. Contained in the justification was a Work Specification Package that included a technical manual for item number 562-11-001 (Rudder Bearing Seal and Rudderstock Seal; repair). Per TPPC-DDG84- MARMCN19-CN01 section 1.3, Wartsila is listed as the manufacturer for all parts in this requirement.  Additionally, more recent procurements (August 2018) have found similar results, confirming that Wartsila is the sole source provider for these supplies. This has been accompanied by a signed letter from Wartsila's General Sales Manager detailing that companies are not authorized to sell or represent their products. Contract Specialist concluded this is a commercial product requirement referencing FAR 2.101 definitions (Commercial item). Based on market research conducted and sole source justification, it is clear Wartsila is the only company to offer this product to both Government and civilian customers. For this acquisition, firm fixed price contract with NAICS 336611 (SBA size 1,250 employees) will be awarded.
