<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis with Interactive Drama Inc. (IDI) of Bethesda, MD, to produce three individual virtual dialogue programs featuring Drs. Marshall W. Niremberg, Joshua Lederberg, and C. Everett Koop, scientists who have been inducted into NLM’s Profiles in Science.  The virtual dialogue programs will preserve the personae, personalities, and experiences of these extraordinary men, making them available for personal dialogue with Library visitors.  The programs will allow users to get to know these scientists and understand their accomplishments through personal, “face-to-face” interviews with them.  Through these programs, these esteemed scientists will be perpetually available for conversation at the National Library of Medicine. It is currently planned that these historical multimedia programs will be made available to the general public and researchers in the National Library of Medicine’s Visitors Center.  Tasks to be performed under this procurement include:  (1)  A full text transcript of each interview must be delivered to NLM for review and approval.  (2)  In compliance with the ADA Section 508, a second version of each program must be completed such that all video portions of these programs have synchronized captioning to accompany the audio portions of the program.  (3)  In compliance with the ADA Section 508, the vendor will provide a version of each program which operates by mouse activation and provides full captioning. This is required in order to provide access to those with hearing and speech impairments as well as those whose accents may prevent them from being “understood” by the speech detection software.  (4)  An online guide or “help” section is required to instruct users in the use of these programs. As part of that guide, a “troubleshooting” section addressing potential technical problems should be included with answers.  (5)  A description of all system hardware and software requirements is required, together with the names of off-the-shelf software used to create these programs in order that NLM can access appropriate resources for maintaining and/or repairing these programs.  (6)  Complete unedited video taped interviews of all interviewees must be delivered to NLM in high definition video format.  IDI is uniquely qualified to perform the above tasks by virtue of the knowledge, expertise, and experience it has acquired.  Under a Small Business Innovation Research contract with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, IDI utilized the Conversim® multimedia program model integrating speech recognition software to input queries to interviewees, thus providing these one-of-a-kind virtual dialogue programs.  IDI uses proprietary programming techniques and unique production rules for yielding the broad range of targeted responses from each subject.  IDI has provided the Conversim® program to the NLM for use in its Visitors Center so that people who come to the Library can interact with Dr. Donald A. B. Lindberg, current Director of the NLM through a one-on-one, “face-to-face” dialogue with him in cyberspace.  Other programs in the series have also been provided by IDI for use in the NLM Visitors Center.  Congressman Major Owens and Senator John Glenn also participated as interviewees in the series, and their programs are in the NLM Visitors Center.  Additionally, the NLM has funded the development of a virtual dialogue program featuring Dr. Julius Axelrod, which has been completed by IDI and will be placed in the Visitors Center in the near future.  IDI is to use the unique design templates created for the above programs in this new procurement.  The proposed acquisition is a small business set aside and will be procured under FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial items.  The period of performance is one year from the effective date.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however all responsive sources may submit a capabilities statement in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM.  The capabilities statement should demonstrate that the interested party is able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  All capabilities statements received in response to this notice will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria:  Criterion 1: (40%)  Evidence of experience in the production and programming of digital interactive dialog multimedia for public access, using speech recognition technology.  Criterion 2: (30%)  Evidence of experience conducting and videotaping extended, in-depth interviews with esteemed experts in the biological sciences.  Criterion 3: (30%)  Evidence of experience in developing knowledge databases from unscripted, spontaneous responses from experts on scientific and medical subjects.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within 8 (eight) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information.  NLM synopsis No. 05-046/MGK shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Michael Kapsilis, Contract Specialist at (301) 496-6546.

<DESC>The Department plans to procure contract services from Advanced Technology Systems, Inc. to provide operations, corrective maintenance, and transition support for the Tenant Rental Assistance Certification System (TRACS) on a sole sources basis.  The anticipated period of performance is 4 months.  Currently, a competitive procurement process for the award of a new contract for the system is underway. The proposed procurement will act as bridge to continue services until the competitive procurement is awarded. The Tenant Rental Assistance Certification System (TRACS) is the project management tool for HUD’s Office of Multifamily Housing, providing direct on-line support to field project managers, Headquarters staff, and Contract Administrators.  TRACS is the official source of data on Multifamily Housing’s portfolio of rental assistance programs.  Operations and corrective maintenance support will enable the system to process contracts and tenant certifications and to authorize monthly assistance payments without interruption.  Competition of the required services to continue operations of the system during the procurement process at this time, would put the program at risk and result in unacceptable delays or stoppage of the agency’s critical requirements of TRACS.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-2.  Interested persons may identify their interest to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all responses received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The contract type is anticipated to be firm fixed-price.

<DESC>NOTE:  In accordance with the Agreement of Defense and Cooperation between the Kingdom of Spain and the United States of America, any contract resulting from this notice/solicitation can only be entered into with companies authorized to carry out these activities in Spain under Spanish law.  Companies must meet the requirements established by Spanish legislation for execution of Government works.  Obtaining a license or permission to operate your company in Spain may be a long process; therefore, any company anticipating interest in future projects should immediately begin the processes that will be required, by contacting the Delegation of Industry.  They have two offices; one in the Madrid province and one in the Andalucia province.  The telephone numbers are: 011 34 91 580 2100 (Madrid) and 011 34 95 507 8620 for Andulucia.  The Air Force intends to solicit proposals for a Firm-Fixed Price contract on the High Intensity Runway Lighting (HIRL) project.  Contract magnitude is between $250,000 and $500,000.  The successful contractor will be selected using Past Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPPT) procedures resulting in the best value to the Government.  Past Performance will be rated significantly higher than price.  You are requested to notify the contracting officer, lisa.gambrel@moron.af.mil if you intend to download the solicitation.  It is highly recommended that you register to be notified of any new postings for this pre-solicitation notice and or any other postings published by our office.  However, remember that the notification of changes that result from registration is only a service and any failure of the service to notify you of changes cannot be used against the Government in any way, shape, or form.  Therefore, you should check EPS frequently for any new postings that may have been made.  As a last resort, if you cannot download the pre-solicitation from the EPS internet site, we can provide a CD ROM Disk, however, you must provide at least two working day notice (workdays are Monday through Friday except Spanish and American holidays) of your request for a CD ROM Disk to the above e-mail address or via fax at 95 584 8054.

If you do not already have one, it is suggested you contact Dunn and Bradstreet at www.dnb.com/dunsno/whereduns.htm or www.dun.es/.  Failure to have a DUNS Number at the time of award may delay the award, and depending on the criticality of the project, may be cause to award to the next qualified offeror who has a valid DUNS Number.  All contractors are advised that they should be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Registration can be made on line at http://www.ccr2000.com/.  NOTE:  You must have a DUNS Number to register.  Furthermore, in accordance with Section L, Provision L-204, a COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT ENTITY (CAGE) CODE REPORTING is required.

<DESC>THIS IS A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL NOTICE PUBLISHED UNDER SOLICITATION NUMBER GS06P05GZC0007(N).      THE LAST THREE CHARACTERS OF THE SOLICITATION NUMBER HAVE BEEN DELETED SO THE LINK TO FEDTEDS COULD BE ESTABLISHED.  THE SOLICITAION NUMBER IS NOW GS06P05GZC0007.          THIS IS THE SOLICITATION NOTICE.        RFTP IS NOW AVAILABLE.     SEE DETAILS BELOW.        NO HARD COPIES WILL BE PROVIDED.     

The project is a continuation of a four-phase program to renovate an 18-story office building.     Approximately 188,000 gross square feet of the 1.2 million gross square foot building will be renovated in this project.     Estimated award range is $20,000,000 to $30,000,000.     Completion time is 715 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about August 29, 2005.     This contract is restricted and limited to only those firms having (1) an existing general construction contracting office as of the date of this announcement within the four state region     consisting of Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska; (2) meeting the minimum requirement of having worked on a similar or partially similar project ? defined as an interior office renovation or other renovation project with a high level of interior finishes and complexity (new construction projects will not be evaluated); (3) a hazardous materials abatement subcontractor whose on-site supervisors for this project possess the Supervisor / Missouri State Certificate for Asbestos Related Occupations and their most recent required refresher training certificate; and (4) a data wiring subcontractor whose on-site supervisor for this project has been certified by Building Industry Consulting Services International, Inc. (BICSI).

This project will be limited to floors 11 through 14; miscellaneous lobby work on floors 15, 16 and 18; and stair towers on floors 11 through 18.     The building will be occupied during construction, however floors 13 and 14 will be initially vacant.     The 12th floor tenant will vacate the floor and move to 14 after completion of 14th floor work, the 11th floor tenant will move to 13, the 10th floor tenant will move to 12 and the 9th floor tenant will move to 11.     Limited above ceiling work on the 10th floor generally related to 11th floor plumbing is also required.     Base Bid Work:     Generally consists of general demolition, and asbestos and lead paint abatement; reconfiguration of existing shaft openings; seismic bracing of shaft walls; complete renovation of lobbies and restrooms including reconfiguration of restrooms; wood paneling, terrazzo, drywall partitions, paint and plaster, new ceramic tile walls and floors; new ceilings, lighting and above ceiling HVAC throughout the floor; and new building signage/graphics.     Option Bid Work:     Generally consists of tenant improvements including new drywall partitions, doors, frames and hardware, plaster, paint, vinyl tile, carpet and vinyl base, casework, new panel boards, tenant power distribution and data drops; computer room chiller; meeting certification standards to qualify for a LEED Certified rating; stairway egress improvements; and Building Automation System work.     Phased substantial completion dates are required.

Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos abatement shall satisfy special competencies and provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.     Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.     The Government will not indemnify against such risk.     Construction work disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed outside of normal business hours.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures.     The Government intends to use the ?trade-off process? in selecting the prime contractor.     The ?trade-off process? is a method of evaluating both the technical factors specified in the solicitation, the price and an optional in-person interview.     For this solicitation, the goal is to select the proposal that offers the best combination of technical qualifications, price and an optional interview.     The Government intends to award the contract to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, with technical factors being considered more important than price. The object is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price. Proposals will be evaluated in three stages.     Stage One, the Request for Technical Proposals (RFTP) will be issued on or about 01-24-05.     The RFTP will consist of technical evaluations to establish those within a competitive range. The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel, (3) Management Plan, and (4) Sustainable Construction Materials and Methods.     Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality.     Offerors whose proposals fall within the competitive range will be invited by the Government to make Stage Two submissions, which shall consist of Pricing, a subcontracting plan and special competency requirements. Offerors whose technical evaluations do not meet minimum requirements will be notified by phone or letter that they will not be allowed to submit a price proposal. Offerors whose technical evaluations are not in the competitive range will also be so notified; however their price proposals will still be received and evaluated. Pricing Packages will be issued on or about April 11, 2005.     Initial Price proposals will be received in this office on or about May 20, 2005. Offerors should submit Stage Two price proposals that are acceptable without additional information, as the Government may make the final determination regarding a proposal?s acceptability based solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted. The Government may proceed with the award of the contract without discussion. However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors. A request for final price proposals will be issued on or about May 29, 2005.     The offeror with the highest technical rank and the lowest price will be considered the most advantageous.     If the ranks of two or more offerors are approximately equal, the higher technical proposal will be the offer considered most advantageous. As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price then becomes more important.     If the selection board deems it necessary or desirable, they may invite selected firms to an in-person interview, which shall constitute Stage Three. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the combination of technical qualifications, price and the interview, if held, that is the most advantageous to the Government. The Government will evaluate all proposals that meet the minimum requirements.     

The Request for Technical Proposal (RFTP) includes a general scope of work, completed Design Development level drawings and outline specifications, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.     In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS).     GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch (6PCA), will no longer mail hardcopies of construction solicitations and amendments.     The solicitation (specifications and drawings) and its amendments will only be available through a link in FedBizOpps to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.     Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.     Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov ) and then with FEDTeDS (www.fedteds.gov ).     As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry (www.FedBizOpps.gov) but the sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information (specifications and drawings) will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.     The drawings are being provided as .DWG and .PDF files.     Drawings can be viewed from Autodesk.     Bidders are responsible for producing their own print sets for their use.       

Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.     At minimum, all vendors must supply the following information: 

1.       Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) which you should obtain from your Company's CCR Point of Contact, 
2.       Your Company's DUNS Number (800-333-0505 if you do not have one) or CAGE Code 
3.       Your Company?s Tax ID Number, 
4.       Your Telephone Number, and 
5.       Your E-Mail Address.     

Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.

Your CCR registration should take approximately 48 hours for processing and activation.     Once you have registered with CCR you may then register with FEDTeDS to view solicitations.     No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.     You may register with FEDTeDS via the following URL https://www.fedteds.gov/.     If you have not used the site previously, please go to "Register with FedTeds" and read the Vendor User Guide.     The official planholders list will be based on only those requesting specifications through FedTeDS. 

There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference on or about, February 15, 2005, at 10:00 a.m., local time, in room N133 of the Richard Bolling Federal Building, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri.     Proposals will be received on Tuesday, March 1, 2005, at 2:00 p.m., local time.     Specific location is specified in the RFTP.     Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.     The Government will evaluate submissions to establish those within a competitive range.

Prior to award of contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.     Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.

The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.     All responsible sources not limited by the restrictions stated in the first paragraph may submit an offer, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.     Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.     FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.     

The RFTP specification and Construction Documents are available ONLY by link via this announcement.     The list of planholders will be based only on those requesting the Proposal Documents via FEDTeDS (see above) through the link contained in this announcement.     Those requesting drawings, plans, and/or specifications must first register at www.ccr.gov.     Contact Sharon Clisso, Contract Specialist, for questions concerning this announcement at 816-823-2319 or fax her at 816-926-3571.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is available on both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site located at http://www.eps.gov or http://www.fedbizopps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. The Program Executive Office Littoral Mine Warfare - Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Program Office (PMS 403), Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC, is soliciting new and innovative concepts in the development and demonstration of technologies applicable to UUVs. The growing use of unmanned systems in the air, on the ground, or underwater continually demonstrates new possibilities/capabilities to maintain our naval forces’ maritime superiority around the world. One can conceive scenarios where UUVs sense, track, identify, target, and destroy an enemy -- all autonomously within the full net-centric battlespace. The long-term UUV vision is to have the capability to (1) deploy or retrieve devices; (2) gather, transmit, and act on all types of information; and (3) engage bottom, volume, surface, air or land targets.  To this end, the Navy is soliciting proposals in the following areas:  (1)	Autonomy. Autonomy is needed to support long, complex missions in unpredictable or harsh environments. It includes the need to make independent decisions based on the mission goals, environmental conditions, and remaining energy on-board. Additional needed capabilities include the need to avoid obstacles and entanglements, to react to changes in ambient conditions, and to engage in group behavior when multiple UUVs act as a team.  (2)	Energy and Propulsion. Low-cost, high energy density, reliable, safe, long-duration easily recharged or refueled power sources are needed. Energy source for air-independent power is desired to minimize the size, cost, and signature of the energy and propulsion system. Advanced energy and propulsion, in combination with other UUV technologies, will enable the use of smaller vehicles that reduce cost in the long term while providing greater performance.  (3)	Advanced Sensors and Sensors Processing. All UUV missions depend on the effective use of sensors. Development in the sensor area needs to be concentrated in increasing area coverage rate (ACR), improving classification and identification capabilities, employment and packaging of low-power electronics, non-traditional tracking techniques, and multi-threat chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological, and explosive (CBNRE) sensors.  (4)	Communications and Networking. Real-time, or near real-time, RF communications of sensor data from the vehicle in operational sea states is needed. Acoustic or other (e.g. laser) underwater communication technologies to provide communications at useful data rates and provide navigation aids on demand are desired.  (5)	Launch and Recovery. Launch and Recovery (L&R) is a key feature of any UUV system, and it is closely related to the vehicle size and host platform characteristics. Development of innovative multi-platform L&R concepts, as well as deployment and possible recovery of payloads from host UUV, are desired.     (6)	Engagement and Intervention. The development of technology is necessary to support net extraction. Engagement and intervention techniques are required for a wide range of missions, particularly those requiring long transits and interactions with targets. The UUV missions envisioned may require solutions that range from non-lethal to neutralization.  (7)	Modeling and Simulation. Modeling and simulation are needed for UUV mission planning and reconstruction, vehicle testing, software design and testing, and training. This BAA will be open for one year from the date of the announcement. Proposals may be submitted at any time within that period.  Contracts and “other transactions” may be awarded, as appropriate, and will be limited by funding availability. Therefore, early submission of proposals is desirable and encouraged. Navy evaluation will commence after 1 March 2005 and initial awards are anticipated in third quarter FY05. Proposals should be submitted to: COMMANDER, Naval Sea Systems Command, ATTN: Code 02633, James E. Watkins, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue, S.E., Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC 20376.  Contracting Point of Contact is James E. Watkins, telephone (202) 781-3957, e-mail WatkinsJE@navsea.navy.mil. This synopsis constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) per FAR 6.102(d)(2)(i); there will be no formal request for proposals (RFP) or other solicitation in regard to this announcement.     Because both the technical and cost aspects of an offeror's submission will be evaluated at the same time, it is desirable that one volume containing all information be submitted. In presenting the proposal material, prospective offerors are advised that quality of the information is significantly more important than the quantity. Therefore, offerors are requested to confine their submissions to essential matters, providing sufficient information to define their offer and establish an adequate basis for the Government to conduct its evaluation. Offerors may submit their proposals (two paper copies and ten electronic copies on CD using Microsoft Office 2000 or earlier).  Respondents must be able to certify that they have an appropriate facility clearance to meet the security requirements of work proposed, and key personnel must be certified as holding an appropriate clearance. Proposals shall consist of one volume consisting of the technical proposal, management approach, and!  cost. The technical proposal is limited to 20 pages exclusive of the Statement of Work (paragraph (7), below) and cost information, which has no page limit. Pages are to be 8.5 x 11 inch, single-sided. Minimum font is 10 point. Succinct proposals are desired.  The technical portion shall consist of the following sections, each starting on a new page:  (1) A cover page, including proposal title, technical and administrative points-of-contact along with the telephone and facsimile numbers, followed by a letter signed by the authorized officer specifying the proposal validity period (at least 120 days); (2) An Executive Overview of the proposed technologies and/or concepts as well as any innovative claims for the proposed research, and how they will contribute to and support the objectives of a technology evaluation and demonstration; (3) A detailed technical proposal of the primary precepts of the concept with appropriate elaboration as to the ingenuity associated with the co! ncept. This section shall not exceed 10 pages. (4) A summary of the deliverables including data associated with the proposed research. (5) A summary of the schedule and milestones for the proposed effort that can be traced to the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). (6) A one-page WBS. (7) A succinct Statement of Work clearly detailing the scope and objectives of the work and, if any, specific contractor requirements. The statement of work should only document the specific work to be performed as discussed in section (3) above. Any disclosure of information as relating to the merits of the concept included in the Statement of Work but not included in the detailed technical proposal required by paragraph (3) above will not be considered for award selection. If any portion of the proposed effort is predicated upon the use of Government-owned resources of any type, the contractor shall clearly identify: the resources required, the date the resource is required, the duration of the r! equirement, the source from which the resource may be acquired, if known, and the impact on the effort if the resource is not provided. (8) A description of the results, products, and transferable technology expected from the contract. This section should specifically address any intellectual property claims associated with the outcome of this effort. (9) A brief discussion of past performance detailing previous accomplishments and work in this or closely related research areas, previous cost and schedule performance, and the qualifications of the previous key personnel. (10) A brief discussion of the overall approach to the management of this effort, including brief discussions of total organization, use of personnel and their qualifications, project/function/subcontractor relationships, technology transition plans, government interfaces, and planning, scheduling, and control practices. The cost portion shall include the one-page work breakdown structure, a cost summary, an! d a detailed breakdown of cost for the effort. The selection of proposals for contract award will be based on a scientific review of proposals submitted in response to each BAA. The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the technical approach of each proposal. Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation. Selection of proposals for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of funds. Specific evaluation criteria are as follows:  (1)	Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to PMS403 programs are proposed, their feasibility, and the offeror's understanding of the proposed approach and technical objectives. It is desirable that the developments be structured in phases to allow assessment and/or decision points, where allowable;  (2)	The offeror's ability to implement the proposed approach as demonstrated by specific accomplishments in the technical field to be studied, the qualifications (including past performance) of the proposed principal investigator and other personnel, and the availability of appropriate facilities;  (3)	The degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed contract are to be delivered to NAVSEA with rights compatible with NAVSEA research and development objectives; and (4)	The extent to which offerors identify and commit to small businesses and to small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, women-owned small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, or other minority institution participation in the proposed effort, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor relationship.  THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED.

This pre-solicitation notice is for information purposes only.  Solicitation documents will not be available for downloading until approximately March 15, 2005.  This solicitation is 100% set-aside for 8(a) firms servicing the SBA Illinois District Office. The NAICS Code for work under this contract is  236220.

The preponderance of the work in this contract will be maintenance and repair work, and occasional new construction with some design capability required.  The Government may choose to award the contract based on initial solicitation technical factors without holding discussions; the Government additionally reserves the right to reject any or all submittals at any time prior to award.  The contract contains a base year of twelve-months and two twelve-month options for a total maximum duration of thirty-six months for a maximum value of $10 million per year for all three indefinite quantity contractors.  The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about March 15, 2005.

Task orders will range in size from $100,000 to $3,000,000.  Task orders placed on this contract may include 1) 100% design; 2) performance specifications; or 3) may require the contractor to do necessary design work.  Please note that a bid bond will be required for each task order proposal.     Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.   Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value trade-off or low price and technically acceptable methodologies.   If the Government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order.   Should the newly awarded IDIQ contractor be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.

Design or Engineering Services are required for an Indefinite Quantity Contract for Environmental Planning and Engineering Services for National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Executive Order (EO) 12114, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions.  The geographic area covered by this contract encompasses the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Atlantic's area of responsibility (AOR) and the adjacent waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  The preponderance of the work on this contract is anticipated to occur within NAVFAC Atlantic's AOR, which includes the Continental United States, the Caribbean, Europe and North Africa.  Taskings, however, could be assigned anywhere in the world.

The documents to be prepared under this contract include:  Categorical Exclusions (CATEX), Environmental Assessments (EA) and Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) under NEPA, as well as Environmental Reviews and Environmental Studies under EO 12114.  The preponderance of work to be assigned under this contract will be NEPA documentation in support of proposed infrastructure-related actions.  However, other tasks may be assigned.  Some examples of taskings could include home basing of aircraft, home basing of ships, new construction, renovation, and Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions and demolitions.  General guidelines for preparation of the NEPA documentation are contained in the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations (40 CFR part 1500 et. seq.) and Navy Instructions as published, 32 CFR Part 775 and OPNAVINST 5090.1B.  Guidance for preparing EO 12114 documents is contained in OPNAVINST 5090.1B, Appendix E.  In order to complete these documents, some of the following related studies and services may be required:  (1) Air Conformity Analyses under the Clean Air Act; (2) Wetland delineation and mitigation plans; (3) Cultural resource surveys (both architectural and archeological); (4) Coastal Zone Management consistency determinations; (5) Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultations, Biologic Surveys and Biological Assessments; (6) Community Impact Studies; (7) Environmental Justice Analyses; (8) Traffic Studies; (9) Water quality studies to include chemical and physical analysis of dredge material and bioassays; (10) Storm Water Management Studies; (11) Noise impact studies; (12) Toxic and hazardous waste studies; (13) Public Involvement Strategies; (14) Life Cycle Cost Analyses; (15) Land Use Compatibility (LUC) Plans; (16) Natural Resources Surveys; (17) Translation services for CATEX/EA/EIS and Public Notices; (18) Range hazard analysis; (19) At-sea acoustic analysis; (20) Marine Resource Assessments; (21) Marine Mammal Density estimates (22) Letters of Authorization and Incidental Harassment Authorizations; and (23) Essential Fish Habitat Assessments.

The contract requires that the selected firm have on-line access to E-mail via the Internet for routine exchange of correspondence.

The A&E must demonstrate his and each key consultant's qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors for all services.  Evaluation Factors (1) through (5) are of equal importance; factors (6), (7) and (8) are of lesser importance and will be used as tie-breakers among technically equal firms.  Specific evaluation factors include:

1.  Specialized Experience:  Firms and consultants, if proposed, will be evaluated in terms of their past experience with regard to the preparation of the above listed environmental documents and related studies and their knowledge of environmental regulations pertaining to this type of work.

2.  Professional Qualifications and Technical Competence of the staff assigned to this contract for the type of work addressed in Evaluation Factor #1:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of the staff's active professional registration, and the capability to provide qualified backup staffing for key personnel to ensure continuity of services and ability to surge to meet unexpected project demands.

3.  Ability to perform the work to schedules and capacity to accomplish up to 3 concurrent taskings per year.  Firms will be evaluated in terms of impact of this workload on the staff's projected workload during the contract period.

4.  Past Performance:  Firms will be evaluated in past performance with respect to work quality, compliance with schedules, and cost control (with emphasis on projects addressed in Evaluation Factor 1).  Firms should demonstrate long term business relationships and repeat business with Government and private customers along with appropriate points of contact.  Firms should include any letters of commendation or awards.

5.  Quality Control Program:  Firms will be evaluated on the acceptability of their internal quality control program used to ensure technical accuracy and discipline coordination of plans and specifications - list key personnel responsible.

6.  Firm location (provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract).  Firms will be evaluated on their location with respect to the general geographical area of the contract and their knowledge of local codes, laws, permits and construction practices of the area of the contract.  This evaluation factor applies to the office that will perform the work and not general office locations that will not be performing work under this contract.

7.  Volume of Work:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by DOD within the past 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.

8.  Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan:  Firms will be evaluated on the extent to which they identify and commit to the published Small Business Subcontracting Program.  The Secretary of the Navy has assigned the Naval Facilities Engineering Command goals expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars for utilization of small businesses of 74.8%.  Included in the SB goals are targets for:  Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) - 15.5%; Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) - 14.0%; Veterans Owned Small Business (VOSB) - 3%; Services Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) - 3%; and HUBZone Small Business - 3.1%.

The total amount that may be paid under this contract (including option years) will not exceed $20,000,000 for the entire contract term.  The minimum guarantee for the entire contract term (including option years) will be satisfied by the award of the initial Task Order.  The options may be exercised within the time frame specified in the resultant contract at the sole discretion of the Government subject to workload and/or satisfaction of the A&E performance under the subject contract.  There will be no dollar limit per task order and no dollar limit per year.  No other general notification to firms for other similar projects performed under this contract will be made.  Type of contract:  Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Quantity Contract.  Estimated start date is April 2005.  This proposed contract is being solicited on an unrestricted basis; therefore, replies to this notice are requested from all business concerns.  The small business size standard classification is NAICS 541330 ($4,000,000).

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel.: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009; PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop technical assistance for GNSS implementation in six South American countries.

The Technical Assistance is designed to support the Latin American Civil Aviation Commission (LACAC), an international organization comprised of Latin American and Caribbean civil aviation authorities, in carrying out the Global Navigation Satellite Surveillance (GNSS) Implementation Program in six South American countries. The countries involved in the GNSS Implementation Program are Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay.

Sponsored by the Federal Aviation Administration, the GNSS Implementation Program is a turn-key approach to developing procedures using the Global Positioning System (GPS) as the primary navigational signal for aircraft. The GNSS Implementation Program plans to provide thirteen key airports in six countries with a modular implementation for a total system approach. The approach includes developing a legislative framework, development of the GPS-based instrument approach procedures, service provider training, and user education for the new procedures.  

Specifically, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) grant will fund two modules of a ten-module GNSS Implementation Program in six South American countries. The countries involved in the program are Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. The first module funded by the grant will support World Geodetic Standard 1984 (WGS-84) verification for 13 airports in the six participating countries, while the second module will provide training on the requirements and benefits of GNSS implementation. The training module will be conducted with support from the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The successful Offeror must subcontract with IATA to carry out the second module.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Technical Assistance include the following tasks:
Task 1: WGS-84 Survey Module: a) Review existing survey information and prior WGS-84 fieldwork surveys for each airport; b) Determine amount of required fieldwork to develop approach and departure procedures based on existing verifiable information, and confirm and document the validity of existing information; c) Discuss the intended approach/departure procedure development with each of the six States to determine special requirements or surveying information that would be necessary to document; d) Reference published airport survey criteria to support the implementation of satellite-based navigation; e) Accomplish fieldwork through a surveyor licensed in the U.S. that has previous experience at conducting WGS-84 surveys; f) Complete a planimetric survey of the aerodromes, gathering items and elements necessary to produce or revise various aerodrome charts; and g) Acquire pertinent information on the airport needed for development of approach/departure procedures.
Task 2: GNSS/RNAV Training Module (to be conducted by the designated subcontractor, IATA): a) Review of GNSS/RNAV principles; b) Identification of benefits from GNSS/RNAV safety and operating developments; c) Current GNSS: description of system architecture, approved operations, procedures development, operating requirements, and examples of GNSS implementation; d) Future GNSS: additional operations, benefits and operating requirements; e) Implementation considerations: evaluation of GNSS equipment, cost/benefit analyses, importance of CNS/ATM and development of a GNSS implementation plan; and f) Other topics as appropriate.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $548,600 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background Desk Study report, is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFP's received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SOLNBR>W9127N-05-B-0007
<RESPDATE>021505
<ARCHDATE>04162005
<CONTACT>Courtney Jones, 503-808-4630
<DESC>This Invitation for Bid (IFB) is for maintenance dredging work at Depoe Bay Boat Basin and an adjacent sediment catch basin located at the city of Depoe Bay, Lincoln County, Oregon.  Within the boat basin proper, a hydraulic cutterhead pipeline dredg e shall be employed to remove an estimated maximum pay volume of 18,000 cubic yards of dense infill material including lesser amounts of trash and debris commonly found at public boat basin facilities.  The boat basin shall be dredged to a required grade o f -9 feet MLLW with one foot of allowable (paid) over-depth. All boat basin material shall be placed within a Government furnished inter-tidal disposal site.  The average dimensions of the boat basin are 750 feet long by 390 feet wide.  The average pumping  distance to the inter-tidal site is approximately 1,000 feet.  The catch basin shall be dredged to a required depth of +3 feet MLLW with an allowable 1 foot (paid) over-depth (+2 feet).  The catch basin contains an estimated maximum pay volume of 1,500 cu bic yards of loose infill material including lesser amounts of small wood debris such as bark and sticks.  The catch basin material may be excavated by either hydraulic or mechanical means.  Due to the catch basin's relatively small size (100ft x 90ft) exc avation by hydraulic means will require equipment supplemental to the primary plant such as a small hydraulic dredge, submersible pump, or like equipment.  If hydraulic equipment is employed, the material must be transported to the inter-tidal site without  intermediate stockpiling within the boat basin proper or adjacent areas.  Catch basin material may also be excavated by mechanical means, such as, clamshell or hydraulic excavator and dump trucks with final placement of material at a confined upland site furnished by the Port of Depoe Bay.  Dredging of the catch basin was last accomplished in February of 2000 by use of a lattice boom crane and clamshell bucket.  Material was transported and placed within a sponsor furnished upland site by cycling conventio nal dump trucks with sealed beds.  The one-way haul distance to the sponsor furnished site was approximately two miles. Payment for dredging and disposal of material from both the boat basin and catch basin areas will be based on a cubic yard unit price an d for only that material which is removed from within the designated dredging pay area limits. A Site Safety and Health Officer (SSHO) shall be provided for all new contracts with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District.  For this project the person that will act as the SSHO is required to have a minimum of 3 years safety work on similar  projects and a 30-Hour OSHA construction safety class, or equivalent, taken within the last 3 years.  The SSHO may have other duties for this work that include being the Contractor on-site Project Manager and/or the on-site CQC Manager or other responsibl e individual. Administrative lead is George Williams, (503) 808-4615, email george.w.williams@nwp.usace.army.mil.  Technical lead is Chad Linna, (503) 808-4355, chad.linna@usace.army.mil. The Magnitude of Construction is between $100,000.00 and $250,000.00.  This solici tation will be issued on CD Rom format at no charge and will be available on or about February 15, 2005.  To receive a copy of this solicitation, plan-holders must register on our website https://nwp.usace.army.mil.  Tentative bid opening will be on or abo ut March 17, 2005.

POC:  Marcia Goldman, Contract Specialist (301) 496-2302 
DESC:  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical and customer service capabilities of small businesses interested in providing dosimetry services to NIH. NIH possesses a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license authorizing its use of radioactive materials that includes requirements for performing routine monitoring for external occupational exposure, notification of individuals and their supervisors when exposures approach maximum permissible limits, and making recommendations for remedial action whenever appropriate.  Independently, and not as an agent of the Government (the Customer), the Contractor shall furnish the personnel, labor, facilities, equipment, parts, materials, and supplies necessary to provide a comprehensive external exposure monitoring program, including associated services, in accordance with the requirements of the NIH license.  Through the Division of Radiation Safety (DRS), the Office of Research Services (ORS) provides radiation exposure monitoring services to NIH employees who utilize radioactive materials and radiation producing equipment in the course of their research.  The ORS is seeking organizations that can provide state of the art dosimetry equipment, timely reading and reporting of the monitoring results, and a comprehensive, interactive database from which historical and regulatory data may be readily obtained.  The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS Code 541380 size standard  10.0 million.  The ORS intends to award a new contract to the dosimetry provider whose services most adequately support the programs and the needs of the NIH.  Services that will be required by this procurement will include, but are not limited to, the furnishing of all personnel, labor, facilities, equipment, parts, materials, and supplies considered essential for providing all specified types of personal and environmental dosimeters, including dosimeter calibration, monitoring, and necessary associated services in accordance with NIH requirements.  These requirements shall include maintaining a Certificate of Accreditation from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) through its National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) for all test categories applicable to whole-body, extremity, and environmental dosimeters.  Additional requirements include the ability to utilize existing NIH methodology for record keeping and identification of employees and lab groups, permitting direct computer access to personnel monitoring database(s) by DRS personnel, participation in a joint QA/QC program as directed by the DRS, and providing dosimetry equipment that is hermetically sealed such that it permits gas and/or liquid wash sterilization while guarding against damage from water and laboratory chemicals.  Additionally, qualified businesses should demonstrate a propensity for the development and incorporation of innovative and efficiency-improving systems, products, and customer service into their proposed dosimetry service.   An example would be the availability of operational or electronic dosimeter systems that allow for on-site management of personnel exposures.  Experience in managing similar dosimetry service contracts must be demonstrated. This market survey is being conducted through the CBD to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information. Responding firms should provide two (2) copies of their capability statement to the Office of Procurement Management at the address provided not later than February 7, 2005. Please send to the attention of Marcia Goldman, 6011 Executive Blvd., Room 539A, Bethesda, Maryland  20892-7663



Basic Services:
 
1.  Whole Body Dosimeters:  Whole body monitoring systems will preferably use optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) or an equivalent technology.  The ideal system involves the use of a single monitor capable of detecting beta, gamma, and neutron radiations.  The monitor must be designed for "clip-on" attachment to a worker's clothing for use under normal conditions, but should also be versatile enough to be adaptable to other monitoring situations such as extremity-wrist, lens of eye, or area monitoring if required.  The system should possess a minimum reporting precision of 1 mrem with complete re-analysis capability to allow for dose measurement confirmation, it should incorporate a filtering mechanism that allows for differentiation between the various types and energies of radiation encountered, and it must be capable of qualitatively detecting and quantitatively measuring dose equivalents from low- and high-energy beta; low-, medium- and high-energy photon radiations; and neutrons in the thermal, intermediate, and fast ranges.  Accreditation must be in NVLAP categories I through VI as defined in ANSI/HPS N13.11 - 2001, Personnel Dosimetry Performance - Criteria for Testing.

A.  Minimum Reportable Doses:
(1) gamma, x ray -  1 mrem
(2) energetic beta -  10 mrem
(3) neutron -	 10 mrem thermal;  20 mrem fast
B.	Minimum Detectable Energies:
(1) gamma, x ray -  5 keV
(2) energetic beta -  150 keV
(3) neutron -  0.025 eV thermal;  0.5 eV to 144 keV intermediate;  > 144 keV fast
C.	Minimum Detection Ranges:
(1) low and high energy gamma, x ray -  1 mrem to 1000 rem
	(2)	beta -  10 mrem to 1,000 rem
(3)	neutron -  20 mrem to 25 rem
D.	Analysis and quantification above 1000 rem must be available upon request.
E.	Sterilization: Dosimeters should be hermetically sealed and if possible, capable of being sterilized by gases such as ethylene oxide, or by solutions such as Betadine, Cidex, Wescodyne, or other similar means without compromising the integrity or capability of the monitor. 

Whole Body Monitor Option:  The contractor may substitute or offer another currently available dosimetry technology as an alternative to the OSL system, providing that the performance characteristics and the information available from the dosimeter provide comparable quantitative and qualitative data such as: static vs. dynamic exposure, shielded exposure, (i.e. an image of the exposure is available).

2.  Extremity Dosimeter:  Ring dosimeters shall be available as extremity monitors.  OSL is preferred, however, monitoring may also be accomplished via thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) extremity finger monitors.  Monitors shall be designed either as an adjustable ring or supplied in a minimum of three sizes (small, medium, and large).  Rings shall be designed with a label that bears all necessary identifying information in such a manner that it is impervious to fading/smearing due to moisture/washing.  TLD dosimeters shall be manufactured of Harshaw TLD-100 LiF ribbon or equivalent that is near tissue equivalency, possessing high sensitivity, a low fade rate, and extreme durability.  Accreditation must be in NVLAP extremity categories I through IV as defined in ANSI/HPS N13.32 - 1995, Performance Testing of Extremity Dosimeters.


A.	Minimum Reportable Doses:
(1) gamma, x ray - 30 mrem
(2) energetic beta - 40 mrem
B.   Minimum energy sensitivity:
(1) gamma, x ray - 10 keV
(2) energetic beta - 200 keV
C.	Minimum Detection Ranges:
(1) low and high energy gamma, x ray - 30 mrem to 1,000 rem
(2) beta over 1 MeV - 50 mrem to 1,000 rem
D.	Analysis and quantification above 1000 rem must be available upon request. 
E.	Ultraviolet Sensitivity: possible exposure to UV radiation shall be minimized or eliminated by the use of UV absorbing materials.
F.	Sterilization: Rings must be capable of being sterilized by gases such as ethylene oxide, or by solutions such as Betadine, Cidex, Wescodyne, or other similar products without compromising the integrity or capability of the monitor. 

Extremity Ring OSL Option: The contractor may substitute or offer another currently available extremity ring monitor technology as an alternative to the OSL, providing that the performance characteristics and information available from the dosimeter meets or exceeds that provided by the ring monitor described above.

3.  Environmental Dosimeter:  Environmental TLDs are deployed on a quarterly basis and shall be capable of a minimal detectable exposure of approximately 1 mrem.  The dosimeter shall consist of a minimum of two (2) tissue equivalent TLD elements in a single holder, with packaging that is weatherproof and suitable for deployment, as is, in the normal environment (rain, snow, sun, etc.) without the need for additional weather protection or housings.  The devices shall be provided with an easily deployable mounting device or container which is tamper resistant and can be easily fastened to signs, trees, lamp posts, etc., through the use of wire ties, clips, or other non-permanent fasteners.  The color should be black or some other non-vibrant/dull color, and the label containing required identifying information must be resistant to smearing and/or fading as a result of exposure to extreme or continued inclement weather.  Accreditation must be in accordance with ANSI N545.

A.	Error Limits:  Measurement error should not exceed 100% at the 95% confidence level for exposures below 10 mrem/quarter; and 30% at the 95% confidence level for exposures above 10 mrem/quarter.
B.	Filtration:  Filtration shall be such that at least one element is provided with at least 250 mg/cm2 of filtration.  
C.	Fade:  The dosimeter's fade characteristics shall be such that the dosimeter will not fade in excess of ten percent (10%) per quarter.
D.	The dosimeter must be accurate, durable, and measure to 1 mrem ambient dose equivalent:

Type of	Energy of	Dose Range		
Radiation	Radiation	 ( rem )  	Error Limit (%) 
  		X-ray, gamma	     .05 - 2 MeV           .001 - 10	(see text above)

Environmental TLD Option:  The contractor may substitute or offer as an alternative another available Environmental Dosimeter technology, provided that the performance characteristics and information available from the dosimeter meets or exceeds that listed above.

4.	Quantity:  The following required quantities will change over the life of this contract, with stated estimates reflecting current program requirements. Continuing program and regulatory review will dictate necessary changes in specific requirements for contract option years.  It is not anticipated that the total number of persons monitored will vary by more than + 25% each year.

The contractor shall be able to provide weekly monitoring services for the following items:
Estimated  Qty
Whole body beta-gamma/neutron (OSL and/or TLD)	   10
	Extremity finger ring beta-gamma (TLD)	100

Each monthly shipment of dosimeters to the NIH campus shall also contain an extra 50 unassigned whole body monitors and 50 unassigned rings specifically designated as temporary employee issuances.  These numbers may change at the discretion of the DRS/Project Officer in order to meet seasonal demands.

Minimum software requirements:
-  Fully automated and capable of estimating and assigning doses based on exposure histories.  For example, in the event a previously absent dosimeter is received and processed, the software in use must allow the actual dosimeter data to supercede the estimated value.
-  Capable of providing both hard copy and electronic reports that fulfill the requirement for generating NRC Forms 4 and 5.
-  Establishment of individual and/or group ALARA reporting thresholds for exposure notifications on a wear period (weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly) and year to date cumulative basis.  (See Special Services section below for additional information related to this requirement.)
-  Software services shall be provided to the NIH main campus in Bethesda, MD, and its satellite facilities in Phoenix, AR and Hamilton, MT.  (Separate billing for software services will be required for the satellite facilities.)

-  The contractor shall electronically transmit all data to the DRS computer system within 5 working days after receipt of the monitors.  Data shall be transmitted to the DRS computer as soon as possible but absolutely no later than the mailing of corresponding written reports.
-  The Contractor must have database capabilities and/or software that allows for the generation of the following reports:
a.	Quarterly or annual statistical summaries of dosimeter exposures of individuals, series groups, or by all participants
b.	NRC Form 4 & 5 Reports or equivalent
c.	Missing dosimeter reports.
d.	Hardcopy dosimeter analysis reports.
e.	Secure reports that omit information that may be sensitive with regards to privacy issue concerns, social security number, birth date, etc.
f.	Electronic media reports including tape, diskette and/or CD-Rom.

3.  Packaging/Handling:
-  Prior to shipping, the Contractor will pre-sort the monitors into individual series groups for the purpose of distribution and reporting.
-  In addition to any identification requirement of the contractor, each permanently assigned monitor shall have a printed label with the user’s name, wear period, DRS ID, series code, and unique monitor serial number that uses a standard bar code protocol.
-  Monitors shall be furnished on a monthly or bi-monthly basis (except for a small number of weekly and quarterly monitors) and shall arrive at the specified installation at least seven working days prior to the end of the month.
-  All monitors for a series group shall be packaged in an individual envelope or box, with a label bearing all required identifying information attached to the outside of each package.
-  Each label shall display the DRS return address in the upper left corner with the series group address on the main body of the label.  
-  Shipping packages containing the monitors for each NIH account shall contain at least one control dosimeter.
-  The contractor shall, upon proper notification, accept requests for additional personnel monitoring services and fulfill these requests within seven working days after receipt.
-  The contractor shall supply replacements holders as requested by the Project Officer.  It is estimated that the NIH will require approximately 10 whole body beta-gamma holders per month.
4.  Personnel Services:  The Contractor shall provide personnel services onsite for 8 hours each normal work day, between the hours of 7:00 AM and 5:00 PM, to provide coordination and processing of personnel dosimeters.

<DESC>UPDATE, 26 JAN 05:  In response to RFP Technical Clarifications requests submitted by prospective offerors in accordance with RFP  Section L015, Government responses are hereby posted to the PIXS.   Some of these answers will result in administrative changes to the  RFP and will be posted via RFP Amendment 0001 within the next week.   Note:  No extension to the proposal submittal date will be authorized  in Amendment 0001.   UPDATE, 12 JAN 05:  The Bidders Library list has been posted.  If you need copies of files contained in the library, please contact Cheryle Lankford or Capt. Jason Ortiz.  A CD will be provided upon request. UPDATE, 12 JAN 05:  The final RFP is hereby released.  Also attached are the Acquisition Schedule and 2 PCO letters (Source Selection  Notification and Request for Proposal).  Please note Shannon Prince is no longer a POC for this effort.  The current POCs are:  Cheryle Lankford (937-904-4197), Capt. Jason Ortiz (937-904-4609) and Trini Rendon (937-904-4286). UPDATE, 3 JAN 05:  Regarding the Draft RFP posted 30 Dec 04, please be advised that the updated DRAFT RFP has a potential for up to a 10  year period of performance as opposed to the original 5 year period of performance.  All comments/questions to the current Draft RFP  should be received no later than 12:00 EST on 10 Jan 05.  The  Government may not respond with direct answers but may incorporate  comments into the Final RFP. UPDATE, 30 DEC 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) in response to the questions/comments to the DRFP posted 3 Nov 04.  Only documents with changes/updates are posted.  This includes the updated DRFP, Section L and Section M.  Blue change bars highlight changes made.  A document entitled "Industry Questions and Responses, 30 Dec 04" has also been posted.  Questions can be directed to Cheryle Lankford, 937-904-4197, or Capt. Jason Ortiz, 937-904-4609.  UPDATE, 24 NOV 04:  Our e-mail system went down November 12 and was out not fixed until sometime the following week.  As a result, some e-mail  was lost.  If you sent an e-mail responding to the draft RFP during that  time, it may not have been received.  If an e-mail was sent and you did not receive any response from our office advising receipt of the e-mail, please resubmit.  We apologize for any inconvenience. UPDATE, 4 NOV 04:  The files posted 3 Nov 04 for Attachment 2 (MESL) and  Attachment 3 (MESM)were incorrect as the titles had been erroneously  switched for the files.  These files have been deleted and the correct files have been reposted with a 4 Nov 04 date. UPDATE, 3 NOV 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP).  Please review the document in its entirety and submit comments and/or questions to the Contract Specialist cited therein no later than close of business 19 Nov  2004.  Comments may be submitted electronically.  If mailed, they must be  postmarked by close of business 19 Nov 2004. Please note that there has been one slight update to the Government  requirement.  In addition to the previously identified locations requiring COMBS Services support, the Government has updated the DRFP to now also include T-6 Modification Line or any other depot level repair location as part of the requirement.  The T-6 Modification Line is currently located at the Raytheon Aircraft Facility in Wichita, KS.  The requirement involves providing safety of flight parts support for aircraft on the mod line that have component failure unrelated to work performed at that location. UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become  mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/ bidders will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.   Contractors who already are registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) can get a head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca  to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond  what ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.

C.  BACKGROUND:  The IRS’ MITS Organization’s Enterprise Operations Services mission is to provide efficient, cost effective, secure and highly reliable computing (server and mainframe) services for all IRS business entities and taxpayers, and to manage the day-to-day operations of the network and contact center environments.  To accomplish parts of its mission, Enterprise Operations Services deploys and maintains an infrastructure capable of supporting the business and administrative needs of the Service for both the current environment and modernized operations; standardizes, consolidates and manages the mainframe computing infrastructure, and ancillary systems/software; maintains and modifies systems software products for the IRS mainframe-computing environment; implements appropriate security and mission assurance tools, processes, procedures, and infrastructure related to corporate computing services; provides services to business units/divisions within established Service Level Agreements (SLA); provides enterprise network operational support; and performs design, deployment, and maintenance of the contact center environment. 
 
D. DESIRED INFORMATION:  MITS is in the process of analyzing and reviewing its approach, practices, and procedures for performing Mainframe (Tier 1) Hardware Maintenance and Software Maintenance activities.  The Government is interested in finding out about new approaches, best practices or industry standards that could better meet its needs.  This RFI is intended to provide the Government with a better understanding of the methodologies, best practices, performance metrics, and service level agreements that would be available to them.  The effort contemplated will cover the acquisition of all software and hardware maintenance, technical support, project management support, warranties, and technology enhancements that include upgrades of all hardware and software at appropriate intervals with the best practices in technology.  The intent is to establish Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for a Mainframe Hardware Support Maintenance Contract (MHSMC) and a Mainframe Software Maintenance Contract (MSMC).  The Government anticipates that resulting delivery orders issued against the IDIQ contracts will be firm fixed price; some time and materials task orders are also anticipated.  The duration of the planned contracts if from FY05 to FY10.
In order to determine which contracts to set-aside for various small business classifications, interested contractors are requested to submit capability statements addressing their ability to perform the project requirements for IRS’ mainframe hardware and software described below.

<SOLNBR>W91QUZ-05-R-0001
<RESPDATE>111504
<ARCHDATE>03292005
<CONTACT>Teresa L. Lukavec, (703) 325-6172
<DESC>This notice is to give an update to the Army Knowledge Online Enterprise Services (AKO-ES) acquisition and provide instructions for due diligence. The following is the estimated schedule for the upcoming AKO-ES events: RFP Release:						approximately mid-November Commencement of Due Diligence period	1 week after RFP release or 29 Nov                                           2004 (whichever is later) Due Diligence Period			1 day per vendor DUE DILIGENCE It is well understood by the Army that the more competitors understand the Armys objectives, plans and operations, the more likely they are to submit superior solutions.  The due diligence process allows prospective offerors to gain a better understanding  of key organization mission objectives and existing conditions. 	a.  Phases of the Due Diligence Process.  The Due Diligence process will be conducted in two phases.  First, to provide access to information related to this acquisition, the establishment of a virtual reading room will occur not later than release of the  RFP.  	(1)  Virtual Reading Room. 		A virtual reading room will be established on the AKO web site for prospective offerors who desire to review documentation relevant to this solicitation.  All items posted in the virtual reading room are for Information Only and not considered part of the RFP. 		Offerors must include a request for a guest account on the AKO with their confirmation submittal (see paragraph (2) b.)  The Contracting Officer will forward account related information to the AKO sponsor who will activate the account.  Once accounts are  activated, the Contracting Officer will notify all offerors of their individual AKO e-mail address, a link to the AKO web site, and the path to the virtual library, as well as constraints while in the AKO portal.  All guest accounts will be deactivated on  that date of contract award.  Only one AKO guest account will be given per confirming prime offeror. 	(2)  One-on-One Sessions. 		a.  The one-on-one sessions will follow the principles identified by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.201, Exchanges with Industry before Receipt of Proposals.  A major objective of this session is to provide confirming offerors and their tea m members the ability to ask questions specific to their unique solutions that, by their very nature, they would not ask if the response were to be posted and provided to their competition.  As such, if the confirming offeror notifies the Government that t he questions it intends to ask during the one-on-one sessions are proprietary and whose release would identify confidential business strategies, or approaches, the questions and responses will be protected and held confidential. 		The confirming offeror teams will be given the opportunity to meet one-on-one with the team of Army representatives with knowledge of the current environments to better understand the Armys underlying mission and technical environment.  The purpose of t hese meetings is to allow confirming offerors a means to obtain and clarify information without disclosing proprietary or business confidential information to competitors. 	b.  Confirmation of Intent to Participate in Due Diligence.  Each offeror (i.e., prime contractor) intending to submit a proposal will confirm its participation in the AKO-ES acquisition via e-mail to the attention of Janet Spaulding, Contract Specialist at  AKO-ES@itec4.army.mil no later than 2:00 p.m., EST, 15 November 2004. The confirmation will include the following information to enable the Government to effectively coordinate the due diligence:  (1) the offerors due diligence point of contact (name, telephone number, and e-mail address); (2) a roster of attendees to inclu de company name and representative name (limited to 10); (3)  AKO guest account request to include the individuals full name that should receive the account access; (4) key areas of interest; (5) any additional inform ation the offeror deems necessary (e.g., handicap access requirements); and (6) interest in visiting the AKO Primary site (Note:  All attendees at the Primary Site must have a Secret Security Clearance).  Please submit evidence of such clearance with the  confirmation notice if interested in visiting the AKO Primary site.  Such evidence may be faxed to (703) 428-1685 if it is not possible to e-mail.  Please ensure that each page of the fax appropriately identifies the company name and the individuals name .  Timely submission of the confirmation is required to facilitate the establishment of session dates. 	The confirmed offeror teams due diligence point of contact will be notified by e-mail of the date, time, location, and other specifics of its one-on-one session.  Sessions will be selected by using a lottery process.  Notification of sessions will be pro vided at least three working days before the scheduled due diligence session.  Offerors are advised that employees of the incumbent AKO contractor, CherryRoad Technologies, Inc., and other support contractors perform functions at the AKO Primary site and, therefore, will be present during any site visits.   	c.  Request for Clarification (RFC).  All requests for RFP clarification will be accepted during the due diligence period.  RFCs shall be submitted to the ITEC4 Contracting Officer at AKO-ES@itec4.army.mil.  RFCs that result in specific information nece ssary to submit proposals will be provided to all confirming offerors via the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) web site as an amendment to the RFP.  Such information may also be posted to the virtual reading room so that confirming offerors have the inf ormation prior to a formal amendment being issued.  Therefore, questions/comments shall not include a restrictive legend and shall not include proprietary information.  No pre-proposal conference is planned.   	The Government will provide competing offerors equal access to data and information.  The Government assumes no responsibility for any representation made by any of its officers or agents during due diligence.  Offeror questions and Government responses f urnished during due diligence are considered to be unofficial.  PARTICIPATION OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS. 	a.  Offerors are advised that the commercial firms identified below will assist the Government in providing acquisition support during the due diligence.  These firms will be authorized access to the discussions conducted during the one-on-one sessions. These firms are expressly prohibited from competing on the subject acquisition. Firm:	       Acquisition Solutions, Inc. Address:      P.O. Box 3948, Oakton, VA  22124 POC:           Mr. Andy Sweet Telephone:  (703) 405-0676	 Facsimile:   (603) 307-8460 E-mail:  Andrew.Sweet@acquisitionsolutions.com Firm:          The MITRE Corporation Address:     7515 Colshire Drive, McLean, VA  22102 POC:  	       Mr. Max Rosen  Telephone: (703) 883-5703	 Facsimile:  (703) 883-6233 E-mail:       Max@Mitre.org 	b.  In accomplishing the duties related to the due diligence process, the aforementioned firms may have access to proprietary information discussed in the offerors one-on-one session.  Therefore, pursuant to FAR 9.505-4, these firms must execute an agree ment, with each offeror, that states that they will (1) protect the offerors information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it remains proprietary and (2) refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished.  To expedite the preparation for the due diligence process, it is requested that each offeror submit an agreement, via facsimile or e-mail, directly to the two firms for execution.  These agreements must be executed and submitted to the Contract ing Officer prior to the due diligence sessions.  NOTE:  Offerors who previously executed an agreement with Acquisition Solutions, Inc. or The MITRE Corporation under the Advisory Mult i-Step process, can resubmit the same agreement, if still deemed applicable.  Agreements may be sent via facsimile to (703) 428-1685 or via e-mail to Teresa.Lukavec@itec4.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>99--SEEKING COLLABORATION TO CONDUCT STUDENT COMPETITION TO NAME THE NODE 2 ELEMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS)
<SOLNBR>N-A
<RESPDATE>022805
<ARCHDATE>01262006
<CONTACT>Erika G Vick, NASA Education Flight Projects Office, Phone (202) 358-2209, Fax (202) 358-3032, Email evick@hq.nasa.gov
<DESC>Statement of Purpose NASA seeks an unfunded collaboration with a commercial or non-profit organization to define, organize and execute a nationwide project-oriented competition for K-12 students in U.S. schools to select a name for the Node 2 element of the International Space Station (ISS) to be launched on a future Space Shuttle flight. In some cases where there is significant private investment, provision of value-added public benefits and value to NASA, the Agency may contemplate limited exclusive offers, under certain conditions, such as official designation or association with NASA. This request for entrepreneurial offer outlines the minimum requirements for a project-oriented competition designed to inspire and motivate U.S. students to pursue studies and careers in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) as they apply similar principles to a project that may result in the official name for the ISS Node 2 element.  NASA is interested in receiving from U.S. companies, academic institutions, or non-profit organizations creative recommendations to accomplish these minimums and any additional ideas that may increase public involvement in NASA's human space flight programs.	It is intended that this request for entrepreneurial offer will result in the establishment of a non-reimbursable Space Act Agreement by June 15, 2005 that will define the full roles and responsibilities of NASA and the proposing organization.  For information on Space Act Agreements, please see    http://www.hq.nasa.gov/ogc/samanual.html   .    Mission Background  NASA is embarking on a new and exciting chapter in space exploration. The new vision for U.S. space exploration calls for a sustained, achievable, and affordable human and robotic program to explore the solar system and beyond. The International Space Station (ISS) has played and will now play an even more crucial role in paving the way for human space exploration beyond low Earth orbit. The President directed NASA to complete assembly of the ISS by the end of this decade and to focus U.S. research and use of the ISS on supporting space exploration goals, with emphasis on understanding how the space environment affects astronaut health and developing countermeasures and spacecraft systems, such as those for life support. NASA’s Node 2 is the next pressurized module to be installed on the Space Station.  The arrival of the Node marks the completion of the core U.S. portion of the ISS and, as the connecting point for several of the International Partner elements, will set in motion the final steps toward completing the assembly of the ISS.  When installed on the U.S. Laboratory Destiny, Node 2 will increase the living and working space inside the Space Station to approximately 18,000 cubic feet.   Attaching Node 2 to Destiny will allow several key science facilities to be attached to the International Space Station, including the Japanese Experiment Module name “Kibo,” or Hope – the research laboratory developed by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA); the Columbus Module – a general purpose science lab designed by the European Space Agency; and the Centrifuge Accommodation Module – a U.S. laboratory dedicated to gravitational biology research. The Node 2 will accommodate the H2 Transfer Vehicle – a Japanese carrier similar to the Russian Progress supply ship, which takes supplies to and from the Space Station.  A pressurized mating adapter attached to the Node 2 will become the Space Shuttle’s primary docking location on the International Space Station.  Multipurpose Logistics Modules that carry cargo and experiment racks to and from the Station will also use specific docking ports on the Node 2. Alenia Spazio, an international contractor based in Rome, Italy designed and built the Node 2 at its facility in Torino, Italy, as part of an agreement between NASA and the European Space Agency.	The Node 2 project is managed by NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, AL.  In May 2003, the Node 2 was shipped to the Kennedy Space Center, FL, from where it will be launched on the Space Shuttle to the International Space Station. Project Background: "Name the Node 2" Competition  Names for NASA missions, spacecraft, landers, and rovers ultimately will be selected by the responsible mission directorate managers at NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C. Submissions of candidate names, however, may be gathered through a variety of methods, including competitions that invite participation by K-12 students. By focusing the International Space Station (ISS) "Name the Node 2" competition on K-12 entries, NASA seeks to engage U.S. students in the engineering and scientific enterprise behind human space flight programs in furtherance of national goals to stimulate interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education in preparation for careers in these fields. NASA views such competitions as opportunities that further the Agency objectives to “inspire the next generation of explorers”, involve the public, and distribute knowledge gained from the space program to a broad audience. To support these objectives, NASA has determined that all suggestions for potential names for the Node 2 will be gathered through a "Name the Node 2" project-oriented competition with broad K-12 student participation.  Because such competitions draw considerable public interest, the process of registering, sorting, evaluating and judging entries is labor-intensive and requires careful consideration of entries and feedback to entrants. At the same time, such competitions present excellent opportunities to engage the interest of young Americans in space science and exploration, its objectives, and the advances it produces in science, math, engineering and technology and knowledge in general.  Scope  This request will be open through six weeks following date of release of this announcement. All proposals must be received by February 28, 2005 to be considered. The successful proposer will agree to conduct a competition during the Fall 2005 semester to evaluate, select and deliver to the Office of the Chief Education Officer at NASA Headquarters by February 28, 2006, the top 25 names that have been proposed and the associated nomination projects submitted by the students. A panel of NASA representatives from the Office of the Chief Education Officer and the Office of Space Operations, at a minimum, will recommend a subset of 10 names to senior NASA management by April 28, 2006. NASA Headquarters will make the final selection by May 31, 2006. Benefits to a Corporate Partner  In exchange for the creation and facilitation of the naming competition, NASA may consider negotiating limited exclusivity and other opportunities as part of a strategic collaboration. Consideration may be made for those offers that are commensurate in value, and reflect NASA mission, values and goals.  The selected proposer would have an opportunity to be part of a historic mission, one that helps NASA reach its mission and outreach goals. Secondly, the selected proposer would have the appropriate level of acknowledgement as a partner with NASA, commensurate with the proposer's added value return to the Agency.  NASA projects attract extraordinary public awareness and interest on an international level. During the course of the Mars Exploration Rovers project there was extensive coverage through virtually all media outlets, over one billion hits were observed on project Web sites, and the project received extensive attention in multiple public forums including academic, Congressional and industry communities.  Deliverables include, but are not limited to:  -  Monthly status reports on competition plans and progress from July 2005 through the launch of Node 2 no earlier than December 2006 containing, for example, :        o The number of schools, education organizations and students reached directly and indirectly through promotion strategies;        o Number of respondents from each school/city/state at each grade level;        o Post-selection plan for making any awards or prizes.  -  A contest summary report due February 28, 2006 that includes:        o The top 25 nominations and rationale for their selection;        o Final data on competition participation;        o Advertising and/or educational programs associated with the winners or winning submissions.        o Lessons learned. -  The competition organizer will preserve relevant data on the numbers of entries received, the most commonly suggested names, the most unique names, and the locations in the U.S. or its territories from which entries are received. All submitted student projects become the property of NASA.  -  Weekly status teleconference  Terms of Agreement  The Space Act Agreement will be in effect from the time of selection through completion of proposed activities, or no later than the launch of Node 2. There are no options for renewal.  Instructions for Proposal Preparation  Proposals will be judged on their educational value and the expected breadth and depth of penetration into the national K-12 student population via the mass media and traditional channels into the classroom. Proposers are strongly encouraged to develop the plan in cooperation with a nationally recognized education association or similar professional educator network of the proposer's choosing. A key goal of this effort is to inspire American youth in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics learning; creative collaborations between commercial and non-profit educational organizations in furtherance of this objective are encouraged. The successful proposal will include:  -  A plan to launch and manage a project-oriented competition inviting K-12 students nationwide to submit, at no charge, names and associated projects for the Node 2 element of the International Space Station (ISS). Student projects will explain the nomination. Submissions from students will be invited in the Fall 2005 semester, and will be accepted through December 16, 2005. Both electronic mail and paper mail delivery (including submission by compact disc) will be accepted as means of submission. Proposals must include the process for handling electronic submissions.  -  A description of roles and responsibilities of competition coordinators, and the management structure of the implementation team.  -  A description of how the competition will be conducted, including how entries from widely varying age groups will be judged based on grade-appropriate evaluations. In addition, it should include how the competition will be widely advertised, how it will be evaluated and by whom, qualifications of competition judges, how duplicate entries (same name proposed by multiple entrants) will be judged, and what recognition, benefits and/or prizes all entrants shall receive. The proposer also must describe how personal information, submitted by the essay authors, will be protected (most, if not all, of the authors will be minors) and any proposed, additional use of that information.  -  A schedule of key events in the process aligned with the schedule provided with this solicitation.  -  Description of the educational plan for the competition and how it will reinforce and sustain student learning.  -  Description of additional activities to increase public involvement in NASA’s human space flight programs.  Threshold Requirements  All proposals must comply with the following to be considered:  -  Demonstrable ability to design, conduct, manage, and finance this competition under the parameters described.   -  Organization and its proposal are consistent with NASA mission, objectives and values. -  No requirement of personal endorsement or personnel participation in advertising or marketing by NASA officials or employees.  -  Compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1972, the Child Online Privacy Protection Act, and any other applicable Federal laws.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), NIH has a need to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and compatibility with diptheria, tetanus toxoid and pertussis vaccine (DTP) of an investigational Vi-rEPA conjugate vaccine for typhoid fever when administered to infants in Vietnam.  Three groups of infants, composed of 100 healthy full-term newborns each, are planned for this study.  The infants will be recruited from mothers of 15 communes in Thanh Thuy District, Phu Tho Province, Vietnam.  The NICHD plans to award a contract to National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE) in Hanoi, using other than full and open competition.  NICHD has completed studies of Vi conjugate vaccine for typhoid fever in adults, 5 to 14 year olds and 2 to 4 year olds in 1997 and 1999.  However, the evaluation of immunogenicity and safety in infants were not completed as yet.  Accordingly, NICHD has a neeed to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and comparability of Vi-rEPA, injected concurrently with DTP in infants using the Expanded Program on Immunization schedule.  The planned study is a continuation of the first two studies of safety and immunogenicity in older children and adults, and a phase 3 clinical efficacy trial in 2-4 years old children.  The study in infants is an obligatory step to incorporate Vi-rEPA vaccine into the infant immunization program.  The Vietnamese investigators have conducted all phases of vaccine evaluations and they have the necessary expertise and infrastructure to conduct this study.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there are other sources with the same capabilities to perform the work described above.  Capability statements should be sybmitted within 45 days of the publication of this synopsis to Ms. Mya Nwe Hlaing, Contracting Officer, CMB, NICHD, NIH, 61000 Executive Blvd., Suite 7A-07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, MD 20892-7510.

While it is imperative that coatings provide a measure of improved resistance to soiling, coatings that additionally provide any combination or all of the following benefits are desired:  improved ink adhesion, enhanced print quality, reduction of ink set-off, and improvement in physical properties of the notes such as improved folding endurance and tear strength. Officials from the Department of Treasury and/or Federal Reserve Bank may also be consulted regarding technologies and materials submitted under this announcement. With the written permission of the submitter, the Bureau may also consult with experts under government contracts for their evaluation.

For initial screening purposes, interested parties are requested to submit preliminary samples, a brief technical description of the technology, process and materials submitted.  Additional, interested parties shall submit price estimates in the event the Bureau desires to procure larger quantities for testing purposes.  All information shall be submitted to Larry McCain, Bureau of Engraving & Printing, Office of Procurement, 14th & C Streets, SW, Washington, DC 20228.  Previously submitted materials or technologies need not resubmit.  If you have any questions, please contact Larry McCain, telephone number:  (202) 874-0133 or by e-mail:  larry.mccain@bep.treas.gov.  Interested parties who submit materials and or technologies shall be aware that the Bureau will respond to the submitter and advise whether or not the Bureau requires additional information or if the Bureau is unable to utilize the technology or material submitted.

Breakfast and lunch may be either hot or cold meals, but dinner must be a hot meal. Meals must be well balanced, nutritious, palatable and varied. If special dietary needs (e.g., low sodium, vegetarian, diabetic, etc.) are required, USGS will notify the contractor at least 10 days prior to scheduled departure of the nature and number of special dietary requirements.
