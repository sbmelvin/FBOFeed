<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 333314 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. <br /><br />The Government requires a purchase of one (1) narrow linewidth Ti:Sapphire laser with external cavity doubler with integrated low noise diode pumped solid state laser pump source (SolsTiS). The system consists of:
<p>SolsTiS 5000 PSX R: Narrow linewidth Ti:Sa laser, ICE-BLOC system control electronics, chiller, pump integration kit (PIK) and Verdi V18 pump source.<br /><br />Specifications:<br />&bull; Power at 738 nm &gt; 4.7 W<br />&bull; Tuning range 725 - 875 nm<br />&bull; Linewidth &lt; 100 kHz measured over 100 us<br />&bull; Amplitude noise &lt; 0.075 % RMS (10 Hz to 10 MHz)<br />&bull; PSX model allows for high resolution resonator scans over &gt; 25 GHz at 780 nm</p>
<p>ECD-X Enhancement Cavity: ECD-X SHG enhancement cavity operates from 363 - 437nm. The system will include one crystal module providing tuning of up to +/- 10nm and centered at 369nm. <br /><br />ECD-X specifications:<br />&bull; Power output at 369 nm &gt; 1.5 W<br />&bull; Scan range &gt; 40 GHz<br />&bull; Linewidth &lt; 200 kHz measured over 100 &mu;s<br />&bull; Amplitude noise &lt; 0.15% RMS (10 Hz to 10 MHz)<br />&bull; M^2 &lt; 1.2 (typical &lt; 1.1)</p>
<p>Terascan (TS): Advanced functionality for automated, continuous, mode-hop-free, high resolution wavelength scans over 10 nm<br />&bull; Incorporates a Fixed Infra-Red Pick Off and Fiber Launch Module for stable connection to customer's wavemeter</p>
<p>Variable Infra-Red Pick-Off + Low Power Fiber Launch Module: <br />&bull; Integrated variable infra-red pick-off module for stable, safe access to SolsTiS output (~5% to 95%)<br />&bull; Low Power Fiber Launch Module</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with:</p>
<p>M Squared Lasers INC<br />1 Broadway FL. 14<br />Cambridge MA 02142-1187</p>
<p>The Government has determined that no other source can meet this requirement. It is essential to have a system that offers highest specification and flexibility and offers automated, hands free operation over the wavelength region required in the Government's experiments. Also required is the ECDx frequency doubling module which is the most efficient SHG enhancement cavity available and covers 363 - 437nm with a single set of optics. The SolsTiS also offers the feature of a hermetically sealed cavity and fully hands-free, automated operation with no manual adjustment, which can complete a 5nm mode hop free, continuous scan with kHz resolution within 10 minutes. Other manufactures are unable to meet this requirement without severely impacting or jeopardizing the success of ongoing research which would result in a loss of efficiency and the ability to experiment will be impaired</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to matthew.zawisza@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>
<p>Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 22 February 2019.</p>
<p>A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award.</p>

The BOA RFP will result in the execution of BOAs with offerors determined to be technically acceptable in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation. Separate TO RFPs (Step 3) will also be issued for each of the EAGLE requirements emerging within the year; however, the BOA RFP will be the only opportunity contractors will have to obtain an executed EAGLE BOA in order to propose against the subsequent TO RFPs.

Contractors are advised to periodically review FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov) in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued; failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the closing date and time of the BOA RFP may render the proposal nonresponsive and result in its rejection.

For those such Task Orders, the offerors (and subcontractors performing applicable tasks) will be required to possess the SECRET Facility Clearance at the time of the RFP closing date, at the time of award, and throughout the life of the contract. The offeror (i.e. the legal entity that is submitting the proposal and would be identified as the awardee of the contract) will be required to possess the SECRET Facility Clearance itself and will not be able to rely solely on the clearance of a subcontractor; for a proposal submitted by a Joint Venture, the SECRET Facility Clearance must be granted under the name and CAGE code of the Joint Venture itself for it to be eligible for award, regardless of whether the managing partner or all members of the Joint Venture have a SECRET Facility Clearance. Possession of an INTERIM SECRET Facility Clearance at the time of RFP closing date may be sufficient to meet the requirement for some Task Orders, provided that it can be validated by the Defense Security Service (DSS); however, if access to classified COMSEC information will be necessary for the performance of a Task Order, FINAL US Government Clearance at the appropriate level will be necessary to perform upon award. Possession of a BOA will not alleviate the need for the SECRET Facility Clearance, therefore, offerors who plan on competing for the task order solicitations that require a SECRET Facility Clearance will need to obtain the SECRET Facility Clearance via sponsorship from another contractor who already possesses a SECRET Facility Clearance. Eligibility information and requirements can be found at www.dss.mil. A Defense Security Service pamphlet is also provided on the EAGLE website for additional guidance on how to obtain a clearance.</p>
<p>To be eligible for award, offerors must be registered in the System For Award Management at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/sam/.</p>

Past Performance Confidence Assessment<br />A Production Demonstration Model (PDM) will be required to accompany each proposal. Two (2) coveralls shall be submitted.<br />3. Small Business Support<br />It is anticipated this solicitation will be posted to the DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) on or after February 2019. All offerors MUST be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). All responsible sources may submit offers which, if received in timely fashion, shall be considered.<br />DLA Troop Support has developed a web-based system that allows manufacturers the ability to request specifications, patterns and drawings on our contracting page. To request technical data for DLA Troop Support Clothing and Textiles solicitations, use the following link to the DLA Troop Support C&amp;T Technical Data Repository area at http://www.troopsupport.dla.mil/Portal/sreqfrm.aspx. <br />Important Note on Foreign Content: <br />The Defense appropriations and authorization acts and other statutes (including what is commonly referred to as "The Berry Amendment" impose restrictions on the DoD's acquisition of foreign products and services. Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and "specialty metals" (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7014) must be grown, reprocessed, reused, melted or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.<br />-------- IMPORTANT NOTICE: NEW REQUIREMENT --------<br />Due to a DOD regulation requiring "identity certificates" when accessing DOD computer systems, VIM-ASAP (https://vim.dla.mil) will soon become Common Access Card (CAC) enabled. This means in order to access the system a company representative must have an ECA Certificate. There is a cost involved in obtaining a certificate (approximately $125.00 to $150.00 per year per certificate). VIM is scheduled to begin using the new logon from 8/23/2013 through 9/30/2103. After that date, no one may log on using the old user ID and password.<br />DoDI 8520.2 Mandates the use of DoD PKI identity certificates when accessing DoD information systems. The DoD established the External Certification Authority (ECA) program to support the issuance of DoD- approved certificates to industry partners and other external entities and organizations. ECA certificates enable contractors to securely communicate with the DoD and authenticate themselves to DoD Information Systems. ECA Certificates are individually issued digital identity credentials. The DoD relies upon these credentials to ensure the identity of the user in online environments or when a certificate holder tries accessing DoD Information Systems.<br />The following are the three entities authorized by the DoD to issue ECA Certificates. Review and apply for an ECA Certificate from one of the below organizations to access your VIM account:<br />1. IdenTrust: http://www.identrust.com/certificates/eca/index.html<br />2. ORC (Operational Research Consultants): http://eca.orc.com/<br />3. VeriSign: https://eca.verisign.com/<br />There are three types of certificates: Medium Assurance, Medium Token Assurance, Medium Hardware Assurance. If one person always signs in from the same computer they can get the Medium Assurance which gets loaded to their hard drive. If one person logs on from different computers they should get the Medium Token Assurance which can be carried around like a thumb drive. Only one person can use an ECA certificate. Each user will need their own (like our CAC card). Each person who needs to access the system will need one.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Availability of solicitations: FAR 5.102(d) applies, as our office no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form. <br />Interested offerors can obtain a copy of the solicitation after the issuance date at: https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. Detailed system requirements and instructions for registration can be found on the DLA DIBBS home page accessed on https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. A few highlights of the information that will be found include: 1. On the DLA Internet Bulletin Board System (DIBBS) home page, click the VENDOR REGISTRATION link to begin the registration process. 2.

<CONTACT>Schroeder, Gregory
<DESC>The Department of Interior (DOI), Interior Business Center (IBC), Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD), Herndon, VA in support of Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Program Executive Office (PEO) for Integrated Warfare Systems (IWS), intends to issue full and open Request for Proposal (RFP) 140D7019R0007 for the procurement of commercial aviation support services using Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items and Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation. The Government intends to award a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, with the issuance of Firm-Fixed-Unit-Price (FFUP) task orders. The period of performance is up to five (5) years and consists of a 12 month base period and four (4), 12 month options under NAICS 481219 - Other Nonscheduled Air Transportation.

NAVSEA PEO IWS has a need for contractor-operated and contractor -maintained jet aircraft and flight services to support the Test and Evaluation (T&E) of the AEGIS Combat System and other integrated Electronic Warfare (EW) systems currently aboard US Navy ships, as well as other land-based systems. AEGIS is an integrated naval combat system that uses powerful computer and radar technology to track and guide weapon systems to destroy enemy targets. The contractor provided personnel and aircraft (outfitted with government furnished equipment/property) will fly predetermined testing scenarios around US Navy ships and/or land-based systems, so that radar and other warfare system instrumentation can be tested and calibrated. These scenarios will also act as training for the ship¿s crew. These testing events involve the coordination of many military assets (i.e. ships, submarines, aircraft, drones, military personnel, and other support contractors), which equate to millions of dollars per day to conduct. 

Aircraft will be required for the simulation of EW systems utilized by hostile aircraft. There will be four primary aircraft that shall be designated as Exclusive Use (EU) and will be utilized for an estimated 200 days within first twelve-month period of performance and potentially up to an estimated 800-1,250 combined flight hours (across all EU aircraft) in addition to the guaranteed EU availability. The contractor will occasionally be required to provide up to two On-Call (OC)/ Call-When -Needed (CWN) aircraft as well, that may be utilized for up to an estimated 200 combined flight hours. With the OC/CWN aircraft, the Contractor could have six (6) aircraft performing under a single task order at any given time (4 EU and 2 OC).  

In addition, aircraft shall meet the minimum aircraft requirements such as performance, payload, power plant(s), seating, speed/endurance, crew requirements outlined in the solicit action. While it's assumed that the contractor will purchase the majority of its fuel at military airfields, only fuels meeting the specifications of American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM) D-1655 (Jet A, A-1, or B), Mil T-5624 (JP-4, JP-8, JP-5) shall be used.

The contractor will be required to hold and keep current multiple aviation certificates required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOI Office of Aviation Services (OAS), Air Mobility Command (AMC), and Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR); to include but not limited to: Supplemental Type Certificate (STC), Interim Flight Clearances (IFC), Airworthiness Certificates (multiple), Air Carrier or Operating Certificate, and various pilot certifications. While various commercial jet aircraft have the performance requirements however Learjet models 35 and 36 are currently the only models of Learjet with the required STCs that meet the Navy's combat systems test needs for the attachment, carriage, and installation of the Navy's T&E Government Furnished Property (GFP). NAVAIR will be responsible under the Navy's Airworthiness Program to issue associated Interim Flight Clearances (IFC) in order for the GFP to be operated on the contracted commercial jet aircraft. The IFC process requires NAVAIR personnel to conduct extensive inspection of a vendor's facilities and review pertinent FAA airworthiness certificates and applicable STCs. The modifications and certification of aircraft that meet the Navy¿s vary however can be lengthy and a high dollar investment. 

The primary locations where services are to be performed will be in California and Virginia; however, aircraft may be required to fly to various locations throughout the United States, its territories, and other countries, as needed.

In addition, the contractor will be required to obtain security clearances for all facilities used, as well as crewmembers and support personnel engaged in operations under the resulting contract, as specified in DD Form 254 - Department of Defense (DOD) Contract Security Classification Specifications.

This pre-solicitation synopsis is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, RFP, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. 

The Government will consider all comments received on this pre-solicitation synopsis.  The Government does not commit to providing a response to any comment or question.

<DESC>EXWC requires an automated inspection tool that performs rapid and complete 3D surface measurements and mapping of hand-held sized materials and components.  EXWC currently does not have an automated 3D measurement tool.  Current inspections of small project parts or specimens are done using manual or digital calipers for width, length, and height, or with an archaic stylus-type profilometer for surface profile and roughness information.  These methods are slow and inadequate for critical failure inspections and similar analyses, in comparison to newer scanning technology. 
Measurement Specifications Required:
-Non-contact (measuring head does NOT need to touch the sample)
-2 Viewing Modes:  Wide-Field and High Magnification for up to 180X magnification
-Field-of-View:  Up to 24-mm Horizontal and 18-mm Vertical
-Zoom Range:  Up to 4X
-Measurement Accuracy:   ±3-um height and ±2-um width (high magnification mode)
-Measurement Repeatability:  0.5-um height and 0.5-um (high magnification mode)
-Scale Resolution:  Down to 0.1-um
-Data Points per Measurement:  Up to 780,000 
-Speed:  Down to 4-seconds per single scan per view area
-Height Difference Calculation Method:  Triangulation
-Measurement Lighting:  White LED
Types of Measurements Required:
-Height 
-Surface Area, Roughness, Wear,  and  Warp
-Volume 
-Angles
-Line to Line Distance
-Point to Point Distance
-Center to Center Distance
-Circle Diameter
-Arc Radius
-Corner Radius
3D Color Imaging Required:
-Imaging Size: Up to 2048 x 1500-Pixels
-CMOS Imaging Resolution:  9+ MP (megapixels)
-16-bit High Dynamic Resolution
-Telecentric lenses to minimize distortion in the field of view
-Observation Lighting:  Multi-Color LED
-Built-in Depth Composition
Sample Stage Required:
-200 x 150-mm minimum surface size
-Motorized stroke:  minimum 180 x 80-mm (X, Y-axes) and 90-mm (Z-axis) movement
-Rotation:   ±180-degrees minimum
-Tilt:  ±30-degrees minimum
-Minimum Distance of Head to Stage:  75-mm

Bench-top Sized (entire system)

<CONTACT>Christopher Franz, Procurement Specialist, Phone 509-376-8050, Email christopher_j_franz@rl.gov
<DESC>Washington River Protection Solutions (WRPS) is seeking prospective contractors who are interested in and capable of providing commercial services consisting of transportation, treatment, and possibly disposal of the secondary process waste generated at the Effluent Treatment Facility (ETF) located in the 200 Area at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site in southeastern Washington State. The secondary process waste ETF produces can be generated as either a liquid, as a concentrated brine, or a solid, in a powder form. It would be preferable if prospective vendors could receive the waste as<br />both brine and powder. However, if prospective vendors provide an explanation why it would be necessary for them to receive the material in only a concentrated brine or solid powder form or if there is some overriding benefit in doing so, then WRPS may consider producing the secondary waste as only a powder or brine waste form.

<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUEST FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the Defense Logistics Agency to identify potential manufacturing/supply sources, and if future efforts can be competitive or Set Aside for Small Business. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 332721 which has a corresponding Size Standard of 500 employees. This SSS is to notify companies that the Defense Logistics Agency, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, is seeking qualified sources for the acquisition of a Fixture Aircraft; NSN: 4920-01-192-1058, Part Number: 70700-20480-041 in support of the UH- 60 Blackhawk weapon system.

STATEMENT OF WORK
 VISN 9 Endoscopy Reporting"
Scope
The Contractor shall deliver to the Government a commercially available, off the shelf software (COTS), enterprise-wide (to encompass all VISN 9) gastrointestinal endoscopy system comprised of software and related hardware (System) that will produce GI endoscopy clinical procedure documentation. This system will also include endoscopy image management (i.e. capture and storage of still and video images from the endoscopic equipment, as well as a system for labeling these images). In addition, the system will generate procedure codes (i.e. CPT) and diagnostic codes (i.e. ICD-10) based upon data input by the clinician. This system should streamline workflows by giving the ability to capture, store and access patient data across multiple sites for Endoscopic procedures. The system should have the capability to provide a data repository for storage and maintenance of Endoscopy quality measures to document and improve performance. The technology stores clinician procedure notes as structured data and uses the structured data to organize and generate documentation directed to specific audiences. The technology provides medical content for Gastroenterology. Inclusion of nursing notes, including pre-procedure assessment, intraprocedural documentation (e.g. medication administration) and post-procedure recovery may be considered as an optional add-on. This system must have the appropriate VA approvals to integrate with the current VA electronic health record such that the procedure report and endoscopic images are incorporated into the patient s health record.

VISN 9 requires a GI clinical procedure documentation and coding system for 3 physical locations and 23 procedure rooms and emergency carts.  The locations and number of workstations are listed in Table 1.

<DESC>FBO SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
<p>1. Solicitation Number: 75N95019R00029</p>
<p>2. Title: NINDS Human Genetics Resource Center</p>
<p>3. Classification Code: A - Research &amp; Development</p>
<p>4. NAICS Code: 541715 -Research and Development in the Physical,<br />Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology)</p>
<p>5. Description: This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background: The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) has the stated mission to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. To support and accelerate the discovery of genetic causes and risk factors for neurological disorders, particularly complex diseases with multiple phenotypes, NINDS conducts and funds longitudinal clinical research studies and trials. These studies have generated a collection of biological materials with associated de-identified phenotypic and clinical data from individuals affected by neurological disorders and from neurologically normal control individuals. The NINDS Human Genetics Center, also known as the NINDS DNA and Cell Line Repository ("the NINDS repository") currently houses this collection of DNA samples, lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), and accompanying genotypic, phenotypic, clinical and pedigree data. Established in 2002, the NINDS repository contains DNA samples and LCL from more than fifty-one thousand well-phenotyped unique individuals. As an invaluable shared resource for the scientific community, the NINDS repository receives, stores and distributes well characterized, high-quality human cell lines and DNA for use in biomedical research. It ensures that contributions from research participants are maximally utilized and decreases duplicative sampling efforts. It also ensures that a standardized, useful dataset of demographic, other phenotypic, and genotypic data is managed and curated to allow sharing publicly via related resources, such as the NIH Database of Genotype and Phenotype (dbGaP).</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: This contract re-competition builds upon this existing infrastructure of the NINDS repository and provides a state-of-the-art inventory system for the storage and distribution of the existing collection. The contract also receives, processes, stores, and catalogues biological samples from ongoing collections of the NINDS-approved studies to facilitate the goals and specific scientific aims of NINDS grantees and other scientists studying neurological disorders.</p>
<p>The objective of this requirement is to continue services without interruption, including the growth of the sample numbers in some disease areas, the maintenance and curation of samples and data in the existing collection and the distribution of samples and data to qualified investigators at academic, non-profit, and for-profit institutions throughout the United States and abroad.</p>
<p>To be deemed capable, a small business must have a demonstrated track record of running a large established biobank; recognized expertise in human genetics and genomics, bioinformatics, cell culture, and molecular biology; and experience in managing a complex resource, including customer service and outreach. Specifically, a small business must demonstrate the ability and related experience in a requirement-specific Capability Statement to: 1) Receive and process whole blood samples collected from affected subjects, their relatives, and controls for DNA extraction and lymphocyte isolation; 2) Manage and track administrative study documents, phenotypic and genotypic data; 3) Monitor human subject concerns compliance with federal and other human subject regulations, including a means of masking individual identities to ensure confidentiality; 4) Maintain flexibility to expand operations as needed to accomplish aims of related projects; 5) Provide rapidly, upon request, as well as routinely, cell lines and DNA samples as well as associated data to submitters and sample withdrawers; 6) Transfer the entire existing NINDS repository of DNA, cell lines and data to their organization in a manner that allows seamless access to the existing collection; 7) Provide adequate cold storage facilities and equipment for securing, processing, storing, tracking, cataloging, and distributing the existing collection of samples from over 50 thousand individuals plus additional samples from 5 thousand individuals and associated complex phenotypic and genotypic data; 8) Develop a website, transfer the existing web-based system, and maintain and modify the website based on needs of the resource; 9) Develop, transfer, and maintain a database of all associated data and resources needed to manage the NINDS repository and associated user interface; and 10) Create informatics and data management solutions to allow easy usability of the collection and utilize informatics solutions to dovetail and federate with databases and data management tools used by related projects. NINDS collection of approximately two million sample tubes and the associated clinical data would need to be moved from the current facility in Camden, NJ to the new facility.</p>
<p>Capability statement /information sought: Respondents must provide clear and convincing documentation of their capability of providing the goods and/or services specified in this notice. Also, information must be provided in sufficient details of the respondents' (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and other management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information.</p>

<p>Finally, respondents are also encouraged to provide a general overview of the respondent's opinions about the difficulty and/or feasibility of the potential requirement, and any other information regarding innovative ideas or concepts that may be applicable.</p>
<p>Submission Instructions: The information submitted must be in an outline format that addresses each of the elements of the project requirement and in the capability statement /information sought paragraphs stated herein. A cover page and an executive summary may be included but is not required.</p>
<p>The response is limited to ten (10) page limit. The 10-page limit does not include the cover page, executive summary, or references, if requested.</p>

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought for information and planning purposes.  Naval Supply Center (NAVSUP) Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk’s intent of this announcement is to identify qualified and experienced sources for a contract vehicle that will provide Dive Training Services for Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) as defined in the attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS). This announcement constitutes a sources sought for written information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and a contract will not be awarded from of this announcement. This announcement is not to be construed in any way as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.

Anticipated NAICS Code
The NAICS Code for this requirement is 713990– All Other Amusement and Recreation Industries and the Size Standard is $7.5 MILLION.
The Government has not yet determined whether an existing strategically sourced vehicle will be used to satisfy this requirement. If it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to utilize Seaport-E, then the applicable NAICS code and size standard will be 541330 – Engineering Services and $38.5 million. Respondents should provide their business size in both potential NAICS. 

Reponses to this Sources Sought request should reference N0018919Q0093 and shall include the following information in this format: 

1. Company name, address, point of contact name, phone number, fax number and email address. 

2. Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Code.

3. If the services can be solicited from a GSA schedule, provide the GSA contract number.

4.
If the services can be solicited from Global Business Support (GBS), please provide the contract number.

5. If the services can be solicited from SeaPort-e, please provide the contract number.

6. Size of business - Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantage, 8(a), Hubzone, Woman-owned and/or Service Disabled Veteran-owned.

7. An estimated Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM).

8. A copy of SAM.GOV active registration. Must reflect Data Universal Numbering System, Commercial and Government Entity, and Reps/Certs.

9. Capability statement displaying the contractor’s ability to provide the services, to include past performance information. If past performance information is provided, please include only relevant past performance on the same/similar work within the last 5 years.
 Please also include in past performance information the contract numbers, dollar value, and period of performance for each contract referenced in the response to this sources sought.

10. The Government is still determining the acquisition strategy and if this acquisition will be a small business set-aside, then FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, applies. Note that if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability among small businesses, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a small business set-aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR clause 52.219-14.

If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, and if subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of the effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large business subcontractors will be used.
Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.

11. Include any other supporting documentation.

12. Comments or suggested changes to the Governments NAICS Determination
 
13. Identify conditions or issues the U.S. Government should consider or may interfere with the intention of this project.

Documentation of technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition. Standard company brochures will not be reviewed. Submissions are not to exceed ten (10) typewritten pages in no less than 12 font size.


Responses shall be emailed to Lisa Morton at Lisa.Morton@navy.mil by 10AM EST on Wednesday, January 30, 2018.  Again, this is not a Request for Proposal.  Respondents will not be notified of the results.

<p>Anticipated solicitation: W9128F19R0031 <br />*contingent on availability of funding</p>
<p>**LARGE BUSINESSES DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE**<br />Purpose: By way of this Market Survey/Sources Sought Notice, the USACE-Omaha District intends to determine the extent of capable firms that are engaged in providing the services described hereunder. The responses to this notice will be used for planning purposes for upcoming procurements. Therefore, this notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Quotation or Bid; it does not guarantee the future issue of a RFP/IFB; nor does it commit the government to contract for any supply or service.</p>
<p>Further, this Agency will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that this Agency will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this Notice; all costs associated with responding to this Notice will be solely at the responding party's expense. At this time, proprietary information is not being requested, and respondents shall refrain from providing proprietary information in response to this Sources Sought Notice.</p>
<p>Intent: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Omaha District, intends to pursue award of a construction contract to: install a multi-stage granular filter and drain around and beneath existing 48" to 60" conduits; remove approximately 50 linear feet of existing RCP-lined, CMP conduit and replace with a new section of steel pipe and air shaft; place a compacted, random fill stability berm; place riprap protection at the outlet of the drainage layer and conduit; and other appurtenant work for grading requirements at the downstream end of 4 (four) high hazard dams in the vicinity of Lincoln, Nebraska.</p>
<p>Work anticipated under this requirement includes, but is not limited to, Conduit removal and replacement will only occur at 3 (three) of the dams. It will be necessary to perform the work at each site in sequenced phases in order to mitigate against the potential for dam-safety related issues. Filter installation will require a relatively deep and narrow excavation utilizing specialized techniques and temporary structural measures that will minimize the unsupported length of pipe and/or directly provide for its temporary support. Excavations will extend into groundwater and significant consideration should be given to minimizing subgrade disturbance and managing groundwater. It is anticipated that a significant dewatering effort utilizing a system of wellpoints and associated pumping equipment will be required for at least one of the dam sites. The anticipated wellpoint system should be capable of covering a minimum length of 150 lineal feet, and dewatering materials that are 5 to 10 feet thick, have a transmissivity of up to 240 ft/day, and a hydraulic conductivity with specific yield of up to 0.01. The Contractor will be required to develop and submit for approval excavation plans that details their proposed excavation process and all supported designs for temporary structural measures and dewatering systems. The Contractor will also be required to develop detailed drill plans, surveillance and contingency plans that outline critical procedures and appropriate responding actions that would be undertaken if adverse conditions develop.</p>

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:

INTRODUCTION: 
In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3,  Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes  This Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only at this time and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) is conducting a market survey and is seeking potential sources for the Parking Garage Expansion at the Phoenix Veterans Administration Health Care System. This is a DESIGN-BUILD project.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The purpose of this project is to improve veteran s experience at the Phoenix Veterans Administration Health Care System by increasing 400 parking spaces to the current available on-site parking. Feasibility efforts have determined the optimal option to achieve this goal is to expand the existing PVAMC parking garage and improve the overall efficiency of the combined structure. The existing structure was designed for future expansion, where mandrel connections can be placed on the west and north faces. 

Due to space constraints, it has also been determined that the north end expansion be built over a future underground storm water detention basin. Improvements to the current PVAMC storm water system are being addressed in a separate design project, but the design will not be complete by the time construction for the parking garage expansion will begin. Retention basin 1 (RB1) is where a majority of the campus storm water collects and is the location of the planned underground storm water storage tanks. RB1 frequently overfills since it does not percolate as expected by design. This causes flooding to numerous areas of the campus and requires grounds crews to manually pump water to other areas. It is critical that the underground storm water storage at RB1 be designed and built to detain storm water with a positive connection to the City of Phoenix (COP) storm water system prior to, or during, the construction of the parking garage expansion by the parking garage expansion design-build team. 

The contractor shall provide the complete design and subsequent construction of expanding the parking garage and storm water detention basin.  

PROCUREMENT INFORMATION:
The proposed project will be a competitive, firm-fixed-price contract utilizing the design-build approach outlined in FAR Part 36.3 Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures. This project is planned for advertising in 2019. In accordance with VAAR 836.204, the magnitude of construction is between $10,000,000 and $15,000,000 The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 236220 (size standard $36.5 million) applies to this procurement. The results and analysis of the market research will finalize the determination of the procurement method. The type of socio-economic set-aside, if any, will depend upon the responses to this notice and any other information gathered during the market research process. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENT:
Respondents shall provide a general capabilities statement in the following information:  
Section 1: Provide company name, DUNS number, company address, Point-of-Contact name, phone number and email.
Section 2: Provide company business size based on NAICS code 236220. Also, provide business type (i.e., Large Business, Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Small Business, Hub Zone Small Business, etc.).

Section 4: Provide the type of work your company has performed in the past in support of the same or similar requirement.

<DESC>Enterprise Solution Directorate, Contracting Office, Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado, intends to award a sole source contract for EIS to:
<p>Array Information Technology, Inc. <br />7474 Greenway Center Drive Ste 600<br />Greenbelt MD 20770</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. (Or 41 U.S.C 3304(a)(1)</p>
<p>These activities include, but are not limited to, system sustainment (Operation and Maintenance Tasks), Provide EIS Laboratory and Training Room, identify technical refresh needs, System Administration, System Maintenance, Functional Service Administration (FSA), Network Compliance, Technical updates to include account/user for NIPRNet and SIPRNet, Application Management, Task Management Tool and SharePoint Site Collection Management, SharePoint Data Migration Support, AF Portal Responsibilities, Systems Operations, Customer Training, EIS Help Desk Support, Engineering Services, The Government intends to award a single-award contract with a six (6) month base period, three (3), six (6) month option periods and a six (6) month extension if needed, 30 March 2019 through 30 September 2021.</p>
<p>All communications associated with this request shall be submitted via email to the Point of Contact below.</p>
<p>HQ AFSPC, Enterprise Solutions Directorate (ESD), Contracting Office, Peterson Air Force Base, CO intends to release a solicitation and to negotiate the continued EIS O&amp;M Services to provide AFSPC EIS customers with NIPR and SIPR EIS capabilities and continued continuity with the Air Force Enterprise SharePoint Online Cloud effort. Therefore mitigating the risks associated with duplications of costs and efforts since the SharePoint online (SPO) data migration has been delayed beyond the current period of performance.</p>
<p>The SharePoint Online cloud environment has been attempting to stand up for the last three years. The Government is solidifying the SPO final details for MAJCOM Organization SharePoint sites to migrate their data into. Array has been actively involved in the brainstorming, evaluating, writing, planning, testing, data assessment and site building in the SPO environment for over 2 years with the end effort to migrate NIPR SharePoint data to the SPO. Array is currently engaged in bi-weekly telecons with AFLCMC and all MAJCOMs to understand and embrace the new SPO environment. Array's knowledge-base is critical for the approaching AFSPC NIPR SharePoint data preparation, migration planning, migration and tweaking data and links when migration is complete for a successful transition for the Headquarters, NAF, Center, Wings, GSUs and Tenant units.</p>
<p>An award of a follow-on contract is crucial to make this enterprise SPO "pathfinder" effort successful for the Air Force to solidify a cloud based environment is effective. The risk of losing Array's SPO knowledge-base would cause unneeded delays weakening this initial pathfinder effort hindering AFLCMC/HIB's momentum with this effort as a new incumbent would spend considerable time to ramp up to obtain the knowledge base and hands-on experience. Array Information Technologies Inc. (Array) has approximately1620 man hours over the last two (2) years invested in the preparation of the SPO data migration. An award of the AFSPC EIS follow-on contract will smoothly transition AFSPC's NIPR SharePoint data off our on premise environment and would eliminate all O&amp;M support for this environment, saving the Government funding for O&amp;M services for this effort.</p>
<p>A. Background:</p>
<p>This contract provides HQ AFSPC EIS Services. These services encompass, but not limited to, system administration, system operations, engineering services, training, application management and development, help desk, O&amp;M, migration support, Information Awareness compliance support on NIPR and SIPR environments, as applicable, to support AFSPC SharePoint, Task Management Tool and SPO Cloud environment for the whole Command and tenant units.</p>
<p>The SPO data migration was estimated to be accomplished during the current contract period of performance. Due to multiple delays in solidifying the final details and ability to migrate the data, the migration was unable to take place, therefore causing need for a logical follow-on to complete the SPO data migration and implement fixes after the migration to ensure no issues have occurred during and after the migration.</p>
<p><br />B. Requirements</p>
<p>This effort includes providing operations and maintenance support on the test-bed/training suite located at the contractor's facility and operational systems located around the world. The Contractor provides program management, risk management, safety and quality management; systems engineering; hardware and software maintenance; baseline configuration and data management; Technical Order management; planning, design, test, and evaluation for all system baseline upgrades due to new satellite platforms and preplanned system upgrades; programmed depot maintenance; emergency depot level maintenance; operator and maintainer training; system anomaly tracking, investigation and resolution; system trending analysis; equipment and software license obsolescence management; cybersecurity and processing of information assurance activities for network certification and accreditation.</p>
<p>Qualified sources must demonstrate the ability to deliver this capability with minimal investment by the Government. Qualified sources must additionally demonstrate all of the following capabilities:</p>
<p>(1) Demonstrate an effective approach to administer, manage, and maintain hosted EIS environments IAW disciplined engineering practices and sustain applications, databases, and interfaces in compliance with applicable AF/Department of Defense standards.</p>
<p>(2) Ability to transfer equipment from the current contractor facility and provide a functioning computer laboratory within 30 days of contract stat date in a contractor hosted facility with minimal costs to the Government. The laboratory shall simulate the AFSPC hosted operations production environments. The laboratory environment shall include a stand-alone Active Directory (AD) environment and the AFSPC EIS software.</p>
<p>(3) Demonstrated an effective approach to provide engineering support for migration planning and execution, advanced system analysis, services enhancements, system updates (firmware/application), system-level integration efforts, and technical solutions development.</p>
<p>(4) Demonstrate an effective approach to provide AFSPC EIS application help desk support for 31,000 end-users for AFSPC EIS application issues, sites, and permissions and provide SharePoint Training for designated Site Owners and TMT End Users Training.</p>
<p><br />C. Statement of Capability:</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government to further evaluate capability briefs, release a competitive solicitation, or award a contract. This notice is only seeking potential Prime Contractors, not suppliers of components, materials, software, or services that may be used by a Prime Contractor to deliver this capability.</p>
<p>Due to its unique position and two years of support in the solution for the SPO data migration and application management support after the migration the Enterprise Solution Directorate believes that Array is the only source fully capable of performing this work with no duplicate of costs and effort. No other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements in accordance with (IAW) FAR 6.302-1. Any persons or companies interested in this notice are to respond to the requirements and submit a Statement of Capability (SOC). The SOC must demonstrate the ability to satisfy all of the requirements listed in Paragraph B for continued EIS sustainment support and integration of the SPO data migration capability. This effort must be accomplished in coordination with, and not impede, on-going EIS sustainment activities.</p>

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION SPECIAL NOTICE<br />NUMBER: W900KK-19-R-0006<br />REQUIREMENT: PEO STRI Modernizing Instrumentation Systems Test and Evaluation (MISTE)<br /><br /><strong>1.0 Purpose</strong> <br />This Presolicitation Special Notice is made in accordance with FAR 15.201(C)(5) &amp; (8) and is considered Exchanges with Industry before Receipt of Proposals. The purpose of this notice is to address an outstanding request that was made during the MISTE Presolicitation Conference conducted on December 10, 2018.
<p>a. During discussions regarding the Test Network Modernization (TNM) at Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, AZ Delivery Order (DO) to be awarded at the time of award of the MISTE Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, a question was raised by an industry participant as to whether a Network Survey (data deliverable) conducted under an unrelated contract, could be released by the Government for industry review. <br />b. The subject Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) was generated under Contract W900KK-17-C-0057 P00002 with Advanced IT Concepts, Inc. (AITC) awarded on September 27, 2017.<br />c. The Government representative stated that we would review the CDRL and if it could be released.<br />d. Upon the MISTE PMO review of the document, it was subsequently determined that it does not reflect current or useful information relevant to the MISTE TNM EPG DO. Posting this survey to FBO could lead to misinterpretation and confusion with the current requirement. The MISTE TNM DO requires that the successful offeror conduct their own survey after award of the order in order to avoid any ambiguity in the requirements. <br />e. Conferring with the PEO STRI legal counsel, it was determined that anyone still desiring to review the subject CDRL should submit a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request through ACC Orlando. <br />f. Any submission of a FOIA in this regard should be submitted directly to the assigned MISTE Contract Specialist, Joseph Candelaria.</p>
<p><strong>2.0 Reminder</strong><br />This action does not constitute a solicitation or Request for Proposal (RFP) and shall not be construed as a commitment on the part of the U.S. Government to procure. The exchange of this information is for planning and clarification purposes. Interested industry representatives are also reminded that they are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this notice and submitting a FOIA and any processing charges. No solicitation document exists at this time.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />Agency: Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA)<br />Component: Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES)<br />Subject/Requirement: Military Training and Experience Evaluation Program Modernization</p>
<p><strong>1.0 Description</strong></p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ); IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) TO INVITE INDUSTRY AND OTHER POTENTIAL VENDORS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ACADEMIA, SMALL BUSINESSES, LARGE BUSINESSES AND NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE A WHITE PAPER IN RESPONSE TO THE SUBJECT TOPIC.</p>
<p>1.1 The Defense Human Resources Activity and its component activity, Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES) seeks information from industry, academia, and other organizations to explore existing and emerging technologies related to Digitization / Modernization of the Military Training and Experience Evaluation Program which delivers services to evaluate and document the knowledge, skills, abilities, competencies, and proficiencies gained by service members as a result of military training courses and on-the-job experiences. Subsequently, the outcome of the evaluated courses and occupational experiences (i.e. college credit recommendations to satisfy degree requirements, competency profiles to apply towards certifications, licensure, employment opportunities, etc.) is communicated to the military Services, academic institutions, credentialing organizations, and potential employers.</p>
<p><br />1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for market research information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, DHRA is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.</p>
<p>1.3 The proposed NAICS for this effort is 611710, Educational Support Services (size standard $15M). Comments on this NAICS and suggestions for alternative codes must include supporting rationale.</p>
<p><br /><strong>2.0 Background</strong></p>
<p>2.1 DANTES is currently receiving support under contract number N00189-15-C-Z075 for the manual evaluation of military training, educational, and occupational experiences. Those experiences are translated into academic credit recommendations that are currently accepted at over 2,000 academic institutions, as a form of prior learning assessment, to satisfy postsecondary certificate and degree requirements. (Institutional acceptance of these credits are at the discretion of individual colleges and universities and vary greatly based on institutional credit acceptance and award policies.) These evaluations are conducted either onsite or virtually, with Service-level training schools, located across the country by a team of multidisciplinary Subject Matter Experts from regionally accredited colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Although this evaluation methodology has served the Defense Department well over the years, several factors necessitate modernization of the program. This includes the need to better leverage technological advances, keep pace with the changes within the postsecondary learning landscape, provide greater scalability to increase the amount and frequency of evaluations, to reduce costs associated with traditional on-site reviews, and expand the ability for evaluations to include competencies, in addition to academic credit recommendations, that can be easily accessed by the military Services, academic institutions, credentialing agencies, and potential employers.</p>
<p><br />2.2 The Government is specifically performing Market Research to see if there are potential vendors who can provide <strong>a cost effective and demonstrable solution</strong> to:</p>
<p>Improve the Defense Department's capacity to evaluate, document, and communicate the knowledge, skills, abilities, competencies, and proficiencies (KSAC&amp;P) gained by service members as a result of military training courses and on-the-job experiences to a wide range of stakeholders (i.e. the military Services, academic institutions, credentialing agencies, potential employers, etc.) through automation. The Contractor shall develop and implement a digital evaluation methodology that replaces the traditional manual review process. The digital evaluation methodology shall leverage a combination of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and related technologies, paired with leading or emergent taxonomies used to support college degree completion, career pathways, credentialing, industry/civilian workforce competency frameworks, and prior learning assessment methodologies. The new digital evaluation methodology may include the evaluation of classified course content (classified at the SECRET level).When necessary, digital evaluations may be supplemented by, or combined with, manual reviews (virtual or on-site) and periodic, on-site inspections. The Contractor shall establish the technological capability to streamline the collection, review, analysis, documentation, and communication of course and occupational related material in a readily consumable manner (i.e. modern application program interface (API) frameworks, open data architecture, etc.) that supports broader analysis and integration across programs, systems, and platforms of relevant stakeholders. The Contractor shall provide appropriate personnel, data management, quality control, and customer/stakeholder support necessary to support program execution.</p>
<p>Regardless of evaluation methodology, the output of each evaluation shall align to evaluation rubrics (referenced in PWS Section 4.3.3.5), be formatted to be stored within a Digital Catalog (referenced in PWS Section 4.4.2.1) and, at a minimum, include:<br /><br />&bull; KSAC&amp;Ps as the building blocks for academic credit recommendations as well as alignment with and mapping to non-academic credentials<br />&bull; College credit recommendations and competency profiles that clearly demonstrate quality, transparency, portability, and market value. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o College credit recommendations, in terms of semester hours, noting academic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; course equivalents&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Competency profiles and proficiency statements with levels that delineate and document the degree to which KSAC&amp;Ps are achieved through a training or occupational experience. Competencies shall be mapped in a manner that align to the entry to practice profiles for learners to become credentialed in a discipline as determined by certifying and professional accrediting bodies, i.e. Apprenticeships, Certifications, Licensure, Strategic Career Pathways, etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Alphanumeric course identifiers that accompany each credit or competency award that includes information such as prefix, level code, century digit, decade digit, unit digit, lab code, skill level, etc.<br /><br />&bull; Supporting documentation (i.e. course artifacts such as syllabi, textbooks, learning assessments, etc.) to justify credit and competency awards, standardized course identifiers to assist with credit and competency mapping, etc.<br />&bull; Standardized scorecards that provide actionable items that military training facilities can use for continuous improvement in areas such as curriculum, instruction, and assessment.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the outputs of course and occupational evaluations shall result in: 1) college credit recommendations that are accepted and applied to satisfy certificate and degree requirements at regionally and nationally accredited colleges and universities; 2) competency profiles and proficiency statements that are accepted by credentialing agencies and applied towards completion of certification and licensure requirements; and 3) competency statements with proficiency levels that can be adapted to auto populate draft resumes tailored to service members' training and occupational experiences to validate KSAC&amp;Ps to potential civilian employers.</p>
<p><strong>3.0 Requested Information</strong></p>
<p>3.1 Industry feedback is requested on the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS)</span></strong> (located in Appendix 1) for this requirement. Please list any challenges or potential performance roadblocks related to fulfilling the PWS requirements and any suggestions for improving the PWS language. Additionally, the Government seeks answers to the following questions concerning this requirement. Please consider providing responses:</p>
<p>&bull; What is industry's capacity to execute the requirements? Specifically, is the maturity of academic and competency frameworks, digital evaluation methodologies, and information technology systems sufficient to begin the digital assessment of military training courses and occupational experiences for knowledge, skills, abilities, competencies, and proficiencies at the projected contract award date in Spring 2020? If so, please articulate that capability. If not, please articulate potential challenges and proposed mitigation strategies related to conducting military course and occupational evaluations to fulfill the PWS requirements.</p>
<p>&bull; What data sources, documents, and format requirements are needed from military training sites for course and occupational reviews to be conducted digitally?</p>
<p>&bull; What additional information, if any, is needed from the Government to determine the Contractor's cost and performance management approach? Please provide a firm fixed price, non-binding, rough order of magnitude estimate for a 48-month period of performance under the attached PWS.</p>
<p>&bull; Please indicate relevant past performance or current projects that are similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity to the PWS requirements. For similar projects/pilots, please highlight challenges and planned/or completed actions to address those challenges.</p>
<p>&bull; Please indicate willingness and ability to conduct an in-person demonstration of proposed technological solutions to a panel of government personnel.</p>
<p><strong>4.0 Responses</strong></p>
<p>4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.</p>
<p>4.2 White papers are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">due no later 29 Jan 2019, 12:00 PM Eastern Time</span></strong>.

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 2.15pt 0.2pt -0.25pt">The USAFA is seeking unclassified research white papers and proposals that do not contain proprietary information. If proprietary information is submitted it is the offerors' responsibility to mark the relevant portions of their proposal as specified in USAFA-BAA-2015. CAStLE performs a range of structural integrity research tasks in support of multiple Government, academic and commercial sponsors. Among these pursuits, CAStLE engages in a wide range of corrosion engineering and material science research efforts, with more emphasis on applied research, and that part of development not related to a specific system or hardware procurement.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 107%; TEXT-INDENT: 0in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 2.15pt 0.2pt -0.25pt">Current CAStLE research strengths include: high temperature materials development; advanced barrier coatings; static strength, static stability design, corrosion modeling, prevention and control; validation testing, analysis and methods development; computational structural and fracture mechanics; failure analysis, flight data acquisition system development, installation, maintenance and data analysis; structural risk analysis, and support of the USAF Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP). The interaction between corrosion and cracking damage mechanisms and their effect on the structural integrity has been a long-standing interest of CAStLE. There is Department of Defense (DoD) level interest in material degradation in structures-to include corrosion, cracking and other service-related damage mechanisms. The DoD level material degradation interest is the subject of this CALL, while also serving a dual public purpose.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 107%; TEXT-INDENT: 0in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 2.15pt 0.2pt -0.25pt">This CALL is focused on fundamental research that can lead to the future development of capabilities to prevent and control corrosion and degradation of materials and the structures of systems and facilities. The ultimate goal of these capabilities is reducing costs, improving availability of systems and increasing the safety of military assets, which serve a dual interest in public structures and facilities. Projects must be new research efforts. Proposals for the continuation of existing research projects funded under previous grant or cooperative agreement awards are not desired. Collaboration among proposing institutions is strongly encouraged.</p>

This is complicated by implementation of new materials and processes (e.g. non-chrome coatings, additively-manufactured components). Focus is to accurately predict corrosion in DoD systems via validated methods; these predictions and solutions will be mirrored in applicability to the public sector.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 2.15pt 0.2pt -0.25pt">Real-Time Condition Assessment</p>

Focus is to assess corrosion health of systems and infrastructure to integrate with maintenance strategies.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 2.15pt 0.2pt -0.25pt">Advanced Materials and Processing</p>

Focus is to investigate new materials that can handle diverse environments while meeting environmental/health regulations.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 2.15pt 0.2pt -0.25pt">Product Support</p>

Focus is to reduce corrosion as a maintenance cost and availability driver. Those tactics and efforts that are valuable</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 2.15pt 0.2pt 36.5pt">to the DoD will also serve as valuable to industry, as degradation of public systems is increasingly prevalent.</p>

<p>Title: W9126G19R0038, VOLAR Barracks Renovations Buildings 2387 &amp; 2389 at Fort Polk, Louisiana.</p>
<p>Fort Worth District Corps of Engineers Soliciting Comments on the Potential Use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) at</p>
<p>U.S. Army Engineer District, Fort Worth<br />ATTN: CESWF-CT (Eugene A. Gibbs) Eugene.A.Gibbs@usace.army.mil <br />Post Office Box 17300 or 819 Taylor Street (2a17) (if using express mail)<br />Fort Worth, TX 76102-0300</p>
<p>The Corps of Engineers Fort Worth District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) for this large scale construction project (exceeding $25 million). This market survey is being posted for Project: VOLAR Barracks Renovation Buildings 2387 &amp; 2389 at Fort Polk, Louisiana. This will result in a solicitation for a Construction contract for a single C- Type awarded contract for Fiscal Year 19.</p>
<p>THIS IS A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT SURVEY ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, REQUEST FOR QUOTE, OR INVITATION FOR BID. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Government plans to renovate 2 VOLAR Barracks Buildings 2387 &amp; 2389 at Fort Polk, Louisiana.</p>
<p>Scope Summary:</p>
<p>This project shall include the design and construction renovations for Barracks buildings 2387 &amp; 2389, including site and drainage improvements. The site work shall include but not be limited to site grading, drainage improvements, utility improvements, asphalt and concrete construction. Both barracks shall be designed and constructed to house one soldier per room. This project also requires providing for 30% domestic hot water with solar for the barracks.</p>
<p>Magnitude: $25,000,000 - $100,000,000</p>
<p>Period of Performance: 600 Days from Notice to Proceed</p>
<p>Project Labor Agreement:<br />A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)<br />Policy:</p>
<p>(a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>(1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>(2) Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause<br />52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the<br />Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Fort Worth District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?</p>
<p>b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement?<br />What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the<br />Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?</p>
<p>d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.</p>
<p>g. Completion of anticipated projects will require extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via e-mail to the Contract Specialist, Eugene A. Gibbs, at Eugene.A.Gibbs@usace.army.mil and courtesy copy (cc) the Contracting Officer, Mr. John H. Rodgers, at John.H.Rodgers@usace.army.mil no later than 2:00 p.m., 5 February 2019.</p>

<SUBJECT>CLC Construction, Canandaigua VAMC, Notice of Intent to Sole Source Nurse Call System
<SOLNBR>W912QR-19-R-0002-NCNOI
<RESPDATE>013019
<CONTACT>Brenna A. Crawford, Contract Specialist, Phone 5023156182, Email brenna.a.crawford@usace.army.mil
<DESC>This notice serves as a notice of intent. The statutory authority permitting sole sourcing for this acquisition is 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Directorate of Contracting intends to insert a brand name specification, for Rauland-Borg Nurse Call and Code Blue System, into a design-bid-build, firm fixed price (FFP) contract for the Veteran Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) located in Canandaigua, NY. This phase of the project will consist of construction of a 120 bed Community Living Center (CLC) complex and a Community Center; renovation of Building 9 for Domiciliary; renovation of Buildings 3, 4, and 5 to support outpatient functions; and demolition of Buildings 33 and 34. This project will also include infrastructure enhancements and site development work, such as utilities, parking and landscaping.<br /><br />The design calls for the installation of a Rauland-Borg Nurse Call and Code Blue System similar to the existing Rauland-Borg Nurse Call and Code Blue System used at the VAMC Canandaigua campus currently. The integration of a newly installed Rauland-Borg Nurse Call and Code Blue System into the existing campus wide nurse call system is critical to maintaining the overall integrity of the medical center's nurse call system. The existing Rauland-Borg Nurse Call and Code Blue System is Proprietary and any new nurse call and code blue equipment that is added/connected to the existing systems must be Underwriters Laboratory (UL) listed and labeled. Currently, there is no UL listing for an nurse call and code blue system comprised of non-Rauland-Borg equipment connected to a Rauland-Borg Nurse Call and Code Blue System.
<p><br />The current VA and USACE design standards and contract documents require the installation of a UL listed and labeled nurse call and code blue system.</p>
<p>It is therefore the Government's position that the new nurse call system for the VAMC Canandaigua project must seamlessly interface with the existing nurse call system used throughout the campus, and that the Rauland-Borg system is proprietary and any attempt to interface with other systems, if possible, is cost prohibitive. The Rauland-Borg system is the only feasible alternative for the VAMC Canandaigua project.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 30 January 2019. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Brenna.a.crawford@usace.army.mil. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>

The offeror certifies, <br />to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared <br />ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or <br />had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in <br />connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government <br />contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the <br />submission of offers; or</p>
<p><br />commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, <br />making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen <br />property; and</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a <br />Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this <br />clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any <br />delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains <br />unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been <br />assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial <br />challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally <br />determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has <br />failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not <br />delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles <br />the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax <br />because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not <br />be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and <br />the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a <br />hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax <br />Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer <br />is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior <br />opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax <br />liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until <br />the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer <br />is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not <br />delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because <br />enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order <br />13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired <br />under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor <br />Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use <br />of child labor.</p>
<p>(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the <br />acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall <br />indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to <br />this solicitation is predominantly-</p>

<p>(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established <br />catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work <br />under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing <br />commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the <br />Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the <br />solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute <br />the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting <br />Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

<DESC>Contract Delivery Service - Contracting Opportunities<br /><br />Contract Delivery Service is a contractual agreement between the U.S. Postal Service and an individual or company for the delivery and collection of mail. The typical service required at the local Post Office<sup>TM</sup> will involve sorting mail for the route, driving to the route, delivering mail and parcels to specified addresses, picking up collection mail, and returning to the Post Office. The contract route will operate six days per week, Monday through Saturday, with possible Sunday deliveries and may include holidays. The carrier is required to use their own vehicle for mail delivery service.<br /><br />Contract Delivery Service carriers are not USPS employees but are independent contractors who provide service on specific routes. By becoming a contract delivery service supplier for the USPS, you sign on as an independent contractor who delivers and collects mail. You will not be an employee of the USPS, which means you won't be eligible for benefits.<br /><br />You will be required to pass both a background check and a drug test before the USPS can consider you for a contract delivery service contract. Even though you will not be an actual employee, the USPS is a government agency; which means an extensive screening process is necessary. You also must be 21 years old to be considered for a contractor position.

Constant innovation and rapid technology advances are occurring throughout the world. Partnerships with commercial industry, the civil maritime sector, and others will be used to leverage these approaches and increase flexibility and agility, reduce cost, improve technology and capability insertion, and decrease program development cycles. The OTA offers an alternative to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)&#8208;based acquisitions, allowing for access to participation by non-traditional defense contractors with innovative solutions that may not normally desire to participate in government procurement. <br /><br />Requirement <br /><br />NUWC requires innovative technological solutions to address current and future security threats in the undersea and maritime environment.

Following receipt of quotes, the Government will perform an evaluation using a comparative evaluation of the services quoted in accordance with FAR 13.106-2(b)(3). The Government will compare quotes to one another to select the quote that best benefits the Government by fulfilling the requirement. 

Contractors may submit more than one quote; however, contractors are strongly encouraged to submit their best technical solutions and prices in response to this request for quote.

9. CLAUSES AND PROVISIONS
The full text of FAR and VAAR provisions or clauses may be accessed electronically at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html and http://www.va.gov/oal/library/vaar/index.asp.

The capability shall include information as to the key personnel and their qualifications to include proof that the Radiological Physicist is Board Certified; a description of experience performing annual radiological survey service to meet annual requirement of Ionizing radiology equipment per Joint Commission Standards, ACR and CFR, and other radiological regulatory agencies, and a sample report as described in the Statement of Work, Section 4.j. Capability statements that are merely an overview of what the contractor offers will be determined incomplete.
  Completed Price Schedule (Section 7. above) to include Unit Price, Total Price, and Grand Total. Failure to provide complete pricing, including pricing for each CLIN, will result in the contractor s package being determined to be incomplete.
  The Offeror may submit up to three (3) past performance references, including both the reference information and details of the work performance. The Contracting Officer may utilize all available records (e.g. PPIPRS and FAPIIS) as well to evaluate a contractor s past performance.
  Acknowledgement of any solicitation amendments
  A statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation.
  Offers that fail to furnish required representation or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation, may be excluded from consideration. 
The following provisions are incorporated into 52.212-1 as an addendum to this contract. Provisions that are incorporated by reference (by Citation Number, Title, and Date), have the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

52.204-16 Commercial and Government Entity Code Reporting (JUL 2016)
52.217-5  Evaluation of Options (52.217-5)
The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 15 days.
(End of Clause)
(Addendum to FAR 52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES)
For the purposes of the award of this Contract, the Government intends to evaluate the option to extend services under FAR 52.217-8 as follows:
The evaluation will consider the possibility that the option can be exercised at any time, and can be exercised in increments of one to six months, but for no more than a total of six months during the life of the contract. The evaluation will assume that the prices for any option exercised under FAR 52.217-8 will be at the same rates as those in effect under the contract at the time the option is exercised. The evaluation will therefore assume that the addition of the price or prices of any possible extension or extensions under FAR 52.217-8 to the total price for the basic requirement and the total price for the priced options has the same effect on the total price of all proposals relative to each other, and will not affect the ranking of proposals based on price, unless, after reviewing the proposals, the Government determines that there is a basis for finding otherwise. This evaluation will not obligate the Government to exercise any option under FAR 52.217-8.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be issued.

This solicitation is a request for quotations (RFQ). The government anticipates awarding a five (5) year Fixed Price (FP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract resulting from this solicitation. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-101, effective 10/26/2018.

Quotes will be reviewed by qualified evaluators to initially determine their acceptability. Each quote must contain all the information required by the RFQ. A quote may be determined to be unacceptable if required information is missing or if the quote materially deviates from the requirements of the RFQ. Unacceptable quotes will not be considered for further evaluation or selection. A responsibility determination will be made in accordance with FAR 9.1, Responsible Prospective Contractors.

52.217-5 Evaluation of Options (JUL 1990)
(Addendum to FAR 52.217-5)
For the purposes of the award of this Contract, the Government intends to evaluate the option to extend services under FAR 52.217-8 as follows: The evaluation will consider the possibility that the option can be exercised in increments of one to six months, but for no more than a total of six months during the life of the contract.  The evaluation will assume that the prices for any option exercised under FAR 52.217-8 will be at the same rates as those in effect under the contract at the time the option is exercised.  The evaluation will therefore assume that the addition of the price or prices of any possible extension or extensions under FAR 52.217-8 to the total price for the basic requirement has the same effect on the total price of all proposals relative to each other, and will not affect the ranking of proposals based on price, unless, after reviewing the proposals, the Government determines that there is a basis for finding otherwise. This evaluation will not obligate the Government to exercise any option under FAR 52.217-8.

<DESC>C-ARCHITECT AND ENGINEERING SERVICES<br />"Small Business Set-Aside Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for Architect-Engineering (A-E) Services within the Northwestern Division (MEGA Phase B)"
<p>General Information<br /><br />Document Type: Synopsis for A-E Service Contracts<br /><br />Solicitation Number: W912DQ18R3000<br />Posted Date:</p>
<p>Original Response Date:</p>
<p>Current Response Date:</p>
<p>Classification Code: C - Architect and Engineering Service</p>
<p>1. Contract Information: The Northwestern Division (NWD) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement to acquire Architect-Engineer (A-E) Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste (HTRW)/Environmental Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for execution of its environmental mission. This contract acquisition is part of NWD's Phase B of the Multiple Environmental Government Acquisition (MEGA).</p>
<p>These regional A-E contract acquisitions will be conducted in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineers statute (40 USC Chapter 11), and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 236.6. The majority of the work will be located in NWD (including Kansas City, Omaha, and Seattle Districts), with the potential for work on EPA Region 2 projects.</p>
<p>In support of this effort, the Government intends to award contracts to three (3) Small Business firms sharing $12 million in total contract capacity. However, if the Contracting Officer determines during the selection process that fewer or more than three (3) contracts should be awarded, based on the selection criteria, the Contracting Officer has the discretion of adjusting that number, or awarding none at all.</p>
<p>This announcement is open to all Small Businesses. The period of performance for each contract will be five (5) years. It is anticipated that the contracts will be awarded not earlier than April 2018.</p>
<p>Task orders will be issued as the need arises during the contract ordering period. Task order assignments will be determined with consideration of each firm's specialized experience and technical competence, professional qualifications, past performance, capacity, and knowledge of locality. These task orders may be either firm fixed-price or cost reimbursable type orders. There is no limit on the value of individual task orders and the period of performance on individual task orders shall not exceed five (5) years.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 -- Engineering Services. For the purposes of this procurement a concern is considered a Small Business if its average annual gross receipts are $15 million or less. More than one contract may be awarded for the same scope of work. Under the Selection of Architects and Engineers statute, price competition is not allowed for A-E contracts.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the requirements, projects are completed in phases such as preliminary assessment, remedial investigation, feasibility study, and then design. The project scope will be reviewed to determine whether the requirement can be accomplished using a firm fixed-price task order or whether uncertainties will require the use of a cost reimbursable task order.</p>
<p>When the requirement is identified, the government will notify all contractors in the pool that an evaluation will be conducted. The notification will include whether the contractor's SF 330 will be used, or if the government requires unique experience or qualifications to be submitted for the task order evaluation. Specialized experience and technical competence, professional qualifications, past performance, capacity, and knowledge of locality will be considered for task orders to determine which firm is best qualified to accomplish the work.</p>
<p>The period of performance for task orders awarded under the IDCs will be determined based upon the work requirement (not to exceed five (5) years) and will be included in the task order solicitation and negotiated award documents. A Request for Price Proposal (RFPP) will be issued to the selected firm for each task order.</p>
<p>The Service Contract Labor Standards statute is applicable to this solicitation and resulting contracts and will be incorporated into same. Service wage rates will be determined based on the locality where the services will be performed.</p>
<p>Prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be eligible for contract award. In order to register in SAM, a firm must have a Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number from Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B). If a firm does not have a DUNS number, one can be requested by visiting D&amp;B at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Additionally, in accordance with FAR Part 22.1303, all firms must complete their VETS-4212 report. Information can be found at the Department of Labor website https://www.dol.gov/vets/vets4212.htm, or call the service center at 1-866-237-0275; you will be asked to provide your company name, employer identification number (EIN), and DUNS number.</p>
<p>2. Project Information: Firms must be capable of performing work on a wide variety of HTRW sites in a manner that complies with federal, state, and local regulations and laws, and within time frames required. At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the Prime/Joint Venture (JV) firm. It is anticipated that a majority of the work will be performed within NWD under the CERCLA regulatory framework. These contracts may be used to provide A-E services for EPA Region 2 projects.</p>
<p>Specific needs will be determined based upon project requirements as described in each task order. Project assignments will typically require performance on-site and in an office setting. Selected firms will work on a variety of hazardous waste and other environmental projects, including, but not limited to contaminated soil and groundwater, contaminated sediments, radioactive and mixed wastes, underground storage tanks and fueling systems, and habitat restoration and mitigation.</p>
<p>Assignments will include Preliminary Assessments, site investigations, subsurface exploration, chemical sampling, testing and analyses, hazard evaluations, feasibility and other engineering studies and reports, groundwater and other modeling, contaminant fate and transport analysis, human health and ecological risk assessments, Proposed Plans, Decision Documents, HTRW remedial designs, preparation of plans and specifications, cost estimating, value engineering screenings and studies, field inspections, verification of existing conditions, pilot studies, vapor intrusion studies, surveying and mapping, community relations, construction-phase services (engineering design during construction, checking design drawings), Five Year Reviews, archaeological investigations and mitigation, wetlands determination and mitigation studies, storm water design (including drainage studies and hydraulic modeling), evaluations of green technologies and energy conservation measures, and other related services.</p>
<p>3. Primary Selection Criteria: Selection of the firms will be based on the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance, first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion. Additional consideration will be given for experience and qualifications by the Prime or Joint Venture (JV) firms. Criteria A through E are primary criteria and will be evaluated for all offerors.</p>
<p>(A) Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm demonstrated for a broad range of CERCLA HTRW work performed under the CERCLA regulatory framework. Firms will be evaluated for experience and competence in areas 1 through 3 below, clearly demonstrated in the past five (5) years. The most highly qualified firms will have extensive experience in all of the following areas:</p>
<p>1. Remedial Investigations, Risk Assessments (human health and ecological), Feasibility Studies, development of UFP-QAPPs, execution of field investigations including soil and groundwater sampling, installation of monitoring wells, groundwater modeling, and Remedial Design. Experience with differing contaminants in various media including soil, groundwater, sediment, and bedrock, should be demonstrated. Experience providing A-E services for HTRW projects located within NWD should also be demonstrated. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section F of the SF 330.</p>
<p>2. Demonstrated quality management processes and procedures that result in high quality work products. The Prime/JV firm should demonstrate a strong understanding of quality management principles by describing quality management roles and responsibilities and organizational structure, and by documenting quality management process and procedures. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>3. Managing cost reimbursable contracts. The Prime/JV firm should demonstrate experience managing government cost reimbursable contracts as the prime including accounting systems, cost tracking, managing cost and schedule variances, cost/budget projections, and indirect rate adjustments. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>(B) Professional qualifications of a firm's staff and team consultants to be assigned to this contract. The education, professional registration, proposed job title, overall and relevant HTRW work performed under the CERCLA Regulatory Framework, longevity with the firm, and experience of key personnel will be considered. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel. The number of personnel is addressed under the capacity criterion below. Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications of their staff in these key disciplines, which are listed in descending order of importance. Responding firms shall submit resumes for each of the following key disciplines: (1) Project Management; (2) Hydrogeology / Geology; (3) Civil/Geotechnical Engineering; (4) Chemistry; (5) Environmental / Process Engineering; (6) Risk Assessment; and (7) Industrial Hygiene. A maximum of three (3) resumes for Project Manager, and a maximum of two (2) resumes for each of the other disciplines shall be submitted. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section E of the SF 330.</p>
<p><br />(C) Past performance on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, management/business relations, and compliance with performance schedules. The Contractor Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) is the primary source of information on past performance. CPARS will be queried by the Government for all firms submitting a SF 330. No submittals are required by the offerors for this criteria. Each project in Section F of the SF 330 shall include owner's contact information. If deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant team subcontractors may also be considered. The board may seek information on past performance from other sources, but is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm, if none is available from CPARS. When evaluating past performance, the board will consider the relevancy of performance evaluations on A-E services contracts to the proposed contract.</p>
<p>(D) Capacity: The board will consider available capacity of key disciplines identified above from the Prime/JV firm and its team consultants to perform work in the required time. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H and Part II of the SF330.</p>
<p>(E) Knowledge of the Locality: The board will evaluate a Prime/JV firm's knowledge and experience with geological features and the state/ local regulatory agencies. Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispersed geographic area, therefore, responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities to serve projects located throughout the USACE NWD. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Sections F and H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>4. Secondary Selection Criteria: The following secondary criterion will only be used as a tie-breaker among technically equal firms. The secondary criterion will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation. The secondary criterion is Volume of DoD A-E Contract Awards in the last 12 months. Responding firms should cite all contract numbers, task orders and modifications, award dates and total negotiated fees for any DoD A-E contract awarded within the past twelve (12) months. This information will assist in effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>5. Submittal Requirements: Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit one (1) original plus five (5) copies and one (1) CD or DVD with searchable Adobe PDF files of one SF 330 (03/2013 edition) for the prime firm that includes all team consultants. Include the firm's DUNS number and CAGE codes in the SF 330, Part I, Sections B and C. A maximum of ten (10) projects for the proposed team, including joint ventures and teaming partners, shall be shown in Section F. For the ten (10) projects submitted in Section F of the SF 330, a "project" is defined as work performed at one site or at a single installation. An IDC contract is not a project. A project may contain multiple task orders or contracts if they are for multiple phases of the project at the same site or installation. Project descriptions shall clearly state extent of work performed by the team, extent of work completed, and dates of completion.</p>
<p>If the offeror provides a specific task order as its "project," it shall provide the base contract number(s) and the task order number(s) for reference purposes. If the offeror provides a site-specific contract as its "project," it shall provide the contract number for reference purposes.</p>
<p>Firms should include information regarding the Secondary Selection Criteria in Section H of the SF 330. The SF 330 shall have a total page limitation of 70 printed pages with Section H limited to ten (10) pages, and Part II is excluded from the 70 printed page limit. Double-sided sheets will count as two pages. Page sheets of 11 inches X 17 inches will be counted as two (2) pages if printed on one side, and four (4) pages if printed on both sides. For all SF 330 sections, use no smaller than 11 pt. font. Solicitation packages are not provided. This is not a request for proposal.</p>

A portion of the US Army rotary-wing aviator population cannot achieve a comfortable helmet fit using standard Army Aviation Life Support Equipment (ALSE) fitting procedures. USAARL administers the US Army Aviation Helmet Problem Fit Program. Through the Problem Fit Program, USAARL ALSE technicians, working in conjunction with Army flight surgeons and biomechanics experts, attempt to provide this subset of the rotary-wing aviation population with a comfortable helmet fit through helmet liner modifications. Accommodation techniques included modification of the Thermo Plastic Liner (TPL), which is the standard-issue liner for the HGU-56/P AIHS, and replacement of the TPL with a Super Comfort Liner (SCL). The TPL and SCL helmet liners are manufactured in extra-extra small, extra-small, small, medium, large, and extra-large sizes to match the six sizes of HGU-56/P AIHS. The HGU-56/P AIHS, TPL, and SCL are all manufactured by the same company, the Gentex Corporation, Inc., of Carbondale, PA. .</p>
<p>USAARL will be conducting a study to investigate the effect of helmet liner (TPL and SCL) modifications on the blunt impact protection provided by the HGU-56/P AIHS. To support this research, TPL and SCL helmet liners are required.</p>
<p>Thermo Plastic Liners are required with the minimum essential characteristics:<br />&bull; Liners must be approved as part of the standard-issue HGU-56/P AIHS helmet assembly; approved items that comprise the standard-issue HGU-56/P AIHS helmet assembly are listed on Aviation Life Support Equipment Drawing number 1680-ALSE-101 titled "Helmet Assembly."<br />&bull; Liners must have a minimum of four layers of thermoplastic material<br />&bull; Liners must have a minimum of one layer of washable cloth material as the interface between the head and thermoplastic material. <br />&bull; Liners must be sized to match the six sizes of HGU-56/P AIHS<br />o Quantity 10 extra-extra small<br />o Quantity 10 extra small<br />o Quantity 10 small<br />o Quantity 10 medium<br />o Quantity 10 large<br />o Quantity 10 extra large</p>

<p>Factor 1 Technical<br />Factor 2 Price</p>
<p>(b) Basis for Award &amp; Evaluation</p>
<p>This will be a Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procurement. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without discussions with offerors. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The LPTA process is selected as appropriate for this acquisition because the best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable quotation with the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>An overall technical rating must be at least "ACCEPTABLE" in order to be eligible for award. An "UNACCEPTABLE" rating, in any factor, results in the overall technical proposal being rated "UNACCEPTABLE." An overall technical rating of "UNACCEPTABLE" makes a quotation ineligible for award.</p>

All quotations submitted with equivalent product shall be IAW 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal specified criteria and quotations shall provide a matrix that directly points back to all MEC's. It is the Contractors Responsibility to provide enough information to show how their "Or Equal" product meets the required MEC's and is comparable to the requested Brand.</p>

<p>Factor 1 - Technical <br />The degree to which the offeror's quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide the requested brand name items that meet the salient characteristics described in the SOW attachment and can meet the delivery schedule.</p>
<p>Table A-1. Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Price</p>
<p>The offeror's price quotes will be evaluated to determine the price is fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 12.209 and FAR 13.106-3.</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of provision)</p>

<p>(2) When return, correction, or replacement is required, transportation charges and responsibility for the supplies while in transit shall be borne by the Contractor. However, the Contractor's liability for the transportation charges shall not exceed an amount equal to the cost of transportation by the usual commercial method of shipment between the place of delivery specified in this contract and the Contractor's plant, and return.</p>
<p>(3) Any supplies or parts thereof, corrected or furnished in replacement under this clause, shall also be subject to the terms of this clause to the same extent as supplies initially delivered. The warranty, with respect to supplies or parts thereof, shall be equal in duration to that in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause and shall run from the date of delivery of the corrected or replaced supplies.</p>

<p>(c) Remedies available to the Government.</p>
<p>(1) The Contracting Officer shall give written notice to the Contractor of any breach of warranties in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause within 45 days after discovery of the defect.</p>

<p>(ii) Retain such supplies and reduce the contract price by an amount equitable under the circumstances.</p>
<p>(3) (i) If the contract provides for inspection of supplies by sampling procedures, conformance of suppliers or components subject to warranty action shall be determined by the applicable sampling procedures in the contract. The Contracting Officer--</p>
<p>(A) May, for sampling purposes, group any supplies delivered under this contract;</p>
<p>(B) Shall require the size of the sample to be that required by sampling procedures specified in the contract for the quantity of supplies on which warranty action is proposed;</p>
<p>(C) May project warranty sampling results over supplies in the same shipment or other supplies contained in other shipments even though all of such supplies are not present at the point of reinspection; provided, that the supplies remaining are reasonably representative of the quantity on which warranty action is proposed; and</p>
<p>(D) Need not use the same lot size as on original inspection or reconstitute the original inspection lots.</p>

<p>(A) Fails to make redelivery of the corrected or replaced supplies within the time established for their return; or</p>
<p>(B) Fails either to accept return of the nonconforming supplies or fails to make progress after their return to correct or replace them so as to endanger performance of the delivery schedule, and in either of these circumstances does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure.</p>
<p>(ii) Instead of correction or replacement by the Government, the Contracting Officer may require an equitable adjustment of the contract price. In addition, if the Contractor fails to furnish timely disposition instructions, the Contracting Officer may dispose of the nonconforming supplies for the Contractor's account in a reasonable manner. The Government is entitled to reimbursement from the Contractor, or from the proceeds of such disposal, for the reasonable expenses of the care and disposition of the nonconforming supplies, as well as for excess costs incurred or to be incurred.</p>
<p>(5) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of this contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<p><br />252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal <br />Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to <br />ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br /><br />(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br />Solicitation:</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Item No. Supplies/Service Quantity Unit Unit price Amount<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />0001............................

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(a)<em> Definition. </em>"Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(e)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) terminate the contract for default.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.</span></p>

<p>The Grantee (Comisi&oacute;n Nacional del Agua) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop the CONAGUA Water Quality Improvement Project Technical Assistance.</p>
<p>The Grantee is for seeking technical support for the preliminary field studies and related assessments for implementing superoxygenation technology at the Valle de Bravo water reservoir ("Reservoir") outside of Mexico City, Mexico.  The Reservoir is one of seven reservoirs that comprise the Cutzamala System ("System"), the largest single source of water for the greater Mexico City Metropolitan Area, providing approximately 24 percent of the potable water to city's 21.3 million inhabitants.  The Reservoir comprises an estimated 35 percent of the System's total water supply and has a storage capacity of approximately 394 billion liters of water.  Due to erosion and sedimentation, the Reservoir's storage capacity has reduced by approximately 21 percent since it was originally constructed in 1947.</p>
<p>In addition to this reduction, the combination of erosion, sedimentation, and increased human activity (e.g. deforestation, fertilization, effluent from livestock, and municipal and industrial discharges) have led to the introduction of high concentrations of nutrients, such as nitrates, phosphates, iron, and silica into the Reservoir.  The high nutrient concentration has prompted a damaging eutrophication process at the Reservoir, resulting in the development of large quantities of algae and plant life that diminish oxygen in the water and hinder the Reservoir's function as a source of drinking water to the Mexico City Metropolitan Area.  As a direct consequence, water originating from the Reservoir has put additional technological and cost stains on the System's water treatment processes.</p>
<p>The objective of the Valle de Bravo Water Quality Improvement Project Technical Assistance is to provide early-stage support in deploying SuperOxygenation units at two sites located in the Reservoir.  The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $530,756 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency ("USTDA").</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals ("RFP"), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background Definitional Mission report are available from USTDA, at 1101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1100, Arlington, VA 22209.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>

<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA-financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source, and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit an original copy (in English and Spanish), and electronic copy (in English and Spanish, PDF file preferred) of their proposal to the Grantee at the above address no later than by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2:00 PM (local time in Mexico City, Mexico) on February 22, 2019</span></strong>.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

Product Description
Salient Characteristics 
 Literature Review 
Flow Cytometers


1. SCOPE OF WORK:  

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Non-Expendable Equipment National Program has identified the Flow Cytometers (also known as Cytometers) product line as a candidate for a VA-wide (otherwise referred to as  national ) single Requirements contract award. Cytometers are laser-based, laboratory chemical analyzers that measure and characterize cells and cellular constituents. Modern Cytometers are able to analyze many thousand particles per second, in "real time" and they separate, quantify, and analyze cells by suspending them in a stream of fluid (sheathing fluid) and passing them through a detection system.  Cytometry is routinely used in the diagnosis of health disorders, especially blood cancers, but has many other applications in basic research, clinical practice and clinical trials. In addition, cytometry technology can be adapted to provide a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective means for detecting and characterizing bacteria. It is also commonly used for research because it is ideal for evaluating drug resistance, detecting tumor cell DNA aneuploidy, immunophenotyping, and analyzing tumor cell proliferation. A common variation involves linking the analytical capability of the cytometer to a sorting device, to physically separate, and thereby purify particles of interest, based on their optical properties. Such process is called cell sorting, and the instrument is commonly termed a "cell sorter". A Cytometer is similar to a microscope, except that, instead of producing an image of the cell, Cytometry offers high-throughput, large-scale, automated quantification of specified optical parameters on a cell-by-cell basis. 
The Contractor must demonstrate the ability to meet all requirements for the solicitation. The objective is to provide Cytometers to be used by clinicians throughout the VA medical centers and facilities. The period of performance is for one (1) 12-month base period with two 12-month option periods.

2.     REQUIREMENT

This requirement will be IAW FAR clause 52.211-6,  Brand Name or Equal  which requires that the quoter indicate that each product that is being offered as an  equal  product to the FACSLyric System by BD Biosciences® Cytometers. For each equal product, the offeror must include a description reflecting the salient characteristics (SC) and level of quality that will satisfy the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics of the equal product(s) specified in the solicitation. The quoter must also clearly identify the item by brand name (if any) and make/model number. Finally, the quoter must include descriptive literature, such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the contracting officer, and clearly describe any modifications it plans to make to a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements.

Submit quotations to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Quotations must be submitted as specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, quotations must show-<br />(1) The solicitation number;<br />(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of quotations;<br />(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the quoter;<br />(4) A technical description of the items being quoted in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<DESC>Mod 1: Extended quote due date to align more closely with award of related Contracts. See solicitation text. Due date pushed to 15 Feb.<br />Addendum: It is expected that after final quotes are received that discussions will be opened with the low quote, and minor changes might be made to facilitate scheduling logistics. Award is expected to be made concurrent or after related Contracts in order to solidify timeframes.&nbsp;A delay in award should be expected.<br />*Specification documents are not posted. All vendors shall contact SMSgt Christopher Fisher for a copy of the floorplan and specifications.<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement is being issued as a request for quotation (RFQ) and constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-100. This combined synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a cascading small business set-aside. If no acceptable Small Business quotes are received, then other than Small Business responses will be considered. North American Industrial Classification Standard 238330 applies to this solicitation; business size standard is $15m.
<p>The Minnesota Air National Guard has a requirement for raised flooring in a new flight simulator facility to support equipment cable routing below the raised floor. See specification document.</p>
<p>*Please read this solicitation carefully*</p>
<p>Situation: Currently the 148FW is remodeling a site via an existing Construction Contractor (CC) which will eventually house specialized flight simulator equipment. Each step in the process is time sensitive. The area will be ready for flooring installation between February and June (exact timing to be determined), at which time the awardee of this solicitation (Flooring Contractor, FC) will be ready to install raised flooring in the area. The FC shall initially install the raised floor throughout the facility per the design spec, except in the vicinity of the exterior entry door where there shall be an uninterrupted level surface across the entire width of the exterior entry door. This area requires a temporary infill of the area that will ultimately be the fire-egress ramp, and this portion of the project will be referred to as "the temporary ramp infill." This temporary ramp infill requirement is necessary to create a wide "loading-dock" style area sufficient to allow a 3rd party Equipment Contractor (EC) to utilize the entire width of the exterior door to unload and stage equipment. The exact configuration of the temporary ramp infill in this area shall be such that the temporary floor surface matches the finished elevation of the rest of the raised floor, allows for the unimpeded use of pallet-jacks across any transitions, be of equal or greater load bearing capacity to the rest of the raised floor, be constructed so as to allow for removal after the 3rd party EC is finished, and be of a design and material to be proposed by the FC. The installation of the raised floor throughout the facility, and the temporary ramp infill near the exterior door, shall be referred to as "Phase 1" of the project. After Phase 1 of the project is complete, the FC will be allowed to depart the site. Phase 2 is the period of time during which the 3rd party EC will be installing flight simulator equipment throughout the facility; Phase 2 is not a part of this solicitation, and the FC is not expected to be present during Phase 2 of the project. Upon completion of Phase 2, the FC will be recalled to the project site to begin Phase 3. Phase 3 requires that the FC remove the temporary ramp infill, and proceed with any remaining steps to finish the fire-egress ramp portion of the floor, as well as install any required railings at the perimeter of the ramp. Once the temporary ramp infill has been removed, and all portions of the raised floor and egress ramp are determined to be complete (per design spec,) then Phase 3 will be complete (completing the contract resulting from this solicitation). Note that the FC will be responsible for removing any and all waste, to include the temporary ramp infill, from the project site prior to final completion.</p>
<p>Schedule of events:<br />1. Existing CC nears completion of area requiring flooring.<br />2. Government will contact FC with notice to proceed on Phase I and will provide dates which the area will become available.<br />3. CC finishes area. Government takes ownership.<br />4. Phase 1 work begins, FC immediately installs raised flooring and temporary ramp infill. <br />5. FC notifies government that Phase 1 is complete. <br />6. Phase 2 begins; EC will import and set up the simulator equipment inside the area.<br />7. Upon EC completion, Government will give FC a notice to proceed on Phase 3.<br />8. Phase 3 begins; FC will remove the temporary ramp infill, install/finish the fire-egress ramp and associated railings to complete this contract.</p>
<p>Specifications: Any deviation from the listed specifications must be approved by the Contracting Officer for quote to remain eligible for consideration. If a specification is too restrictive, please make the Contracting Officer aware as soon as possible. The specifications are not absolute, but the weight tolerances need to be sufficient to support the equipment which will be installed in the room. This is a major technical consideration. Any quote which the government receives will be considered to have the specifications releasable to the simulator equipment installation vendor.</p>
<p>This flooring requirement is being procured as flooring equipment with installation. Please contact Contracting Officer if you would like to schedule a site visit, although site visits might not be practical as the site is not constructed as of yet.</p>
<p>Be sure to submit/attach enough additional information to enable the Government to fully ascertain the specifications/capabilities of any products quoted.</p>
<p>Preparing and Submitting your Quote:<br />Response is encouraged to include past performance information: other military, commercial, and civilian companies with whom you have done business. Include country of manufacture for all items. Include feasible delivery dates.</p>
<p>Preferred CLIN structure:<br />CLIN0001: Phase 1, 1 EA<br />CLIN0002: Phase 3, 1 EA<br />CLIN0003: Manpower Reporting, 1 JB (see Manpower Reporting section)</p>
<p>All questions and quotes must be directed to 148 Contracting Officer via email at usaf.mn.148-fw.list.msc-personnel@mail.mil. Questions asked within 1 week of solicitation close will be answered at the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Please make quotes good for 30 days, if possible. Emailed quotes are preferred. Late quotes may be rejected at the Contracting Officer's discretion.</p>
<p>Evaluation: <br />The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the offer conforming to the solicitation which will be most advantageous to the Government. Quotes will be evaluated using price, technical, delivery (this is a time sensitive process.), and past performance. All solicitation specifications are not absolute and the 148FW will consider innovative solutions to this requirement. Quotes may be comparatively evaluated in compliance with FAR 13.106-2 (b) (3). Only the winning specifications will be shared with the third party equipment installation vendor, and this vendor will not participate in the evaluation. If the winning specifications are rejected by the equipment installer, the government reserves the right to either re-solicit or if changes are minor, work with the awardee to modify their quote.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO ISSUE ONE (1) CONTRACT BUT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONSIDER PARTIAL OR MULTIPLE AWARDS. If not already registered in SAM, go to WWW.SAM.GOV to register prior to submitting quote. At the time of evaluation of your quote, your company much have an active status in SAM.gov.</p>
<p>Electronic Documents: All electronic documents must NOT be "secured", "locked", or otherwise inaccessible. Submitter risks rejection if documents prove inhospitable to viewing and evaluation. Utilize standard Microsoft or Adobe formats, and net file size of all documents should be less than 10MB.</p>
<p>If an individual item of supply is valued over $5,000, contractor must comply with 252.211-7003 Item Unique Identification and Valuation. VIN, MEID, ESN, GIAI, and GRAI are considered equivalent of a UID.</p>

The expected contract will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Contract and will consist of one base year plus two option years.

The NAICS code is 332993. The Size Standard is 1500 employees. The PSC code is 1310. This solicitation is for non-commercial supplies. This requirement was previously synopsized under announcement number N00174-18-R-0099. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
<p>The Government intends to make a single award resulting from the solicitation to the responsible offeror whose submissions, which comply with the instructions and conform to the solicitation, will be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. Best value will be determined based on an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors for award. The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers: (FACTOR 1) Technical Capability; (FACTOR 2) Past Performance (see FAR 52.212-1(b)(10)); (FACTOR 3) Price and (FACTOR 4) Small Business Subcontracting Plan Goals. These factors are listed in descending order of importance. All non-cost factors, when combined, are more important than cost; however, cost becomes more of a deciding factor of importance when Offerors receive similar ratings for the other factors. Factors 1, 2, and 3 will be used for a tradeoff process. General statements, that the offeror can or will comply with the requirements, that standard procedures will be used, that well known techniques will be used, or that paraphrases the RFQ's specifications in whole or in part, will not constitute compliance with the mandatory requirements concerning the content of the technical proposal.<br /><br />Copies of solicitation N00174-19-R-0099 will NOT be emailed, faxed, mailed or provided in person. These types of requests WILL NOT BE ACKNOWLEDGED. This solicitation is being posted to Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at https://www.fbo.gov/.

<p>Any resultant contract will be DO Rated under the Defense Priorities and Allocations system (DPAS).</p>
<p>This procurement includes drawings or technical documents assigned a restricted distribution statement and an export control warning. To receive this controlled technical data, an Offeror must be currently certified through the United States/Canada Joint Certification Program.</p>
<p>To become certified for receipt of the technical documents, a U.S. Offeror must submit a completed DD Form 2345 to the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office. Canadian Offerors may submit either a completed DD Form 2345 or DSS-MAS 9379 for certification. In addition, a copy of the company's State/Provincial Business License, Incorporation Certificate, Sales Tax Identification Form or other documentation which verifies the legitimacy of the company must accompany all DD Form 2345s. Additional information on the Joint Certification Program and a checklist for completion of the DD Form 2345 is available at the following website: http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/. Offerors are encouraged to apply for certification as early as possible in order for processing to be completed in sufficient time to prepare a proposal before solicitation closing.<br /><br />The Contract Specialist must receive any and all questions concerning the RFP no later than 5 business days before the response date of the solicitation. No questions will be accepted after the close of the solicitation.

<DESC>C-ARCHITECT AND ENGINEERING SERVICES<br />"Small Business Set-Aside Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for Architect-Engineering (A-E) Services within the Northwestern Division (MEGA Phase B)"
<p>General Information<br /><br />Document Type: Synopsis for A-E Service Contracts<br /><br />Solicitation Number: W912DQ18R3000<br />Posted Date:</p>
<p>Original Response Date:</p>
<p>Current Response Date:</p>
<p>Classification Code: C - Architect and Engineering Service</p>
<p>1. Contract Information: The Northwestern Division (NWD) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement to acquire Architect-Engineer (A-E) Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste (HTRW)/Environmental Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for execution of its environmental mission. This contract acquisition is part of NWD's Phase B of the Multiple Environmental Government Acquisition (MEGA).</p>
<p>These regional A-E contract acquisitions will be conducted in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineers statute (40 USC Chapter 11), and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 236.6. The majority of the work will be located in NWD (including Kansas City, Omaha, and Seattle Districts), with the potential for work on EPA Region 2 projects.</p>
<p>In support of this effort, the Government intends to award contracts to three (3) Small Business firms sharing $12 million in total contract capacity. However, if the Contracting Officer determines during the selection process that fewer or more than three (3) contracts should be awarded, based on the selection criteria, the Contracting Officer has the discretion of adjusting that number, or awarding none at all.</p>
<p>This announcement is open to all Small Businesses. The period of performance for each contract will be five (5) years. It is anticipated that the contracts will be awarded not earlier than April 2018.</p>
<p>Task orders will be issued as the need arises during the contract ordering period. Task order assignments will be determined with consideration of each firm's specialized experience and technical competence, professional qualifications, past performance, capacity, and knowledge of locality. These task orders may be either firm fixed-price or cost reimbursable type orders. There is no limit on the value of individual task orders and the period of performance on individual task orders shall not exceed five (5) years.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 -- Engineering Services. For the purposes of this procurement a concern is considered a Small Business if its average annual gross receipts are $15 million or less. More than one contract may be awarded for the same scope of work. Under the Selection of Architects and Engineers statute, price competition is not allowed for A-E contracts.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the requirements, projects are completed in phases such as preliminary assessment, remedial investigation, feasibility study, and then design. The project scope will be reviewed to determine whether the requirement can be accomplished using a firm fixed-price task order or whether uncertainties will require the use of a cost reimbursable task order.</p>
<p>When the requirement is identified, the government will notify all contractors in the pool that an evaluation will be conducted. The notification will include whether the contractor's SF 330 will be used, or if the government requires unique experience or qualifications to be submitted for the task order evaluation. Specialized experience and technical competence, professional qualifications, past performance, capacity, and knowledge of locality will be considered for task orders to determine which firm is best qualified to accomplish the work.</p>
<p>The period of performance for task orders awarded under the IDCs will be determined based upon the work requirement (not to exceed five (5) years) and will be included in the task order solicitation and negotiated award documents. A Request for Price Proposal (RFPP) will be issued to the selected firm for each task order.</p>
<p>The Service Contract Labor Standards statute is applicable to this solicitation and resulting contracts and will be incorporated into same. Service wage rates will be determined based on the locality where the services will be performed.</p>
<p>Prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be eligible for contract award. In order to register in SAM, a firm must have a Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number from Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B). If a firm does not have a DUNS number, one can be requested by visiting D&amp;B at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Additionally, in accordance with FAR Part 22.1303, all firms must complete their VETS-4212 report. Information can be found at the Department of Labor website https://www.dol.gov/vets/vets4212.htm, or call the service center at 1-866-237-0275; you will be asked to provide your company name, employer identification number (EIN), and DUNS number.</p>
<p>2. Project Information: Firms must be capable of performing work on a wide variety of HTRW sites in a manner that complies with federal, state, and local regulations and laws, and within time frames required. At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the Prime/Joint Venture (JV) firm. It is anticipated that a majority of the work will be performed within NWD under the CERCLA regulatory framework. These contracts may be used to provide A-E services for EPA Region 2 projects.</p>
<p>Specific needs will be determined based upon project requirements as described in each task order. Project assignments will typically require performance on-site and in an office setting. Selected firms will work on a variety of hazardous waste and other environmental projects, including, but not limited to contaminated soil and groundwater, contaminated sediments, radioactive and mixed wastes, underground storage tanks and fueling systems, and habitat restoration and mitigation.</p>
<p>Assignments will include Preliminary Assessments, site investigations, subsurface exploration, chemical sampling, testing and analyses, hazard evaluations, feasibility and other engineering studies and reports, groundwater and other modeling, contaminant fate and transport analysis, human health and ecological risk assessments, Proposed Plans, Decision Documents, HTRW remedial designs, preparation of plans and specifications, cost estimating, value engineering screenings and studies, field inspections, verification of existing conditions, pilot studies, vapor intrusion studies, surveying and mapping, community relations, construction-phase services (engineering design during construction, checking design drawings), Five Year Reviews, archaeological investigations and mitigation, wetlands determination and mitigation studies, storm water design (including drainage studies and hydraulic modeling), evaluations of green technologies and energy conservation measures, and other related services.</p>
<p>3. Primary Selection Criteria: Selection of the firms will be based on the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance, first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion. Additional consideration will be given for experience and qualifications by the Prime or Joint Venture (JV) firms. Criteria A through E are primary criteria and will be evaluated for all offerors.</p>
<p>(A) Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm demonstrated for a broad range of CERCLA HTRW work performed under the CERCLA regulatory framework. Firms will be evaluated for experience and competence in areas 1 through 3 below, clearly demonstrated in the past five (5) years. The most highly qualified firms will have extensive experience in all of the following areas:</p>
<p>1. Remedial Investigations, Risk Assessments (human health and ecological), Feasibility Studies, development of UFP-QAPPs, execution of field investigations including soil and groundwater sampling, installation of monitoring wells, groundwater modeling, and Remedial Design. Experience with differing contaminants in various media including soil, groundwater, sediment, and bedrock, should be demonstrated. Experience providing A-E services for HTRW projects located within NWD should also be demonstrated. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section F of the SF 330.</p>
<p>2. Demonstrated quality management processes and procedures that result in high quality work products. The Prime/JV firm should demonstrate a strong understanding of quality management principles by describing quality management roles and responsibilities and organizational structure, and by documenting quality management process and procedures. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>3. Managing cost reimbursable contracts. The Prime/JV firm should demonstrate experience managing government cost reimbursable contracts as the prime including accounting systems, cost tracking, managing cost and schedule variances, cost/budget projections, and indirect rate adjustments. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>(B) Professional qualifications of a firm's staff and team consultants to be assigned to this contract. The education, professional registration, proposed job title, overall and relevant HTRW work performed under the CERCLA Regulatory Framework, longevity with the firm, and experience of key personnel will be considered. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel. The number of personnel is addressed under the capacity criterion below. Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications of their staff in these key disciplines, which are listed in descending order of importance. Responding firms shall submit resumes for each of the following key disciplines: (1) Project Management; (2) Hydrogeology / Geology; (3) Civil/Geotechnical Engineering; (4) Chemistry; (5) Environmental / Process Engineering; (6) Risk Assessment; and (7) Industrial Hygiene. A maximum of three (3) resumes for Project Manager, and a maximum of two (2) resumes for each of the other disciplines shall be submitted. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section E of the SF 330.</p>
<p><br />(C) Past performance on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, management/business relations, and compliance with performance schedules. The Contractor Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) is the primary source of information on past performance. CPARS will be queried by the Government for all firms submitting a SF 330. No submittals are required by the offerors for this criteria. Each project in Section F of the SF 330 shall include owner's contact information. If deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant team subcontractors may also be considered. The board may seek information on past performance from other sources, but is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm, if none is available from CPARS. When evaluating past performance, the board will consider the relevancy of performance evaluations on A-E services contracts to the proposed contract.</p>
<p>(D) Capacity: The board will consider available capacity of key disciplines identified above from the Prime/JV firm and its team consultants to perform work in the required time. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H and Part II of the SF330.</p>
<p>(E) Knowledge of the Locality: The board will evaluate a Prime/JV firm's knowledge and experience with geological features and the state/ local regulatory agencies. Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispersed geographic area, therefore, responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities to serve projects located throughout the USACE NWD. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Sections F and H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>4. Secondary Selection Criteria: The following secondary criterion will only be used as a tie-breaker among technically equal firms. The secondary criterion will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation. The secondary criterion is Volume of DoD A-E Contract Awards in the last 12 months. Responding firms should cite all contract numbers, task orders and modifications, award dates and total negotiated fees for any DoD A-E contract awarded within the past twelve (12) months. This information will assist in effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>5. Submittal Requirements: Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit one (1) original plus five (5) copies and one (1) CD or DVD with searchable Adobe PDF files of one SF 330 (current version can be found in the GSA Forms Library at GSA.gov) for the prime firm that includes all team consultants. Include the firm's DUNS number and CAGE codes in the SF 330, Part I, Sections B and C. A maximum of ten (10) projects for the proposed team, including joint ventures and teaming partners, shall be shown in Section F. For the ten (10) projects submitted in Section F of the SF 330, a "project" is defined as work performed at one site or at a single installation. An IDC contract is not a project. A project may contain multiple task orders or contracts if they are for multiple phases of the project at the same site or installation. Project descriptions shall clearly state extent of work performed by the team, extent of work completed, and dates of completion.</p>
<p>If the offeror provides a specific task order as its "project," it shall provide the base contract number(s) and the task order number(s) for reference purposes. If the offeror provides a site-specific contract as its "project," it shall provide the contract number for reference purposes.</p>
<p>Firms should include information regarding the Secondary Selection Criteria in Section H of the SF 330. The SF 330 shall have a total page limitation of 70 printed pages with Section H limited to ten (10) pages, and Part II is excluded from the 70 printed page limit. Double-sided sheets will count as two pages. Page sheets of 11 inches X 17 inches will be counted as two (2) pages if printed on one side, and four (4) pages if printed on both sides. For all SF 330 sections, use no smaller than 11 pt. font. Solicitation packages are not provided. This is not a request for proposal.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Africa Regional Team Leader is a member of the USAID Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Chief of FPD, and is based in Washington, D.C. OTI currently has five regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division: West Africa (AFR), Latin America, the Caribbean and East Africa (LACSEA), Asia, Middle East (ME), and Europe (EUR). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>Under this solicitation, the Regional Team Leader will be responsible for overseeing specific OTI country programs in the Sub-Saharan Africa regions, supervising program teams in Washington, D.C. and the field, and serving as the principle OTI interlocutor on all existing and forecasted programs in the region. This is a program-funded USPSC position that focuses the vast majority of its time on managing country programs. The Africa Regional Team Leader will insure that U.S. Government funds are spent wisely, in coordination with other key actors, and in a manner that reflects OTI standard practices and U.S. Government policy.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES - Please see Attachment 2 to this solicitation for information on AAPD No. 18-02.</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<br />&emsp;<br />ATTACHMENT 2</p>

<p>GP 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES (MAY 2018) (Pursuant to class deviation #M/OAA-DEV-AIDAR-18-3c)</p>
<p>USAID will provide Medevac services to the contractor and authorized dependents, through the Department of State's Bureau for Medical Services (MED), similar to those provided to U.S. Government employees in accordance with 16 FAM 300 Medical Travel. Medevac costs include travel and per diem, but do not include medical care costs. To be covered by the Medevac program, the contractor and authorized dependents must obtain and maintain international health insurance coverage that includes overseas hospitalization, and must provide proof of such insurance to the contracting officer prior to relocation abroad.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Asia Regional Team Leader is a member of the USAID Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Chief of FPD, and is based in Washington, D.C. OTI currently has five regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division: West Africa (AFR), Latin America, the Caribbean and East Africa (LACSEA), Asia, Middle East (ME), and Europe (EUR). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>Under this solicitation, the Regional Team Leader will be responsible for overseeing specific OTI country programs in Asia, supervising program teams in Washington, D.C. and the field, and serving as the principle OTI interlocutor on all existing and forecasted programs in the region. This is a program-funded USPSC position that focuses the vast majority of its time on managing country programs. The Asia Regional Team Leader will insure that U.S. Government funds are spent wisely, in coordination with other key actors, and in a manner that reflects OTI standard practices and U.S. Government policy.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES - Please see Attachment 2 to this solicitation for information on AAPD No. 18-02.</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<br />&emsp;<br />ATTACHMENT 2</p>
<p>Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Chapter 7. <br />USAID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR)</p>
<p>APPENDIX D - DIRECT USAID CONTRACTS WITH A U.S. CITIZEN OR A U.S. RESIDENT ALIEN FOR PERSONAL SERVICES ABROAD</p>
<p>GP 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES (MAY 2018) (Pursuant to class deviation #M/OAA-DEV-AIDAR-18-3c)</p>
<p>USAID will provide Medevac services to the contractor and authorized dependents, through the Department of State's Bureau for Medical Services (MED), similar to those provided to U.S. Government employees in accordance with 16 FAM 300 Medical Travel. Medevac costs include travel and per diem, but do not include medical care costs. To be covered by the Medevac program, the contractor and authorized dependents must obtain and maintain international health insurance coverage that includes overseas hospitalization, and must provide proof of such insurance to the contracting officer prior to relocation abroad.</p>

<p>1. Describe your company's ability to manufacture and deliver CTS devices. If known, provide any documentation and/or declarations of commerciality of the CTS. The CTS shall be able to stimulate and read power output in a 10-250 foot region for UV and multi-color IR. <br /><br />2. Describe whether your company will require any portion of the work to manufacture and sustain the CTS to be subcontracted. Specify whom you anticipate contracting with and what percentage of the effort each subcontractor will perform. Specify the extent to which your firm believes small disadvantaged businesses, small businesses or other categories of businesses discussed in FAR Part 19 would be utilized in meeting the requirements specified herein. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming should be provided.<br /><br />3. Describe your company's ability to manage the configuration of the CTS.<br /><br />4. Describe your company's ability to manage CTS Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages challenges throughout the system's life cycle.<br /><br />5. Describe your company's ability to establish an organic depot-level repair capability for the CTS. In addition, describe your company's ability to provide access to depot-level maintenance source data. Source Data must include, but is not limited to: Skilled personnel requirements, Training and Certifications, Engineering data and drawings, Technical manuals and documentation, Repair procedures, Test requirements, Special and common support/test equipment, Special and common tools, Provisioning data, Facility requirements, repair process flows, and verification of CTS and CTS maintenance procedures. The USG cannot provide certain types of data to support this effort; your company must be able to obtain this data.</p>
<p>6. Describe your company's experience and ability to identify existing and potential depot-level maintenance capabilities for the CTS, the CTS's components, and subcomponents.</p>
<p>7. Describe your company's experience and ability to identify specialized skill sets, conduct training to meet these skill sets, and enable the Government to obtain required certifications to perform depot-level repairs of the CTS.</p>
<p>8. Describe your company's experience and ability to identify, obtain, and provide special and common support/test equipment and tools to perform depot-level repairs of the CTS.</p>
<p>9. Describe your company's experience and ability to identify and provide provisioning data for the CTS depot-level maintenance. Provisioning is defined as the process of determining and acquiring the range and quantity of support items. This includes but is not limited to: spares, consumables, bulk materiel, tools, and test equipment necessary to operate and maintain a system.</p>
<p>10. Describe your company's experience and ability to identify and deliver technical manuals and other documentation necessary to operate and maintain organic depot-level maintenance operations for the CTS.</p>
<p>11. Describes your company's ability to stimulate the LAIRCM system's Hostile Fire Indication (HFI) functionality. If not, describe your company's ability to integrate HFI testing capability into the CTS to support potential future requirements.</p>
<p>12. Describe your company's ability to stimulate the LAIRCM system's laser warning.</p>
<p>13. Describe your company's ability to provide a prototype device to demonstrate its capability.</p>
<p>The capability package shall be limited to twenty (20) double-spaced, minimum ten (10) point font, single-sided pages.</p>
<p>Respondents who submit a capability package in response to this notice shall identify prior contracts (by contract number and issuing office) and commercial and Government points of contact (preferably the buyer or contracting officer) related to these efforts.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code to be used for this SSS is 336413 with a size standard of 1,250 employees. Firms responding should indicate their size in relation to this size standard, and also indicate socio-economic status (SB, 8(a), VOSB, SDVOSB, WOSB, EDWOSB, and/or HUBZone). Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. Capability responses will be assessed and the data will be used to assist the Government in determining the acquisition strategy, including Small Business Set Aside (SBSA), sole source, or full and open, for any potential subsequent action. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 10.001, market research results will be used to determine whether FAR Part 19 criteria are met for a SBSA or further socio-economic set aside. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a SBSA is that small business prime contractors meet the requirements set forth in compliance with FAR 52.219-14, Limitation of Subcontract. Responses from small businesses, therefore, need to include rationale as to how compliance with FAR 52.219-14 will be achieved. Also, the rules governing affiliation and ostensible subcontracting apply when determining size, as does the non-manufacturer rule. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract.</p>
<p>If this effort is not a set-aside for small business, a small business utilization requirement will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable requirement for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.<br /><br />Submission of Proprietary Information Caution: The USG appreciates that interested respondents may not be able to respond to this market research without disclosing information deemed "proprietary." Data submitted in response to this market research will be distributed and discussed within the Government. Respondents are responsible for clearly marking submitted information with appropriate restrictive markings. Analyses of responses may require disclosure of responses to Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) support contractor personnel. All members of the Government/Contractor team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, USG members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All support contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts.</p>
<p>Responses may be submitted electronically to the following email address: brett.everett@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "Sources Sought - LAIRCM CTS." If this subject line is not included, the email may not get through email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachments. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc. or .xls documents are attached to your email; all other attachments may be deleted.</p>
<p>Responses may also be submitted via mail to: AFLCMC/WNYK, 2275 D Street, Bldg. 16, Room 0103, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7222, ATTN: Brett Everett.</p>
<p>Responses must be received no later than 12:00 p.m.,&nbsp;fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this announcement (25 Jan 19). If necessary, the Government may elect to contact interested parties for further clarifications or site visits.</p>

STATEMENT OF TASK/SCOPE OF WORK
GENERAL:

A/E to provide services for preparation of design documents and construction period services for  Correct Safety, Compliance, and FCA Deficiencies in Building 2 with Kitchen, Canteen, and Food Service Renovation , Project # 557-16-107. 

The design must, at a minimum, be in accordance with all applicable codes (NFPA, JCAHO, UBC, and EPA) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) publications (Master Construction Specifications, Construction Standards, etc.).

If any asbestos or lead paint abatement should become necessary, the design shall be done by a Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH).  The design and as-built documents shall bear the CIH name.  All asbestos and lead paint abatement design shall incorporate the latest requirements of VA, federal, state, and local authority having jurisdiction.

The project shall be designed to attempt to achieve an energy consumption level that is at least 30% below the level achieved under ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004 (if life-cycle cost effective).  Use Appendix G of ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004 to document the energy savings achieved by the design. Should a 30% reduction in energy consumption savings prove to be unattainable per life-cycle cost analysis, A/E shall evaluate alternative designs at 5% successive decrements in order to identify the most energy-efficient design that is life-cycle cost effective.  A Savings-to-Investment Ratio worksheet shall be provided with each design submittal to show energy savings.

The following parameters shall be used for performing the analysis:

20-year life-cycle period for system comparison
Use Public domain programs such as TRACE, E-CUBE, Carrier E20-II, Energy Plus, etc.
3% Discount Factor

All drawings and specifications shall be submitted by A/E to VA on computer disc at the completion of the project.

One additional disk containing electronic copies of all drawings in portable document format (.pdf) shall be submitted for the Contracting Officer s use.

Project shall be designed to meet the prescribed VA Construction Budget, with sufficient Deductions to achieve a 10% reduction from that Budget.  Should bids received come in over budget even after taking the Bid Deducts into account, it will be the A/E s responsibility to redesign the project to achieve the VA Construction Budget.

SCOPE OF WORK:

The Working Drawings and Specifications for this design shall include, but not be limited to, areas of alterations as described in this Scope of Work. Provide all labor, materials, tools, equipment, and design services necessary to achieve the Carl Vinson VA Medical Center project,  Correct Safety, Compliance, and FCA Deficiencies in Building 2 with Kitchen, Canteen, and Food Service Renovation , Project #557-16.107.

This project will engage an Architectural/Engineering firm to provide Schematic Design, Design Development, Contract Drawings, Specifications, Construction Cost Estimates, and Construction Period Services.

PROJECT SCOPE:  This project will renovate the kitchen, dining, canteen, and food preparation areas for the facility, providing a more modern and appealing kitchen and eating area.  These areas are used to serve patients, visitors, and employees.  This project will also allow for the separation of Dining service, which supplies meals to patients, from the Canteen Service, which supplies food to visitors and staff, into two separate and distinct prep and kitchen areas.  This project will allow for the separation of these two services by providing two kitchens, one for inpatients through Dining and Nutrition and one for employees and visitors through the Veterans Canteen Service.  It is expected that much of the equipment will also need updating during this project.  An additional concern to be remedied in this project is the path of materials received via the main loading dock for the facility, which is currently directly through the kitchen.  It is the desire of the facility to create a distinct path for items being unloaded and transported through the hospital, to prevent transport through the kitchen.  Total area being renovated is 34,012 square feet. Project will design full renovation of 34,012 square feet.  During the renovation, the three deficiencies need to be corrected as well.

Three Facility Condition Assessment (FCA) Deficiencies shall be mitigated by this project:

FCA Record Number: 121147, Building Number: 2, System: Architectural, Subsystem: Interior Finishes, Condition: D, Description: Replace the flooring in the kitchen where large cracks have occurred between rooms 214 and CR-23.

The kitchen area is in poor condition and is due to be renovated.

FCA Record Number: 266182, Building Number: 2, System: Architectural, Subsystem: Fixed Equipment, Condition: D, Description: -The cook/chill units are in poor condition and are due to be replaced. 

FCA Record Number: 121136, Building Number: 2, System: Architectural, Subsystem: Fixed Equipment, Condition: D, Description: -The display refrigerator at the food service line and the disposal unit in the scullery are beyond useful life and have failed and are due to be replaced.

HVAC and refrigeration/freezer systems shall be checked for useful life and replaced and/or upgraded as required.

During construction, there should be no more than 4-hour downtime of any utility system, unless approved well in advanced by the Contracting Officer s Representative (COR).  Phasing of the work may well be required to comply with this requirement, and should be taken into account in the design.

Design shall be in accordance with all VA Design Guides (VA OIT Design Guide) FISI checklist, VA Handbook 6500, BICSI Telecommunications Distribution Methods Manual, EIA/TIA standards, et. and ASHRAE requirements.

A/E work shall include providing cost estimates, performing research and design analysis, generating Design Documents of sufficient quality and quantity to allow the VA to advertise for bid, assist with bid opening and review, and provide construction period services.

Construction period services shall consist of A/E site visits, interim inspections, final inspection, submittal reviews, response(s) to Contractor & VA inquiries, and development of as-built drawings at project s completion.

NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE. ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EITHER MAILED, FAXED OR EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING SPECIALIST.  CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW.

This is a market survey for information and comments from industry that will aid in the formation of an acquisition strategy for the acquisition of Extron branded or equivalent components for the technical refresh of the Detroit area video wall in support of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The draft requirements are identified in the attached Statement of Work (SOW).

At this time, the Extron brand is the only brand known that will suffice for the requirements of this acquisition.

The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only. This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey. Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor’s expense.

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest, capabilities, and rough orders of magnitude (cost estimates) from businesses interested in and capable of providing the required Extron brand or equivalent components per the Statement of Work (SOW). Respondents to this Market Survey are encouraged to provide comments regarding the government’s approach to this requirement.

This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the potential acquisition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes and size standards for this effort:

NAICS – 334310, Audio and Video Equipment Manufacturing
Size Standard – 750 Employees

Interested firms are required to submit a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.

The FAA requires interested vendors to address the requirements in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW). This document is provided for feedback and comments.

Each vendor should include the following information along with their submission:

1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:

- Type of supplies and services that are Extron branded or similar provided by your firm (if an alternative to Extron brand, please send information regarding the alternative (i.e.: brand, model / part numbers, specifications, how the item is similar, etc.)

- Size and type of Extron / alternative brand supplies provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance)

- Number of years in business

2. Clearly state whether or not you can provide all of the types of supplies listed in the draft SOW.

3. Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.

4. Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) or budgetary estimate for the items described in the draft SOW.

All responses to this market survey must be received by 5:00 p.m. Central Time (Oklahoma Time) on January 18, 2018.

The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following:

Email: bill.white@faa.gov

If email is your method of submission, please include "MARKET SURVEY RESPONSE: Detroit Area Video Wall Tech Refresh” in the subject line of your email.

<p>This limited source increase in capacity of contract ceiling ensures continued execution of increased customer demolition requirements and execution of unforeseen critical demolition requirements at Tyndall Air Force Base necessitated by a catastrophic hurricane.</p>
<p>The contractors shall be responsible for providing and supporting planning, coordination, and execution of building and facility removal/demolition, including facility abatement and hazardous material removal, demolition, debris management and disposition, and site restoration and cleanup at Government facilities in the continental United States (CONUS) and Alaska and Hawaii. This is not a formal solicitation or request for proposal. This synopsis of intent is to give notice of the Government's intent to make limited source modifications to existing contracts.</p>
<p>In the near future, CEHNC is planning an acquisition to solicit and award multiple indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts to provide commercial demolition related services under North American Industrial Classification System Code 238910. Work requirements will be defined in specific Task Order Performance Work Statements (PWS) under a basic contract PWS. Services will include the planning, coordination, and execution of building and facility removal/demolition. Major aspects of the field work include, but are not limited to, facility abatement and hazardous material removal, demolition, debris management and disposition, and site restoration and cleanup. The program is estimated at $95,000,000 per region with five regions.</p>
<p>Subsequent acquisition information related to the upcoming new follow on procurement may be found on the FedBizOpps website (https://www.fbo.gov) under Solicitation Number W912DY-18-R-0063.</p>
