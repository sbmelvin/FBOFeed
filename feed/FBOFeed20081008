<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for continued support of the Engineering, Science andTechnical Services (ESTS) contract which provides a wide range of engineering, scienceand technical support services to various programs and projects, including Ares I (UpperStage, First Stage, Flight Integration Test, Upper Stage Engine, Vehicle Integration,etc.), Shuttle Propulsion, International Space Station, Orion/Launch Abort System, AresV, and more. NASA/MSFC intends to increase the current contract ceiling by $250 million, from $542.5million to $792.5 million.  At this time, there is no intention to extend the period ofperformance of the current contract (October 15, 2005 through October 14, 2010), and nonew noncompetitive contract instrument will be awarded with approval of this action.  Thecontract will be modified to increase the ceiling value.  Without approval of thisaction, the current contract ceiling will be expended in the July 2009 timeframe, well inadvance of the current contractual end date, and contract performance would have to stopat that time.  The ceiling increase for the ESTS contract will provide the highly specializedengineering and related services in support of Ares, Shuttle, and other Constellationrequirements. Jacobs Technology has been the support contractor providing criticalengineering and related skills to the MSFC since initiation of the Ares project in July2005.  As a result, Jacobs Technology has developed within their management staff aunique knowledge and understanding of requirements, operations, and policies andprocesses across the various elements of the Ares project and for other Constellationprogram elements. Use of Jacobs Technology existing and proven capabilities will permitthe timely execution of significant tasks that are necessary for achieving theAres/Constellation milestones, including the critical design milestones for Upper Stageand Vehicle Integration. A re-competition of the ESTS contract prior to the substantialcompletion of these critical Ares milestones would introduce considerableattrition-related schedule risks to the Ares Project.  No other source is capable ofsupporting the Ares project with required engineering skills without substantial risk ofunacceptable delays to NASAs requirement to deliver into service a Crew ExplorationVehicle to replace Shuttle.This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority forU.S.C. 2304(c)(1), for the acquisition of supplies and services from only one responsiblesource and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Inaccordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), services may be deemed to be available only fromthe original source for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it islikely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfillingthe agencys requirements.  FAR 6-302-1(b)(1)(ii) provides that use of this authority maybe appropriate in a situation when unique services are available from only one or alimited number of sources. Pursuant to NFS 1804.570, this proposed contract action will be published on the NASAAcquisition Internet Service (NAIS) and pursuant to FAR 5.201; this proposed contractaction will be synopsized in the Federal Business Opportunities. There have been nowritten expressions of interest in this acquisition action to date.  However, if any arereceived as a result of the NAIS publication or the Federal Business Opportunitiessynopsis, they will be appropriately disposition and documented by addendum to thisdocument.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon October 22, 2008. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely fordetermining whether to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determinationby the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitionbasis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of thegovernment.

<DESC>The intent of this notice is to determine if any other qualifiedsources exist.  In accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, the USEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) at Research Triangle Park (RTP),North Carolina intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with TourAndover Controls (TAC) Americas, 1650 West Crosby Road, Carrollton TX75006.  The performance period will consist of one base year with fouradditional options years, for a possible period of five years.  TheNorth American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for thisacquisition is 238210, Electrical Contractors and Other WiringInstallation (which includes building automation system installation),with a small business size standard of $14M.  
The EPA believes TAC Americas is the only source capable of performancebecause of the proprietary nature of the existing equipment/systemsinstalled.  There are three types of Building Automation Systems (BAS)used at RTP: Andover Infinity & Continuum (BAS from TAC), TAC iNet SEVEN(a legacy BAS from TAC), and TAC Net Vista (a new BAS from TAC whichwill eventually absorb the legacy iNet system).  These systems do notcommunicate with each other and are not capable of connecting to othersystems or computers.  For example, the system which controls theheating, lighting, water, and air conditioning in the buildings do notuse industry standard network switching technology, but uses proprietarytechnology; a design peculiar to one company.  
Under this procurement, the EPA will issue specific requirements anddeliverables through Task Orders and Delivery Orders.  Based on the Taskor Delivery Order, the contractor shall provide analysis services,repair services, product upgrades, product replacement, and acombination of products and services to expand existing facilitycontrols systems to meet new requirements for the TAC proprietary BAS atthe RTP campus and outlying buildings.  
Any interested firms who believe they can fulfill the requirementsshould submit a capabilities package fully demonstrating theircapabilities, qualifications and expertise related to this requirement(NTE 10 pages) no later than 15 days from the date of this announcementelectronically to lominack.william@epa.gov.  Capabilities packages willbe used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conductthis procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination not to competethis procurement based on response to this notice is solely within thediscretion of the Government.  This notice of intent is not a requestfor proposal.  This is for informational and planning purposes only andis not to be construed as a commitment by the government. This is not asolicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awardedfrom this announcement.  
Any information submitted to this notice of intent is voluntary.Reimbursement will not be made for any costs associated with providinginformation in response to this announcement. Any questions in relationto this notice of intent must be submitted in writing via email tolominack.william@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Department of State intends to negotiate a sole source contract with ChoicePoint Business & Government Services, Inc located at 1410 Spring Hill Road, Suite 400, McLean, VA 22102 for access to databases used for criminal and civil investigation, fraud investigation processing services and asset verification as well as other services. The base period of the contract will be one year with four option years. The authority for this action is FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The justifications for using this authority are:  a)  Only ChoicePoint is in a position to meet the above requirements without substantial and unacceptable delays for replacement of the software already installed at DoS facilities, and/or payment of development costs to meet the current level of functionality are prohibited.  It is estimated that a minimum of one years development time would be required to replicate the current systems functionality.  In addition, the existing functionality that would otherwise be developed during this timeframe would be delayed.  Additionally, if it were determined that the additional costs of development were acceptable, the delays in deployment are not acceptable because of significant security concerns that are being addressed by DoS.   b)  The software that is at the core of the systems capability is proprietary and no third party access to maintenance is permitted.  These capabilities of providing access to numerous investigative databases to domestic and overseas offices have been demonstrated by ChoicePoint.  This demonstrated existing capability substantially reduces the technical risk associated with the proposed acquisition approach.  c)  The proposed solution minimizes costs by leveraging the State Departments current investment in this critical investigative tool thus obviating the need to standardize by globally replacing one vendors equipment with another.

This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to the requirement by October 23, 2008. All responses from responsible sources will be considered. Responses must include sufficient documentation to allow this office to evaluate the possibility of your firm to submit a valid proposal. The determination to open competition based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government. If a solicitation is issued, no additional synopsis will be published. All responses must be submitted in writing within 15 calendar days of publication of this notice. If your company has the capability to provide a proposal on this procurement action, please send email notification to daviespa@state.gov no later than 10 a.m. Thursday, 23 October 2008.  Please provide the full company name, point of contact, telephone number, and email address.  No phone calls will be accepted and voice mail messages will neither be acknowledged nor returned.

Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Cold Storage Needs for Palm Dates Technical Assistance.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a technical assistance for Cold Storage Needs for Palm Dates.

The agricultural sector is predominant in Morocco; almost half of the active population is employed in this sector and it contributes around 13% to the GDP.  Moroccan agricultural production consists of cereals, fruits and vegetables.  High quality agricultural production, including olives and olive oil, is usually exported to Europe.  Currently, annual production of date palms in Morocco is estimated at 85,000 tons, of which nearly 30% spoils before it reaches its markets due to inadequate storage and transportation infrastructure.

Recognizing the important role of agriculture in the Moroccan economy, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has committed $300.9 million USD to stimulate growth in the agricultural sector and reduce volatility of agricultural production through the Fruit Tree Productivity Project.  The Fruit Tree Productivity Project will focus on date, figs, almond and olive tree production.  Furthermore, it will support the upgrading of existing small-scale irrigation infrastructure and the intensification and rehabilitation of existing date tree cultivation in irrigated oasis perimeters (approximately 16,000 ha within perimeters covering 23,000 ha).  The objective is to increase the efficiency of water use and other crop practices to enhance the yield and profitability of date production in the target areas.  

Although the MCC compact activities address the horticultural and irrigation issues, there is a need for further support in the marketing and agribusiness components of the date palm sector in Morocco.  Specifically, there is a need for assistance to identify ways to preserve the quality of production and improve the values of the produced crops.  This will have significant impacts on the income levels of farmers, which is the overall broad objective of the MCC compact.  

An efficient Cold Chain system is an important component of Morocco's agricultural sector and is vital for the country's economic development.  Morocco currently imports dates, mainly from Tunisia, to supplement its local production to meet domestic demand.  Morocco has a large potential to increase date production and one of its greatest barriers is the failure to prevent spoilage.  The implementation of a cold chain system and refrigerated facilities would enhance Moroccos ability to increase the value of high quality date products.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Maritime Fishing has identified this project as a priority as it would reduce post-harvest losses and improve farmers incomes.  

The technologies and practices to be identified in the study are those that would allow the storage of date palms for prolonged periods of time (up to 11 months), to enable producers to store their crops until the Holy Month of Ramadan of the following year, which is the season of peak demand for dates in Morocco and the Islamic World. Demand is expected to continue to increase, and so the need for cold storage facilities and infrastructure will also continue to grow. 

The study will also identify the optimal institutional arrangements for the implementation of the needed cold storage facilities, and explore a number of arrangements including public private partnerships (e.g., concessions) and others.  In addition, the project will include a training component targeting producers and producer associations on the importance of cold storage.  The study will also focus on showing the substantial return on investment that expenditures on cold chain storage will bring, due to to producers abilities to produce a better quality of fruit, and to preserve the fruit until the peak demand season.  Finally, the study will address replicability with other crops in the future.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $531,810 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. In order to meet the total requirements of the Region a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items within a product category) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs' needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. The product category includes ECG monitoring electrodes and resting EKG electrodes for adult, pediatric and neonatal patients in various styles (snap, tab, wired, unwired, chest, back, limb, round, square, radiotranslucent and any other types currently available on the market) and with various adhesives (standard, gel, diaphoretic and any other types currently available on the market) and defibrillator pads for adult, pediatric and neonatal patients that are multipurpose and have translucent qualities. The entire category of Electrodes and Defibrillator Pads has an annual demand of over $130,000.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.</p>
<p>The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit's (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory. The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.</p>
<p>The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.</p>
<p>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCP's Prime vendor program please access our web site at: https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is December 2008. The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.</p>

<p>This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer. We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.</p>
<p>D. Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.<br />Vendors will be required to provide detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and product literature. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor. All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.</p>
<p>The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate: (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor's responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor's information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Criteria<br />1. Your company must manufacture and/or distribute a complete line of electrodes/defibrillator pads. At a minimum, the line must include ECG monitoring electrodes and resting EKG electrodes for adult, pediatric and neonatal patients in various styles (snap, tab, wired, unwired, chest, back, limb, round, square, radiotranslucent and any other types currently available on the market) and with various adhesives (standard, gel, diaphoretic and any other types currently available on the market) and defibrillator pads for adult, pediatric and neonatal patients that are multipurpose and have translucent qualities to meet the needs of the facilities.<br />2. Provide the brand(s) under which your company manufactures or distributes your products.<br />3. Provide the size for each type of product, the type of conductive material, whether creams or gels are required for operation, is it suitable for the field setting, how the product is packaged to avoid the adhesive from drying out once the package is opened and how the sizes are identified.<br />4. Your electrodes/defibrillator pads must be packaged in quantities that service departments that are large users as well as small users for purposes such as crash carts.<br />5. Your electrodes/defibrillator pads must meet federal standards (FDA and AAMI). Please provide documentation stating that they meet the standards.<br />6. Your electrodes/defibrillator pads must be used with any manufacturer's equipment.<br />7. Your electrodes/defibrillator pads must be used for both short and long-term applications.<br />8. Your electrodes/defibrillator pads must be used for adult, pediatric, and neonatal populations.<br />9. Due to the increasing number of latex sensitive beneficiaries in our health system, our region requires latex-free versions of products in this product line where available. Additionally, products must be clearly labeled as latex free.<br />10. Your products must be available through the Prime Vendor, Cardinal Health or you will be disqualified from the standardization process. Please acknowledge and identify that you have such an agreement with Cardinal Health.<br />11. Your company must have a DAPA number for this product line or you will be disqualified from the standardization process. Please provide the DAPA number for this product line.<br />12. Your company must offer volume discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA. Vendors that fail to offer a discount off the DAPA price will be disqualified.<br />13. Educational tools or materials in the form of written, audio and/or visual must be provided for this product line. Please state how your company will meet this requirement.<br />14.

Please provide any history of backorders, recalls, and/or adverse events for this product line stating dates and duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors should put their best foot forward, that is, provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these situations and any relief or resolution which may have been provided since there will be no further opportunity to explain these incidents. If your company has not had any of the above, so state.</p>
<p>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. The TPRB will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples. Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 5PM local time, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.</p>
<p>The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree and 5 = Strongly Agree. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The clinical evaluation will be conducted in a clinical setting. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the "break", in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.</p>
<p>A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Criteria<br />1. Electrode/defibrillator pad packaging allows for simple and quick electrode application and prevention of the adhesive from drying out.<br />a. Clinicians require packaging that allows for easy opening and long term storage to prevent the electrodes/defibrillator pads from drying out and for handling of electrodes/defibrillator pads for quick application and lead attachment leading to timely assessment of patient status and prevention of lead malfunction.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of electrodes/defibrillator pads on at least (3) patients.<br />c. Evaluator will open/remove electrode from packaging, apply to patient skin and attach wire leads (unless pre-wired), and will observe for ease of application process. Evaluator will also read the label packaging to assess if the packaging prevents the electrode from drying out after the package is opened.</p>
<p>2. Electrode/defibrillator pad adhesive backing (or attachment strap for limb lead electrodes/defibrillator pads) assures full skin contact through use.<br />a. Clinicians require that the electrodes/defibrillator pads remain in full contact with skin to assure a constant and accurate electronic signal to monitor/record patient status.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of electrodes/defibrillator pads on at least (3) patients.<br />c. After applying the electrode to patients' skin, the evaluator will gently pull/tug on connecting lead wire and will observe for quality of electrode adhesive contact (or limb lead attachment strap) with skin.</p>
<p>3. Electrode-lead/defibrillator pad wire connection remains intact through use.<br />a. Clinicians require that the electrode-lead wire remain in constant connection to assure a constant and accurate electronic signal to monitor/record patient status.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of electrodes/defibrillator pads on at least (3) patients.<br />c. After applying the electrode to patients' skin and attaching lead wires (unless pre-wired), the evaluator will gently pull/tug on connecting lead wire (including pre-wired electrodes/defibrillator pads) and will observe for the quality of the electrode-lead wire connection.</p>
<p>4. Electrodes/defibrillator pads remain in full contact with dry as well as moist skin.<br />a. Clinicians require that electrodes/defibrillator pads remain in full contact with skin under all circumstances including when patient is diaphoretic (sweating) due to changes in physical status.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of electrodes/defibrillator pads on at least (3) patients.<br />c. After applying electrode to patients' skin, evaluator will observe the quality of electrode-skin contact when skin moisture is present (if patient's skin is dry, moisture is added by water spray mist or moistened towel applied to the patient' skin around area of electrode).</p>
<p>5. Electrode/defibrillator pad adhesive surface is non-irritating/damaging to the skin during use or during removal.<br />a. Clinicians require that the electrode does not cause skin breakdown during use or skin breakdown upon electrode removal from skin.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of electrodes/defibrillator pads on at least (3) patients.<br />c. Evaluator will observe the condition of the patient skin during electrode removal and after electrode removal for compromise too skin integrity.</p>
<p>Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process. All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region. The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) years (24 months) with possible three (3) 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor. The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements. Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.</p>

<DESC><p>A. General Information
<p>Southwest Region seeks approval to standardize Warming Blankets &amp; Units for patient temperature management in the prevention of hypothermia for its Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical facilities in California. Standardization action for this product line represents a new initiative for this Region. It is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. This product line includes warming units that utilize warm air for heating and these items in the following sizes: adult upper body approximately 72 in. by 24 in.; adult lower body approximately 60 in. by 36 in.; adult full body blanket at least 84 in. by 36 in.; and pediatric full body blanket approx. 36 in by 33 in. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes listed.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.</p>

<p>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. The TPRB will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples. Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 5PM local time, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.</p>

Clinicians require the warming unit is easy to set up for normal operation and in an emergency leading to timely care of the patient and avoidance of further hypothermic damage.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (3) times.<br />c. Evaluator will simulate an emergency and set up the warming unit as quickly as possible by plugging in the unit and turning it on, choosing the settings and adjusting alarms to determine the ease of set up and operation.</p>
<p>2. The warming unit screen is easy to read.<br />a. Clinicians require the screen be visually clear with appropriate contrast for quick reference and safe operation.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (3) times.<br />c. Evaluator will turn on the warming unit, wait until the screen is on and view the screen for easy readability up close and from a distance of at least (5) feet.</p>
<p>3. The warming unit's alarm is visible and audible and the cause(s) of the alarm is (are) easily identifiable<br />a. Clinicians require the warming unit's alarm be both visible and audible as well as seeing what the cause is to allow for timely intervention and maintain the safety of the patient.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (3) times.<br />c.

<p>4. The warming blanket packaging allows for simple and quick application.<br />a. Clinicians require packaging that allows for easy opening and handling of the warming blanket for quick application and attachment to the warming unit for timely implementation to the patient.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (3) times.<br />c. Evaluator will open/remove warming blanket from the packaging, apply to patient and attach hose from warming unit and will observe for ease of application process.</p>
<p>5. The warming blanket can be removed from the patient easily.<br />a. Clinicians require the blanket not be difficult to remove to avoid stress to the patient and extended heating time.<br />b.

<p>8. The warming unit is easy to turn off, unplug and stow away.<br />a. Clinicians require the warming unit be easy to power off and store after normal use in a timely manner and without potential injury to the clinicians.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (3) times.<br />c. Evaluator will power off, unplug and store the warming unit to determine the ease of stowing it away.</p>
<p>Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process. All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region. The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor. The impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement for information purposes only (FAR 52.215-3). No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. Be advised that this request does not constitute an obligation upon the Government to pursue any follow-on contract action, in part or whole, with current or potential vendors. The purpose of this synopsis is to access the markets capability and to determine acquisition strategy and small business goal attainment.

Background.  

Because WPS is fielded worldwide and because it involves military operations or reserve training it must be supported 24 hours a day, seven (7) days a week.  Service Calls (SC) are received by a centralized SDDC Hotline (Tier 1).  SCs requiring more in-depth assistance will be referred to the WPS Tier 2 Hotline where a determination is made whether the SC has to be elevated to Tier 3 (Government representative) which in turn may turn the SC over to software developer support (Tier 4). When passed to the developer a Problem Report (PR) is generated.  Under this PWS the contractor will be responsible for only Tier 4 referred inquiries (PRs).  The contractors functions must include; assisting in requirements definition, systems analysis, programming support, testing, trouble shooting, and configuration management of WPS software baselines for the Terminal Level, and WPS-W configurations; and 24 hours/seven (7) days a week on-call technical and software engineering support.  The contractor shall provide software maintenance for WPS users and system documentation support covering technical and functional changes to the software.

Since WPS is a DoD-designated migration system, the contractor shall be aware of all DoD/DISA and Joint Transportation CIM Center (JTCC) requirements for Defense Information Infrastructure/Common Operating Environment (DII/COE), and data standards and will incorporate them where possible, consistent with the provisions of an anticipated PWS.

WPS is in the sunset phase of its system life, and is in the process of being replaced by the Air Mobility Commands (AMC) Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES).  By the end of the first expected option period of a PWS, WPS is expected to be fully replaced and should no longer exist as an operational system.

The contractor shall ensure the continuity of service with the anticipation of not more than 5 working days to implement its transition plan for all affected activities to preclude any adverse impact on the mission. 

Scope

This Performance Work Statement (PWS) is for the software maintenance support for the WPS, including the Windows based Carryaway version (WPS-W) in support of the Ocean Cargo Systems Branch of the Automated Transportation Systems Division.  A separate task order, to be awarded to another contractor, shall include Independent Validation and Verification (IV&V). 

DELIVERABLES.

Task 1: Program Management Plan and Monthly PMSR.

Task 2: Development and delivery of Emergency and Urgent software changes for the applications in Appendix 1.  This will include response to referred helpdesk calls.

Performance Standard: Emergency software changes are to be completed through unit testing within 24 hours, unless otherwise approved in writing by the COR.  Urgent software changes are to be completed within three (3) calendar days through unit testing unless otherwise approved in writing by the COR.

Base Period:  

WPS Terminal  Two (2) Emergency and three (3) Urgent software changes
WPS-W  Two (2) Emergency and three (3) Urgent software changes

Option 1 Period: 

WPS Terminal  One (1) Emergency and two (2) Urgent software changes
WPS-W  One (1) Emergency and two (2) Urgent software changes

The contractor shall have experience with Oracle Tools, Oracle Suite Software, UNIX, WINDOWS, Ada, C, C++, F-Secure, Open SSH, HP secure shell, PKI, PERL, and Intelligent Query(IQ), PL/SQL 2.2.3, IRL, Dimensions, IGNITE, and Java scripting.  The contractor shall provide verification of personnel capabilities to the COR, either in the form of an experience matrix, resumes, certificates or other documentation indicating possession of specific experience/capabilities.  In addition to possessing experience in the current software versions used by WPS, the contractor shall ensure team members are kept current in the latest systems software releases for the software listed above.  This is necessary in the event operating systems software upgrades are necessary in the future.

Aspects of the anticipated requirement are classified as SECRET.  The daily work associated with this requirement is expected UNCLASSIFIED, but may require occasional access to buildings which requires a SECRET eligibility/access and other Department of Defense facilities located throughout the world.  A DD Form 254 would be attached with the solicitation.  

Other than any Government furnished equipment, the contractor shall provide all space, equipment and resources needed to successfully execute this contract.  The contractor shall have sufficient coverage to perform the requirements at the Contractors location during the Government core hours (0900  1500 hours, local time, Monday  Friday).

Any questions related to this posting shall be submitted via email to Mr. David Swaney at david.swaney@ustranscom.mil.

Re:  Fall Viewing of Activities for FY 2009

To:  Prospective Bidders


Due to anticipated snow conditions at the time of issue for these reforestation and related projects, this fall will be the only time that bidders will have the opportunity to see the proposed sites on the Fremont-Winema National Forests.
There will be no scheduled showing trips nor will Forest Service employees accompany prospective bidders to project sites.  However, bidders are reminded that it is their responsibility to determine for themselves the actual site conditions and only by physical inspection, on-the-ground viewing. can offerors assure themselves of the existing conditions.  Maps will be available at the District offices.
The attached are the proposed reforestation and related projects for FY 2009.
If you have any questions or concerns please contact the contact person for the project on the district or Patti Shuffield, (541) 947-6228.
Thank you for your interest.

Sincerely,
PATTI SHUFFIELD
Procurement Technician

To the extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment.

If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.<br />c. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.<br />d. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any<br />(1) completed supplies, and<br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.<br />e. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.<br />f. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.<br />g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.<br />11. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE (JAN 2005) - Inspection and acceptance will be at destination, unless otherwise provided in this contract.

HOLD AND SAVE HARMLESS (JAN 2005) - The Contractor shall indemnify, hold and save harmless, and defend the NAFI, its outlets and customers from any liability, claimed or established for violation or infringement of any patent, copyright, or trademark right asserted by any third party with respect to goods hereby ordered or any part thereof.

If any such tax, duty, or other public charge has been included in the contract price, through error or otherwise, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced.<br />b. If for any reason, after the contract date of execution, the Contractor or subcontractor is relieved in whole or in part from the payment or the burden of any tax, duty, or other public charge included in the contract price, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced; or if the Contractor or subcontractor is required to pay in whole or in part any tax, duty, of other public charge which was not applicable at the contract date of execution the contract price shall be correspondingly increased.<br />18.

Otherwise, a stamped copy of a Certificate of Mailing issued by the US Postal Service must be furnished. If shipment is made by a common carrier (rail, air or motor freight), the Contractor must furnish a signed copy of the shipping document on which items are receipted for by the common carrier. A signed receipt by a NAFI representative at the delivery point (CCP or POE) is also acceptable evidence of proof of shipment.<br />b. Forwarding a proof of shipment and an invoice for payment by the Contractor shall be construed as a certification by the contractor that the items shipped conform to the specifications.<br />c. Notwithstanding any provisions of this clause or any payment made pursuant to the terms of this clause prior to receipt of the items contracted for, the NAFI retains the right to inspect upon receipt and the right to reject nonconforming items. The liability of the Contractor with respect to items for which payments have been made will, after inspection by the NAFI or after the expiration of a reasonable time following delivery to the NAFI within which inspection may be made, whichever occurs first, be limited to<br />(i) exceptions taken at the time of inspection, and (ii) latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as amount to fraud.<br />19. COMMERCIAL WARRANTY (JAN 2005) - The Contractor agrees that the supplies or services furnished under this contract shall be covered by the most favorable commercial warranties the Contractor gives to any customer for such supplies or services and that the rights and remedies provided herein are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the NAFI by any other clause of this contract.

DISCOUNTS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT (JAN 2005)<br />a. Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of offers. However, any offered discount will form a part of the award, and will be taken if payment is made within the discount period indicated in the offer by the offeror. As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices.<br />b. In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified payment date. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day.<br />22.

Invoices shall be prepared and submitted in duplicate one copy shall be marked "Original") unless otherwise specified.<br />b. For purposes of determining if interest begins to accrue under the PROMPT PAYMENT ACT (PUBLIC LAW 97-177):<br />(i) A proper invoice will be deemed to have been received when it is received by the office designated in the contract for receipt of invoices and acceptance of the supplies delivered or services rendered has occurred.<br />(ii) Payment shall be considered made on the date on which a check for such payment is dated.<br />(iii) Payment terms (e.g., "Net 20") offered by the contractor will not be deemed Required payment dates.<br />(iv) The following periods of time will not be included:<br />(A) After receipt of improper invoice and prior to notice of any defect or impropriety, but not to exceed three days for meat and meat food products, five days for perishable agricultural commodities, and 15 days in all other cases, and<br />(B) Between the date of a notice of any defect or impropriety and the date a proper invoice is received.

<DESC><p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">This amendment changes the&nbsp;response date to October 23, 2008.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">The General Services Administration, on behalf of the US Army Project Manager Command Posts of Fort Monmouth, NJ, intends to negotiate and award a&nbsp;sole source contract with General Dynamics, C4S located in Taunton, Massachusetts on an other than full and open competition basis pursuant to&nbsp;FAR 6.302-1.&nbsp; Additionally, depending on mission requirements, it is probable that FAR Part 6.302-2 will be utilized as is&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;existing task orders under&nbsp;other current contracts for Mission Critical Defense System&nbsp;equipments described&nbsp;below in this announcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">General Dynamics, C4S possesses unique knowledge, test bed and production line capabilities for immediate fulfillment and&nbsp;/ or resolution of requirements as they arise pertaining to each&nbsp;potential task order for&nbsp;the unique and proprietary equipments and test bed for the Mission Critical Defense System as described below.&nbsp; This action will result in the establishment of a comprehensive technical and support services contract&nbsp;with&nbsp;a three-year base period inclusive of&nbsp;two additional one-year&nbsp;options. The anticipated period of performance for the base&nbsp;contract is February 1, 2009 through January 31, 2012 with an overall&nbsp;potential period of performance through January 31, 2014, if the option periods are exercised.&nbsp; The government will issue a public announcement and conduct market research before exercising the possible option periods.</span></p>
<p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">The anticipated&nbsp;contract will be a single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract, which will allow for the issuance of cost reimbursement, time and materials, labor hour or fixed price type task orders. The task order type shall be dependent on the nature of the work performed.&nbsp; The US Army Project Manager Command Posts (PM CP) manages many of the current tactical circuit switches, and communications management systems at Echelons Above Corps (EAC) and Echelons Corps and Below (ECB) presently in operation with the U.S. Army.&nbsp; The requirements of the anticipated sole source contract shall&nbsp;provide PM CP with support services for a communication system that is employed in battlefield environments. This communication system is known as the "Mission Critical Defense System". The support services required for this Mission Critical Defense System consist of the following: system engineering, program management, software engineering, logistical support, training device upgrades, fielding and field support, depot support, testing and limited production capabilities.&nbsp; The supported systems and equipment include, but are not limited to the AN/TTC/TYC-39 and the Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) Family of Switches, switch components, and derivative variants, including export versions for foreign military sales (IMSE) and enhancements provided as part of the Area Common User System Modernization Program (ACUS MOD).&nbsp; This equipment operates the TRI-TAC (Tri-Service Tactical Communications)/ACUS System and MSE and its derivative systems for all of the Army EAC, ECB, and International customers.</span></p>
<p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">The&nbsp;Mission Critical Defense System is a tactical communication legacy system that has been in the military inventory for a number of years. This system provides secure voice, data and satellite communications between battlefield commanders and for the soldiers in the field. This system is vital to military operations and other Joint Defense missions worldwide. As this system is deployed, it requires support, maintenance, unscheduled upgrades and the procurement of additional hardware and software. As this equipment continues to age, it will require a wide range of technical and field support services. The support furnished through this contract is needed to ensure that this legacy equipment provides the communications essential to military forces.&nbsp; The total replacement of the system described above is anticipated to occur&nbsp;approximately in the year 2012. Until that replacement takes place, meeting the requirements contained within this acquisition is essential to the military's communications capabilities, and will ensure that PM CP can meet their worldwide mission of providing life cycle management, maintenance, enhancements, refinements, and improvements to the unique and proprietary mission critical defense system.</span></p>
<p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">A "Source Sought" notice under Solicitation number GS02T08CJD0820, which initially&nbsp;identified the requirements of this acquisition, was published on June 5, 2008 through FedBizOpps and had a response date of June 20, 2008. The technical staff of PM CP and GSA conducted a review and analysis of&nbsp;respondent capabilities. PM CP concluded that none of the vendors other than General Dynamics C4S are capable of fulfilling the PM CP requirements that are included in this acquisition without a significant or total disruption to the PM CP Programs.</span></p>
<p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">This notice of sole source intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no formal solicitation package is available. However, interested parties may identify their capability to meet the requirements by submitting a white paper, technical data for the item, and past performance data no later than 13 October 2008.&nbsp; No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information.&nbsp;&nbsp; No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort.&nbsp; This notice is being publicized in accordance with FAR 5.205(c) to increase competition and broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements. Industry is advised that comments may be submitted to the point of contact identified in this notice. However, questions will be treated as comments and responses will not be provided at this time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">However, any and each potential contractor response to this&nbsp;other than full and open competition sole source&nbsp;intent announcement will be reviewed to assess the extent to which the contractor's current technical and management capabilities, as well as past performance, would enable the contractor to possibly perform the key program management and technical tasks identified by the criteria elements indicated above. Possible subcontracting opportunities to a prime vendor are unknown at this time. Any interest should be conveyed with a title page containing the vendor name, date, and the name and telephone number of the author and/or other points of contact. A white paper description of possible capabilities should provide evidence of vendor past performance experience,&nbsp;technical data for the items&nbsp;and briefly summarize the capabilities to support above cited systems. The&nbsp;description should&nbsp;reflect the vendor's previous demonstrated performance in managing and supporting similar&nbsp;systems comparable in size and complexity. Vendors must provide all such information in writing.</span></p>
<p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">Although no competition is anticipated for this requirement, maximum consideration will be given to subcontracting with small business, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business in accordance with FAR Part l9. A small business and small disadvantaged business-subcontracting plan is required and stringent small business, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women owned small business subcontracting goals will be established. In addition to the possible subcontracting requirements, the government will issue a public announcement and conduct market research before exercising the option period.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">Questions and/or comments regarding this notice&nbsp;may be submitted via e-mail to charles.ade@gsa.gov or charm.yeung@gsa.gov. Verbal questions and/or comments will NOT be accepted.</span></p>
