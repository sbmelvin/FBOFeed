<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Acquisition Operations Group, Denver, Colorado, intends to award on a sole-source basis to the California Urban Water Conservation Council (CUWCC), 455 Capitol Mall, Suite 703, Sacramento, CA 95814-0000 for Phase 2 of the Best Management Practices Reporting Database.
Project Summary
The CUWCC will implement Phase 2 of the BMP Reporting Database System, which incorporates reports for analyzing the statewide water agency data, user administration for agency administrative users, USBR contractor management, weather normalization additions to the Gallons per Capita per Day (GPCD) coverage track, Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) modifications and coverage logic that follows the legislation in SBx7-7.
The CUWCC is a non-profit organization which has led urban water use efficiency efforts throughout the state since its inception in 1991.  There is enormous value in tracking and demonstrating the effectiveness of water use efficiency efforts in the state, and the CUWCC has provided that information through its best management practices (BMP) reporting database. 
Background
The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Mid Pacific Region has contracted with the CUWCC to enable Urban Water Contractors to submit annual updates to their Urban Water Management Plans via the CUWCC's Best Management Practices (BMP) Reporting website. As the annual update contains information on the implementation progress of the BMPs, Reclamation accepts the BMP Coverage Requirements Reports as compliance reports for their urban contractors. Work on the project has continued to date.  A project advisory team comprised of CUWCC members, subject matter experts and technical experts has guided the project during this time, with Reclamation staff participation. 
Phase 2 Development
The reporting system will continue to be adaptable to future changes in legislation, regulatory and MOU requirements. Phase 2 of the reporting system incorporates reports for analyzing the statewide water agency data, user administration for agency administrative users, USBR contractor management, weather normalization additions to the GPCD coverage track, MOU modifications and coverage logic that follows the legislation in SBx7-7. Phase 2 of the database will provide the ability to manage the contractor data, query submittal progress, analyze water savings from the BMP activities, and analyze the types of activities and programs. Phase 2 will provide weather normalization in determining GPCD calculations which follows the State of California legislation in SBx7-7. Weather normalization provides a clear method of calculating water savings due to water conservation through normalizing the weather data. Which means that when water savings is being analyzed, the weather years are similar and water savings is not being exaggerated due to a or multiple drought years. The project duration is estimated to be 17 months, which will include a 12-month base period and two 6-month option periods.
New features to be developed during this phase include the following: "	Customer query capacity for Reclamation to manage contractor information and create custom reports. "	Weather normalized GPCD and SBx7-7 components "	Improvements in displaying water savings across reporting years and periods; "	Improve user experience with validation, context-sensitive Online Help, removal of duplicative data entry needs; "	Improvements to user documentation; "	Updates and improvements to reporting forms and the user interface; "	Update of the ASP framework used by the software; "	Update to SQL Server 2012;
The authority for use of other than full and open competition for this transaction is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1 ) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 
This procurement shall be awarded using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, NAICS code 813312, with an intended period of performance ending July 31, 2015. Anticipated award date is August 01, 2013. 
All responsible sources may submit a capability statement by 8:00 am MST, July 22, 2013, which shall be considered by the agency. 
Questions regarding this notice and responses to this notice shall be submitted to Synthia Archuleta, Contract Specialist, via e-mail to sarchuleta@usbr.gov.

<SUBJECT>Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey
<SOLNBR>HHSM-500-2013-RFP-0036
<CONTACT>Jennifer L. Hennessy, Phone 410-786-2460, Email jennifer.hennessy@cms.hhs.gov - Charles Littleton, Phone 410-786-3291, Email charles.littleton@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award a cost plus fixed-fee contract for design, data collection, and data preparation to continue the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS); a multi-year, longitudinal survey of a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries. In-person interviews for the MCBS have been conducted three times a year since 1991, and currently use Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) technology.
<p>The sample consists of approximately 16,000 individuals drawn from the Medicare enrollment files in over 100 primary sampling units. Interviews are approximately one hour in length, use pre-loaded CMS administrative data and previously collected survey data, and cover health care utilization, expenditures, insurance coverage, health status, illness, disability, and demographic and behavioral characteristics. Survey data will be augmented with CMS administrative data, validated and weighted to produce national and regional estimates. Quick turnaround of high quality data will be emphasized, as well as innovative approaches to design and implementation of the MCBS, given the evolving healthcare landscape.</p>
<p>The proposed period of performance is five (5) years from the date of contract award. We anticipate this solicitation to be posted to the FedBizOps.gov website in May 2013.</p>

<DESC>This project will relocate the existing 8-element Mark 1F Localizer antenna array, shelter and DME outside of the RSA and OFA at the Rapid City Regional Airport, Rapid City, South Dakota.  This project will be broken up into three phases of construction.  There will be a break in construction over the winter between Phase 1 and Phase 2.  Be aware that reconstruction of the Runway 14 blast pad may also be taking place at the same time as the localizer relocation project under a different contract.  

The contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, materials, and equipment to perform the project in accordance with the contract clauses, drawings, and specifications.

The contractor shall coordinate the exact sequence of work with the airport authority through the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) prior to construction and shall provide updated construction schedules at the preconstruction conference and upon request.  Contractor shall hold a tailgate safety meeting prior to commencement of work each day, in the presence of the COR, to discuss possible safety hazards and mitigation.  Work performed inside the Runway Safety Area (RSA) will require the closure of the runway or be adjusted by a declared distance/displaced threshold.  The work under this contract shall be performed in the following phases:

Phase 1:  This phase will take place in August of 2013.  The contractor shall build up the area on the North end of the airport with approximately 31,500 c.y. of borrow material from on airport borrow site.  Construct concrete pier foundations for Localizer antenna array, DME antenna mast and slab foundation for LOC shelter.  Concrete work may be done concurrently with earthwork as long as it does not impede the progress of the earthwork.  Trench and bore for new power line installed by West River Electric.  Construct new 10 airport perimeter security fence on built up earth.   Set Government furnished pre-fab shelter on slab foundation.  Install lightning protection and counterpoise around shelter and DME.  Construct new gravel access road.  A portion of this work will require work inside the RSA.  A request for a declared distance of 300 of the Runway 14 threshold has been submitted.  If a declared distance is granted, work shall be allowed within 300 of the end of the RSA with restrictions on the heights of the equipment.  A final determination will be made no later than the pre-construction meeting.  Please note that the Runway 32 ILS system will remain in service throughout Phase 1.  The contractor must complete Phase 1 within forty five (45) calendar days.  Phase 2 shall not begin until the following year of 2014.  

Phase 2:  The following phases will take place in 2014.  Portions of the following work will require the shut-down of the Runway 32 ILS system.  This shutdown shall be coordinated by the COR and the Airport.  Phase 2 shall not start until FAA installation personnel are available and a schedule has been coordinated.  A tentative schedule shall be available 60 days prior to Phase 2 construction.  Coordination will take place approximately 10 days before Phase 2 begins.  Portions of work in Phases 2 and 3 may need to be completed at night, when the runway is closed, as work will be inside the RSA.  A request for a temporary declared distance will be submitted by the FAA and if granted, will allow for work inside the RSA when the runway is open, with restrictions on equipment height.  A second 8-element Mark 1F Localizer system shall be provided by the FAA to be installed by the contractor and used as a leapfrog while the existing Runway 32 Localizer is still in service.  Once the Localizer system is installed and the FAA installation technicians are ready to tune the new system, an outage will be scheduled for the Runway 32 Localizer.  Immediately after the Runway 32 Localizer has been shut-down, the contractor shall disassemble the existing Localizer antenna array and crate/labeled for the FAA.  FAA installation technicians will relocate existing DME antenna and related equipment or install a new (Government Furnished) DME antenna and related equipment.  Demolition of the antenna array foundations and removal of the crushed rock path shall then take place.  The contractor shall trench in the REIL and Localizer power and control cables.  Final grade within the localizer critical area shall be completed.  The contractor must complete Phase 2 within ten (10) calendar days.

Phase 3:  The following work may be completed simultaneously with the Phase 2 work, however, shall not impede the progress of the Phase 2 work.  The contractor shall demolish the existing Localizer shelter, remove the asphalt/crushed rock access road, and grade and hydroseed all disturbed areas.  Demolition shall not occur until FAA installation technicians have verified that all equipment has been removed from the shelter.  All grading in RSA must be completed in this phase prior to flight check.  The contractor must complete Phase 3 within seven (7) calendar days.

Contract performance time is 62 calendar days for all three phases, with an anticipated start date of August 20, 2013.  The estimated price range for this procurement is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.

INTERESTED FIRMS MUST HAVE SUCESSFULLY COMPLETED SIMILAR PROJECTS BOTH IN DOLLAR AMOUNT AND SCOPE OF WORK AT AN OPERATIONAL AIRPORT.

<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with : Vermont Photonics of Brattleboro, VT for the purchase of Moller-Wedel Elcomat 3000 Autocollimator under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106(b)(1). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements:</p>
<p>NIST currently has an angle artifact measuring system used for multiple types of customer artifacts that uses (2) Moller-Wedel Elcomat 2000 autocollimators either solo or in pairs. The system is interfaced to automatic data collection running proprietary software. The Elcomat 3000 instrument is the updated model that will direct-fit (plug and play) into the existing measurement system and is intended to expand NIST's optical measurement capability of lower-reflectivity artifacts. The NIST Dimensional Metrology Group needs this additional capability in order to continue the development of critical new measurement services.</p>
<p><br />A sole source determination is based on the following: Only Vermont Photonics can meet our technical requirements.</p>
<p>The 3000 autocollimater will replace the 2000, any other company's autocollimater cannot be used because of the proprietary software being run.</p>
<p>Vermont Photonics is the only provider of the Moller-Wedel Elcomat 3000 autocollimator. There are no re-sellers.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (EST) on July 19, 2013. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Christopher.ganey@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Oxford Instruments America, Inc., 300 Baker Ave., Ste 150, Concord, MA for the acquisition of an Oxford ALD/Ellipsometer upgrade needed by the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.<br />Sole Source determination is based on the requirement for a custom upgrade of an existing Oxford Instruments FlexALRPT ALD system, to provide enhanced film thickness control using an existing ellipsometer. This purchase will include both hardware components proprietary to Oxford Instruments and design and installation services requiring expert knowledge of proprietary Oxford Instruments systems. The custom upgrade will integrate an existing spectroscopic ellipsometer owned by the CNST into CNST's existing Oxford Instruments FlexALPRT system to enable in-situ ellipsometric measurements to be performed during the ALD process. The integration of the ellipsometer will provide more sophisticated control of the ALD process and enable new processes to be performed, including deposition of multi-layer coatings. The existing system has been wholly designed, engineered, and built by Oxford Instruments with their proprietary components and software. The additional hardware, custom software, and engineering expertise required for this integration are only available from Oxford Instruments. This will be the first such Oxford Instruments ALD system ever upgraded with this capability, so there are no others with prior experience with such custom upgrades or the expertise to perform it.<br />*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 811219, and the size standard is $19.0.
<p>******A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>*****No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for quotations. However, responses received by July 20, 2013 will be considered by the Government.</p>

In making such a determination, GSA will consider cost factors including, but not limited to, the total cost of the physical move (including telecommunications and computer cabling costs); tenant improvement costs (whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent); and anticipated rent for the space. Other factors impacting the Government's rights under a prospective lease, such as the length of any firm term that may be required at an alternative location, length of time necessary to deliver occupancy-ready space, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term, will also bear.</p>

<DESC><p>GENERAL INFORMATION:</p>
<p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND IS BEING USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARKET ANALYSIS ONLY. The Government is seeking industry input to determine the availability of qualified sources with the technical capability to fulfill the Alaska Radar System (ARS) requirement described below. No contract awards will be made from this notice and no solicitation is available on FBO or any other bulletin boards, posting rooms, or clearinghouses at this time. In order to develop a sound acquisition strategy, early industry participation is highly encouraged. Respondents will not be notified of the responses to this notice. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, this notice is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations. Information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary or Confidential" will not be disclosed outside of Government channels. All responses will be used in whole or in part for determining the most effective acquisition strategy for future ARS acquisitions or similar requirements.</p>
<p>SECTION 1 - BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>1.1 The Government has a continuing requirement for non-personal services necessary for the Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) of the ARS. The requirement consists of O&amp;M of 15 geographically separated long-range radar sites (accessible by air and/or seasonal barge), three remote radio sites, and the Maintenance Control and Communications Center (MC3) activities of the Regional Air Operations Center (RAOC) at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska. The radar operations are in direct support of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and the United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) mission for air sovereignty within Alaska and provide civil aircraft information to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This requirement also includes the O&amp;M of facilities, seven (7) gravel airstrips, various beach reinforcement structures, gravel access roads, utilities, water/wastewater systems, power generation, environmental management, snow removal, transportation, weather observation, logistics support, billeting services, dining facility services, and third-party support for other federal and state agencies.</p>
<p>1.2. The ARS requirement is categorized by two distinct NAICS, which are 561210 "Facilities Support Services" and 517919 "All Other Telecommunications". Both industries are critical to the success of the ARS mission and cannot be segregated into separate requirements without unreasonable cost, schedule, and performance risk to the Government. The current ARS contract was awarded on 1 October 2004 for (1) one base year and (9) nine one-year option periods and will expire on 30 September 2014. The current contract was awarded as a Fixed-Price-Award-Fee (FPAF) type contract. The core mission area of this requirement is O&amp;M of long-range radar systems, including all related telecommunications / electronics equipment and subsystems. However, facilities support services represent a greater percentage of relative effort and are critical to the success of the mission.</p>
<p>SECTION 2 - PURPOSE OF SOURCES SOUGHT:</p>
<p>2.1. The Government is seeking industry input from all sources to determine the best acquisition approach to obtain the unique and highly specialized services described in section 1 above. In an effort to maximize competition and broaden industry participation, the Government is implementing an Essential Parts Replacement Program (EPRP) currently led by the Ogden Air Logistics Center at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. Lockheed Martin will be modernizing the 15 AN/FPS-117 long-range surveillance radars in Alaska by upgrading the radars with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components (technology refresh). The EPRP will facilitate future upgrades, which will replace and update all the radars to current commercial technology standards, cost effectively extending their operational lives through 2025. The estimated completion of the EPRP is expected in Fiscal Year 2016.</p>
<p>2.2. The future success of ARS is dependent upon full completion of the EPRP upgrade, including phased-in installation, testing, and government acceptance. Initial installation has begun at specific sites, including training and procurement of test-set equipment in support of the Atmospheric Early Warning System (AEWS) Program. In order to de-conflict the full installation schedule, the Government is anticipating award of the ARS requirement upon full completion of the EPRP install. Awarding this requirement any sooner would result in significant delays in the upgrade and operability of the radar system.</p>
<p>SECTION 3 - SCOPE OF SERVICES:</p>
<p>See attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) for details.</p>
<p>SECTION 4 - QUESTIONS:</p>
<p>4.1. The Government is strongly considering a total Small Business Set-Aside for this requirement and is currently exploring five (5) potential scenarios for contract requirements, depending on industry feedback and number of respondents. In the sections below, Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 are primarily designed for Small Business while Scenarios 4 and 5 allow for Large Business participation. Scenarios 4 and 5 will only be considered if two or more capable small business entities are not expected to positively respond. The Air Force is also willing to consider scenarios other than those described herein. The Government is asking industry to provide information regarding any planned teaming arrangements being considered.</p>
<p>Scenario #1 Small Business Prime Contractor - A certified Small Business Entity (registered under NAICS 561210) as Prime Contractor with the technical capability of independently performing 100% of the ARS Requirement under both NAICS, including but not limited to specific experience/capabilities to support the AN/FPS-117 Radar System in accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS). In this scenario, the Small Business Prime Contractor is responsible for 100% of the requirement; however, if a portion of the work is subcontracted, the Small Business Entity must comply with FAR 52.219-14(c) - Limitation on Subcontracting and at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. However, IAW the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a deviation to the subcontracting limit changed the term "personnel cost" to "total contract price".</p>
<p>Scenario #2 Small Business Joint Venture (JV) - A certified Small Business Entity (registered under NAICS 561210) with the technical capability of performing a minimum of 50% of the overall ARS Requirement under Facilities Support Services in accordance with the PWS and entering into a JV partnership arrangement with another business entity (registered under NAICS 517919 if a small business) and/or (if a large business) possessing the technical capability to operate and maintain all telecommunications systems required in the PWS, including specific experience/capabilities to support the AN/FPS-117 Radar System. In this scenario, the JV is responsible for 100% of the requirement; however, if a portion of the work is subcontracted, the JV must comply with FAR 52.219-14(c) - Limitation on Subcontracting and at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. However, IAW the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a deviation to the subcontracting limit changed the term "personnel cost" to "total contract price".</p>
<p>Scenario #3 Small Business Prime Contractor/Subcontractor Team Arrangement (other than a JV) - A certified Small Business Entity (registered under NAICS 561210) as Prime Contractor with the technical capability of performing a minimum of 50% of the overall ARS Requirement under Facilities Support Services in accordance with the PWS and through a subcontracting arrangement (other than a JV) for up to but not exceeding 50% of the remaining requirement to include NAICS 517919 for the operation and maintenance of all telecommunications systems required in the PWS, including specific experience/capabilities to support the AN/FPS-117 Radar System. The Small Business Entity must comply with FAR 52.219-14(c) - Limitation on Subcontracting. At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. However, IAW the 2013 NDAA, a deviation to the subcontracting limit changed the term "personnel cost" to "total contract price". For this scenario, the phrase "other than a JV" means an arrangement in which a small business and one or more other entities form a business association or other collaboration and consortium agreement.</p>
<p>Scenario #4 Large Business Prime Contractor - A Large Business as Prime Contractor with the technical capability of independently performing 100% of the ARS requirement in accordance with the PWS, including specific experience/capabilities to support the AN/FPS-117 Radar System. IAW FAR 19.702 - Statutory Requirements, submission of an acceptable subcontracting plan will be required.</p>
<p>Scenario # 5 Large and/or Small Business Contractor Teaming Arrangement (other than traditional partnering) - A Teaming Arrangement between two or more businesses of any size to act jointly as a Prime Contractor, with the technical capability of performing 100% of the ARS requirement in accordance with the PWS, including specific experience/capabilities to support the AN/FPS-117 Radar System. IAW FAR 19.702 - Statutory Requirements, submission of an acceptable subcontracting plan will be required. For this scenario, the phrase "Teaming Arrangement" means two or more companies forming a business association of any kind in order to enable the companies involved to complement each other's unique capabilities.</p>

<CONTACT>Stacey Coolican, Contracting Officer, Email stacey.coolican@usmc.mil
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) which seeks information on various approaches to provide a limited reset approach for the AAVP7A1 variant. This is NOT a request for proposal and no RFP is available at this time. The Government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice. Issuance of this Notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these items or to issue a solicitation. Additionally, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this RFI and responses to this notice will not be accepted as offers. Proprietary information should be clearly marked. The requested information is for planning and market research purposes only. Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The United States Marine Corps (USMC) Program Manager Advanced Amphibious Assault (PM AAA) is conducting market research to analyze viable approaches for the sustaining maintenance of the USMC Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV). The Government seeks information from commercial and Government entities that are experienced in performing limited reset (replace/recapitalize/repair) services on tracked vehicles within the Department of Defense (DoD) inventory.</p>
<p>The AAV is the USMC's self-deploying, fully amphibious combat vehicle that supports the Joint Forces and the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) to conduct operations across the full Range of Military Operations. The AAV7A1 Family of Vehicles (FoV) consists of three (3) variants: a Personnel (P7), a Command and Control (C7), and Recovery (R7) variant. Originally fielded in 1971, the AAV is the oldest vehicle platform in the USMC inventory and the last major rebuild effort was completed in 2007. The USMC has a current inventory of 1,064 vehicles. The end-of-life for this platform has been extended until 2030. PM AAA is developing an acquisition strategy for a survivability upgrade on roughly 40 percent of the vehicles in service; however, this effort does not address long term sustaining maintenance effort. PM AAA is considering approaches similar to a limited rebuild/reset effort to support extending the vehicle life cycle.</p>
<p>For purposes of this effort, a limited reset is defined as a set of actions or processes to restore equipment to the level achieved at the completion of the 2007 major rebuild.</p>
<p>The three (3) components in a limited reset are identified as:</p>
<p>(1) Replacement - An effort to buy new parts and replace obsolete or worn parts which include replacement of identified high failure parts, expected components (such as seals, o-rings, fittings and other like components), and is critical to extend the life cycle</p>
<p>(2) Recapitalization - An effort that extends the equipment's useful life by returning it to a near zero-mile/zero-hour condition to the original performance specifications</p>
<p>(3) Repair - An effort that repairs or overhauls the equipment's condition to the Marine Corps standard</p>
<p>A limited reset approach is not intended to increase the capability of the legacy platform; however, it is intended to enhance reliability due to the focused attention on sustaining maintenance. Specific maintenance actions taken/executed on an individual AAV during a limited reset may be dependent on the condition of the asset when it is introduced into the process.</p>
<p>PM AAA is conducting market research to assess available sources to perform a limited reset for the AAV fleet from Fiscal Year FY 16 through FY 30. The Government is considering approaches that conform to industry best practices, which may consider a public/private approach, a purely public approach, or a purely private approach. In short, PM AAA is seeking to understand proven, implemented approaches that have historical data/feedback which can be applied to this platform and is interested in various approaches for consideration.</p>
<p>Requested Information:</p>
<p>PM AAA is seeking information in consideration of a limited reset approach for the AAVP7A1 (Personnel) variant. Replies should be based on proven historical implementation and assumptions relative to the AAV platform. To ensure a comparative analysis on alternatives, request information based on the following scenarios:</p>
<p>Scenario 1 - Seeks an Inspect and Repair Only As Necessary (IROAN) approach. This scenario can be further disaggregated into two separate techniques:</p>
<p>Technique 1: an IROAN approach that strips the vehicle to a base hull, inspects the components and subsystems, replaces the mandatory items, replaces/repairs identified pieces, restores and inspects the vehicle and then completes testing</p>
<p>Technique 2: an IROAN approach where the facility inspects the vehicle and replaces as required and replaces/repairs as identified through inspection or lessons learned from other vehicles, restores and inspects the vehicle and then completes testing</p>
<p>Scenario 2 - Seeks an open approach based on the facility's best practices and lessons learned that provides an efficient and effective approach to meeting objectives for a limited reset approach. Respondent should provide scenarios that fit the capability of the facility.</p>
<p>Scenario 3 - Incorporates all aspects of scenario 2 in conjunction with performing an AAV Force Protection Upgrade referenced in RFI (M67854-13-I-0015 - AAV Force Protection Improvements).</p>
<p>Given the scenarios described above, Provide the below information in your response:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide information for a method for obtaining replacement parts (diminishing supply parts management) with the same form/fit/function;<br />&bull; Provide information on potential approaches to manage a limited reset process with consideration for all known potential activities associated with the AAV. For example, scenarios could consider a split work effort between a prime Contractor and a Government depot if that solution is deemed optimal.<br />&bull; Provide information about a potential limited reset line to include locations, institutionalized business practices and/or lessons learned, a high level flow through stages/phases/shops of a vehicle to take advantage of efficiencies;<br />&bull; What industry best practices and/or lessons learned are needed to appropriately manage a limited reset process;<br />&bull; What industry best practices/lessons learned are in place to address cost avoidance and best value for a limited reset line? Consider obsolescence, remanufacturing components, available material sources, current active production line capabilities;<br />&bull; How can/should obsolescence issues be handled and what are industry best practices to address potential material wait time;<br />&bull; What is a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) to maintain an efficient limited reset line? Consider cost by phase (in terms of stripping hulls and/or inspecting vehicles, replacing or repairing identified items and mandatory parts, and restoring and testing); <br />&bull; What should be the expected mix for labor and material costs for a limited reset line and what approaches could be implemented to manage these costs and methods to maintain throughput and maintain process efficiently;<br />&bull; What is the optimum and maximum throughput (defined as number of vehicles through a limited reset line) annually and in days should a limited reset line be able to maintain assuming a fleet of 1,064 units; <br />&bull; What should be the cycle times (defined as work days from start to finish) for vehicles through the facility;<br />&bull; What is the expected percentage of rework and how is rework managed on a limited reset line;<br />&bull; How can risks (cost, schedule, performance, supply, quality) be mitigated to address supply and manufacturing challenges; and<br />&bull; How is the quality measured on the products from a limited reset line, how is data collected after fielding the product? What are the historical trends in quality from proven, implemented limited reset lines?</p>
<p>For ROM cost information, the Program Office requests the following be included (all cost in Base Year 14 dollars):</p>
<p>&bull; Labor hours and rates by phase (stripping hulls, inspection, repairing/replacing, reassemble, etc.)<br />&bull; Unburdened (raw) Material, Labor, and Other Costs<br />&bull; Burden rates to obtain Price Line Cost<br />&bull; Labor and Material Power Curves</p>
<p>In order to have a better understanding of your facility's experience in the implementation of a limited reset approach; Please provide a contract number, product, customer program office, and a customer point of contact for each item. This information will allow the Government to better understand various acquisition strategies and business approaches from a customer's perspective. The Government reserves the right to contact any contact provided. Vendors are under no obligation to provide this information.</p>
<p>Additional Information:<br />Assumptions are identified as:<br />&bull; AAV end of life is 2030<br />&bull; Minimum throughput is 96 vehicles per year<br />&bull; Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 1,064 vehicles which are constant and in mixed condition<br />&bull; AAV special tools/equipment for a limited reset line would be provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)</p>
<p>The following AAV components/parts represent the 10 highest cost elements by National Stock Number (NSN):</p>

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, with the University of Georgia Research Foundation, Incorporated, of Athens, Georgia, for the acquisition of Cyclospora cayetanensis oocysts for the scientists at FDA. Cyclospora cayetanensis is a food borne parasite that cannot be propagated in the laboratory (in vivo or in vitro). Thus, any work associated with this parasite entails acquiring fecal samples of naturally infected individuals. <br /><br />Sole source determination is based on the need for continued effort and collaboration between FDA laboratories and University of Georgia/Dr. Ynes Ortega. Cyclospora cayetanensis oocysts are difficult to obtain, and processing them from human stool requires a high degree of skill and experience. Cyclospora cayetanensis is pathogen listed in a high priority Import Produce Assignment (DFPG# 13-15). In order to ensure that the method used to detect this parasite in produce is efficient and trustworthy, a supply of Cyclospora cayetanensis oocysts is necessary. Also, oocysts are required for other important research including identification of oocyst wall surface components and their adhesion to plants, genetic markers to be used to determine the geographic source of contaminating oocysts and future efforts to sequence the genome as well as research into virulence factors. Dr. Ynes Ortega with the University of Georgia Research Foundation is the only known source capable of providing the required services. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541712, and the size standard is 500 employees.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposed of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by July 22, 2013 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Oxford Instruments America, Inc., 300 Baker Ave., Ste 150, Concord, MA for the acquisition of a tip sharpening Tool, needed by the Physical Measurement Laboratory, at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.<br />Sole Source determination is based on the need NIST has for an accessory item to the existing Omicron Nantechnology Variable Temperature Scanning Tunneling Microscope (VT-STM). The VT-STM is a nano-scale microscope that operates by using atomically sharp tips. The atomically sharp tipsare initially prepared outside of the microscope and then in inserted into the vacuum system with the microscope. In order to realize the full capability of the microscope, the tips need to be further processed the ultra-clean environment of the microscopes vacuum system using electron beam heating and field emission. Oxford Instruments (formerly Omicron Nanotechnology) offers an accessory to their microscope that performs this task using all the same tip handling and transfer systems as their microscope, i.e., this is a" plug-and-play" solution. No other manufacturers produce this tool since its utility is limited to provide a service that is only functionally useful to the Omicron microscopes. The provided product is a complete solution incorporating the vacuum electron beam heating system compativle with their unique tip carrier assemblies, the cabling and interconnects to the power supplies and controller, and the power supply and controller system for operating the tip preparation tool. <br />*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500.
<p>******A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p><br /><br />Section C - Description/Specification/Work Statement<br />I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations. NHANES is a major program of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS is part of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and has the responsibility for producing vital and health statistics for the Nation. NHANES is overseen by the Division of Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (DHNES).</p>
<p>The NHANES program began in the early 1960's and has been conducted as a series of surveys focusing on different population groups or health topics. In 1999, the survey became a continuous program that has a changing focus on a variety of health and nutrition measurements to meet emerging needs. The survey examines a nationally representative sample of the civilian non-institutionalized United Stated population of about 5,000 persons of all ages each year. These persons are located in 15 randomly selected counties each year. Data from the examination portion of NHANES are used to obtain objective health measures. The NHANES program also assesses new methods for collecting biomedical data in the household and in the mobile examination center (MEC). New methods ensure that NHANES continues to establish national standards in health measures data collection.</p>
<p>NCHS is planning the next National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with interview and health measurement data collection beginning in December 2014. Accordingly, NCHS seeks to procure the following services: 1) statistical services related to the sample design, weighting, and related survey statistical issues; 2) data collection services related to the collection of interview and medical exam data in 15 primary sampling units (PSUs) each year; 3) physical operations services related to the operation of a household interview and medical exam survey conducted in Mobile Examination Centers (MECs) in 15 primary sampling units (PSUs) each year; and 4) information technology services related to the entry, transmission, storage, and delivery of data collected in a home and medical exam survey conducted in 15 primary sampling units (PSUs) per year and any supporting programming and other computer requirements therein. Additionally, NHANES may seek additional services for related medical data collection survey efforts such as community HANES, longitudinal HANES, feasibility studies, pilot tests, methodology studies, genetics, linkage studies, etc.</p>
<p>More information can be found on the NHANES web site: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm as well as the NCHS web site: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.htm.</p>
<p>II. PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this statement of work is to acquire statistical services, data collection services, physical operations services, information technology, and project management services which allow the NHANES survey to collect data on a nationally representative sample of the civilian non-institutionalized United Stated population of all ages in 15 primary sampling units (PSUs) annually in Mobile Examination Centers (MECs) such that data is collected in a fully automated and integrated data collection system.</p>
<p>The statistical services acquired will allow the NHANES survey to obtain a nationally representative sample, capable of national sub-population estimates, properly weighted, to support continuous NHANES data collection, as well as proper documentation regarding performed work, and perform work on other statistical tasks as required, e.g. special studies.</p>
<p>The data collection services acquired will allow the NHANES survey to obtain, using the NHANES approved survey and sampling design, interview data (e.g. demographics, dietary interview including foods and supplements, etc.) and medical exam data, bio-specimens (e.g. blood, urine, etc.), imaging (e.g. ultrasound, DXA, retinal image, etc.), and other data related to health status (e.g. tap water, home dust samples, etc.).</p>
<p>The physical operations services acquired will allow the NHANES survey to obtain all physical operations necessary to perform data collection in 15 PSUs each year.</p>
<p>The information technology services acquired will allow the NHANES survey to obtain all hardware and software needed to monitor, manage, and support all data collection activities in real or near-real time, including survey cost accounting and performance, while in compliance with federal confidentiality and security regulations.</p>
<p>In addition, this statement of work allows for the performance of special studies (e.g. community medical data collection surveys, longitudinal surveys, feasibility studies, pilot tests, methodology studies, etc.) as required.</p>
<p>III. JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>Data collection services are required by DHNES to complete the work authorized in the Public Health Service Act (42 USC 242m) by Congress. Statistical services allow DHNES to use appropriate, flexible, and efficient sampling methods regarding data collection, reducing costs for the unique national estimates of health status behaviors and conditions produced from the NHANES survey. Physical operations services are required for DHNES to collect household interview and medical exam data in 15 randomly selected PSUs each year. Household interview data is collected by field interviewers. In order to collect medical exam data in a standardized environment, NHANES requires the use of Mobile Examination Centers, i.e. a set of trailers that are outfitted for medical data collection. Support of the field interviewers and NHANES operational requirements for the MEC require the acquisition of physical operations services. Information technology services are required for DHNES to electronically collect household interview and medical exam data in 15 randomly selected counties (PSUs) each year. Household interview data is collected by field interviewers who are required to upload the data on a regular basis. Interview data (e.g. Computer Assisted Personal Interview, Audio Computer Assisted Self Interview, dietary and supplements interview, etc.) and medical exam data (e.g. height, weight, blood draw, etc.) is electronically collected in the MEC. Data collected in the MECs are transmitted daily to support all aspects of the NHANES. To support these requirements, extensive information technology services are required.</p>
<p>IV. SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform all work required to conduct the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) as authorized in the Public Health Service Act (42 USC 242m) in a manner which allows for publishable analysis of NHANES data across data collection cycles.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform statistical procedures and analyses required to conduct the NHANES survey. This includes, but is not limited to, use and development of sampling techniques for a nationally representative medical data collection survey on the civilian non-institutionalized population of the United States, including a sample frame design, primary sampling unit (PSU) selection, creation of sampling frame and listing procedures, development of survey weights, ad hoc requests regarding sample or statistical techniques, and any of the above activities for medical data collection surveys on special studies (e.g. community or longitudinal medical data collection surveys). The contractor shall create a statistical design such that one-year cycles and two-year cycles are national samples, and that data are released to the public in two-year cycles.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform data collection as required by the NHANES survey. The collection will be performed in the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) by the sample design. Data collection shall include, but not be limited to: household interviews; interviews at the Mobile Examination Center (MEC); medical exams at the MEC; imaging (e.g. DXA, ultrasound, retinal image, etc.); collection of bio-specimens (e.g. blood, urine, saliva, hair); environmental samples such as dust or tap water; and follow-up data collection, such as dietary interview phone follow-up, physical activity monitor, or tuberculosis readings. The contractor shall provide operational support for field staff. Contractor shall integrate new content into NHANES survey, typically every two years for new data collection cycles, but sometimes on a more irregular basis.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform physical operations services required to conduct the NHANES survey.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />V.C. Statistics</p>
<p>Statistics work packages involve activities which require expertise in statistics and survey statistics, sample and frame design, and data disclosure.</p>
<p><br />V.C.1 Transition</p>
<p>Contractor shall accept existing statistical work products related to NHANES data collection and make recommendation on their utility with regards to the 2015 - 2018 NHANES four year sample design period.</p>
<p><br />V.C.2 Sample Design</p>
<p>Contractor shall develop an overall survey design incorporating appropriate sampling techniques for a nationally representative medical data collection survey. Additionally, or as part of the survey design, the contractor shall develop a sample design to select a multistage, nationally representative sample of the civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population for the four-year base period of 2015 - 2018 and additional four-year option period of 2019 - 2022. This sample will be studied in order to measure and monitor the health and nutritional status for sex, race/ethnicity, income, and age subdomains of the population.</p>
<p>Contractor shall assist NCHS in developing a set of survey domains and the desired reliability of those domains. At each stage of sampling, sampling and screener rates may be set to oversample certain population groups to increase the precision of estimates from those groups.</p>
<p>As the final specifications for the sample design of the 2015 - 2018 NHANES are not available at this time, the contractor should make the following assumptions.</p>
<p>1. The contractor shall select a first stage geographic sample of primary sampling units (PSUs) that will generally be defined as a single county or adjacent counties combined to maintain a minimum size. <br />2. PSUs shall be selected from a frame of all U.S. counties using the 2010 U.S. Census Bureau data.<br />3. The PSU sample shall yield a four-year national sample composed of two consecutive two-year national samples at the PSU level and such that each annual sample is also a national sample.<br />4. The sample design shall consist of a maximum of sixty PSUs (stands) in the four-year period and fifteen PSUs (stands) in a one-year period.<br />5. PSU-level stratification variables shall be determined along with the source of such stratification variables.<br />6. A Measure of Size (MOS) shall be defined and the PSUs selected in a manner to insure adequate sample sizes for each PSU and also the overall annual survey. Adequate sample size shall be defined as equal, or nearly equal, effective sample sizes for each year, as well as for the four-year period. The target sample size for the annual sample shall be 5,000 examined persons and the target sample size for the four-year period as 20,000 examined persons.<br />7. Contingent on a definition of MOS to be used, each PSU shall be defined as self-representing (SR) or non-self-representing (NSR). A SR PSU may enter into the sample more than once in the four-year period, but not more than once in a single year.</p>
<p>At the second stage of selection, i.e. within the sample PSUs, the contractor shall select a sample of area segments comprised of census blocks or combinations of blocks. These segments will be used for the third stage of selection.</p>
<p>At the third stage of selection, i.e. within the sample segments, the contractor shall create a listing of dwelling units (DUs). This shall be performed using address-based sampling techniques where such techniques are effective, and by listers in the field where such techniques are not. These household addresses will be used for the fourth stage of selection.</p>
<p>At the fourth stage of selection, the contractor shall implement a random selection of household members in accordance with the sample design requirements. This occurs when the field interviewers perform screening of the DUs, that is, when the field interviewers list the persons in the sampled dwelling units, administer a screening questionnaire, and select the requisite sample of persons in accordance with the sample design requirements.</p>
<p>Also, when field interviewers identify errors in the household addresses that affect the sample frame, the contractor shall perform all adjustments on sample weights and sample frame as necessary.</p>
<p>Based on the proposed selection criteria, the contractor shall provide target sample sizes, sampling rates, expected yields, and expected response rates for the major selection and stratification categories.</p>
<p>The contractor should use the following precision estimates in developing a proposal. For the four-year data collection, an estimated prevalence statistic of 10% in a sex-age domain should have a relative standard error or 30% or less; and estimated (absolute) differences between domains of at least 10% should be detectable with a Type I error rate of &lt; 0.05 and a Type II error rate of &lt; 0.10. Oversampling of certain population groups will be required and may vary across data collection cycles.</p>
<p>The contractor should use the following operational considerations in developing a proposal. <br />1. The survey population is the total United States civilian non-institutionalized population for all ages;<br />2. Interviews will be collected in the home and in the Mobile Examination Center (MECs), and medical data will be collected in the MECs;<br />3. There are three sets of MECs. Each MEC can be used in five different PSUs in a 12 month period (thus the 15 PSUs yearly); and<br />4. Sample design must support analytical comparison with previous NHANES data collection cycles.</p>
<p>The contractor will document the sample design as directed by DHNES. The sample design documentation shall be delivered to DHNES within one year of the start of data collection. The contractor will document all statistical decisions made regarding sample design with memos to the record.</p>
<p><br />V.C.3 Weighting</p>
<p>Based on the established sampling procedures and the defined estimation criteria, the contractor shall develop a methodology for generating survey weights. At a minimum, the sample weights should account for the differential probabilities of selection, for out-of-scope and non-response, and difference between the final sample and the total population. The contractor shall provide an assessment of the methods proposed.</p>
<p>With approval of the COR, the contractor shall provide the oversight and computer programming resources necessary to produce final sample weights and weights for the individual survey components. The contractor shall insure the correctness of the computer programs and the accuracy of calculated weights.</p>
<p>The contractor shall also perform weighting, using techniques similar to those on the NHANES survey, for sub-samples and/or special studies as directed by DHNES.</p>
<p>The contractor will document the weighting as directed by DHNES. The contractor will document all statistical decisions made regarding weights with memos to the record. The contractor shall provide weights in an electronic format on each 2-year survey data collection cycle, and each 1-year data collection cycle for interview and exam components. The contractor shall also provide weights for sub-sampled components, e.g. components that only take place on morning exams, as requested.</p>
<p><br />V.C.4 Variance Estimates</p>
<p>Based on the sample design, the contractor shall develop methods for estimating the statistical reliability of the estimates using the Taylor Series Linearization methods for variance estimation. The contractor may propose a different method for calculating variance estimates, but must include a justification for such use. Any methods proposed must be compatible with use of SUDAAN, STATA and the SAS survey procedures.</p>
<p>With approval of the COR, the contractor shall provide the oversight and computer programming resources necessary to produce estimates of sampling variability for overall survey estimates and for estimates from the individual survey components. The contractor shall insure the correctness of the computer programs and the accuracy of the calculated variances.</p>
<p>The contractor will document the procedures for variance estimation as directed by COR. The contractor will document all statistical decisions made regarding variance estimation with memos to the record.</p>
<p><br />V.C.5 Data File Review and Release</p>
<p>The contractor shall explore the need for disclosure avoidance procedures and propose methods for masking data elements and for creating pseudo variables (such as pseudo PSUs) to insure the confidentiality of the collected data on public use files. These procedures and methods shall be in accordance with the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act (PL-107-347). The contractor shall document these efforts.</p>
<p>With the approval of the COR, the contractor shall create and deliver to COR a public use data file that incorporates sample weights and design variables necessary for producing variance estimates. This data set will be delivered to DHNES within four months of the end of data collection for each one-year and two-year survey data collection cycle. Data files will be generated using computer programs such as SAS and in accordance with the meta-data requirements provided by the COR.</p>
<p>Upon request, the contractor shall create special data sets, such as files with geographically linked data to other contextual data, or files with items too detailed to be released to the public due to confidentiality restrictions. These data sets will be delivered to COR on a mutually agreed-upon schedule.</p>
<p><br />V.C.6 Responsive Design</p>
<p>The contractor shall collect electronic Para data (i.e. data on the data collection process) as part of the screening. The contractor shall incorporate the electronically captured Para data into the data collection system that allow COR to monitor the screening and recruitment processes and make adjustments to screening and recruitment on a daily basis. Electronic Para data will be updated daily. The contractor shall deliver the Para data files to COR for each PSU within four weeks of the PSU close.</p>
<p><br />V.C.7 Related Statistical Issues</p>
<p>Upon request, the contractor shall perform statistical analysis as directed by the NHANES Project Officer, on any NHANES survey related requirements not described above. This is typically 1 - 2 large projects (40 - 80 hours per project) and 2-3 small projects (4 - 20 hours per project) each year. The output from a large project is typically a report and the output from a small project is typically a memo. Examples of large projects might include analysis of non-response bias or specialized weights not described above. Examples of small projects might include analysis of neighbor information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.C.8 Documentation</p>
<p>The contractor shall draft a report suitable for publication in the National Health Statistics Reports Series describing the 2015 - 2018 and 2019 - 2022 sample designs and estimation procedures. The contractor shall also draft a report suitable for publication in the National Health Statistics Reports Series describing the weights and variance estimation procedures.</p>

<p>G.7 Billing Instructions for Negotiated Cost-Type Contracts (Mar 2006)<br /><br />Introduction <br />Reimbursement procedures related to negotiated cost-type contracts require that Contractors submit to the Government adequately prepared claims. The instructions that follow are provided for Contractors' use in the preparation and submission of invoices or vouchers requesting reimbursement for work performed. The preparation of invoices or vouchers as outlined below will aid in the review and approval of claims and enable prompt payment to the Contractor.</p>
<p>Forms to Be Used<br />In requesting reimbursement, Contractors may use the regular Government voucher form Standard Form 1035, "Continuation Sheet," or the Contractor's own invoice form. If the Contractor desires to use the Government's standard forms, a request for the forms should be submitted to the Contracting Officer. If the Contractor uses his own invoice, the billing must conform to the instructions set forth herein.</p>
<p>REMINDER: The original and each copy should be easily identifiable. Invoices should be collated. Failure to submit invoices in the proper format may delay your payment.</p>
<p>1. Preparation of Invoices <br />a. Details of Costs Claimed<br />A detailed breakdown on Standard Form 1035 must be provided to substantiate the categories shown on the summary of costs. The following describes some of the categories that might appear on your billings:</p>
<p>(1) Direct Labor<br />Direct Labor costs consist of salaries and wages paid for scientific, technical, and other work performed directly for the contract and pursuant to the contract terms. Labor costs, excluding fringe benefits and overtime premium pay, will be billed as follows:<br />List the titles and amounts for employees whose salaries or wages, or portions thereof, were charged to the contract; show the rate (or hours) worked, and amount for each individual. The cost of direct labor, which is charged directly to the contract, must be supported by time records maintained in the contractor's office.<br />(2) Fringe Benefits<br />If it is the Contractor's established practice to treat fringe benefits as a direct cost, such costs should be billed separately as a single item.<br />NOTE: Fringe benefits, bonuses, etc., are usually treated as indirect costs for inclusion in the overhead pool; however, they may be treated as direct labor costs or as an "Other Direct Charge" if such treatment is in accordance with the Contractor's established accounting procedures.<br />(3) Premium Pay<br />Premium pay is the difference between the rates and amounts paid for overtime or shift work and amount normally paid on a straight time basis. Generally such pay is not included in the direct labor base and should not be included in the billing for "direct labor" unless the Contractor has consistently followed this practice in the past as a matter of policy. Premium pay of any kind unless provided for in the contract must be authorized by the Contracting Officer in advance. Billings for unauthorized premium pays have caused frequent delays in payment due to suspensions and exchange of correspondence. Citations of authorization for premium pay will avoid delays in payment. Authorized premium pay may be shown as a single item on the summary of costs. However, it must be separately itemized for each position, or job category, showing the amount, and a citation of the Contracting Officer's letter of authorization on the continuation sheet of the invoice or voucher.<br />(4) Materials and Supplies<br />Only those items, which the Contractor normally treats as "direct costs", should be claimed under this heading. Major classifications of material only should be billed separately under appropriate classification. Items costing less than $25.00 may be listed by category of materials or supplies. Show the description and dollar amount of individual classifications. All such charges must be supported by the Contractor's office records.<br />(5) Travel<br />When authorized in the contract as a direct cost, travel costs that are directly related to specific contract performance may be billed as a direct cost in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) rates. <br />Travel cost detail should show:<br />(a) Name of traveler and official title,<br />(b) Purpose of trip,<br />(c) Dates of departure and return to starting point (station or airport),<br />(d) Transportation costs, identified as to rail, air, private automobile (including mileage and rate) and taxi.<br />e) If claim for subsistence is on per diem basis, show number of days, rate and amount, as authorized in contract. If claim is based on actual cost of subsistence, show, on a daily basis, the amounts claimed for lodging and meals separately. Reference to Contracting Officer's letter of authorization if required by contract.<br />(6) Consultant Fees<br />Identify the consultant by name, number of days utilized, and amount of fee.<br />(7) Equipment<br />Nonexpendable personal property must be specifically approved in writing by the Contracting Officer or authorized by the terms of the contract. Billing data should include a description of item; make model, quantity, unit cost, total cost, and date approved by the Contracting Officer, if applicable. A copy of the vendor's bill may be submitted in lieu of the identifying information.<br />.<br />QUICK CHECKLIST FOR INVOICE SUBMISSION:<br />1. Standard Form 1035 recommended. If submitting own forms, statement must conform to billing instructions<br />2. Quarterly billing as a minimum <br />3. Invoice contain the minimum requirements per Invoice Submission clause per Section G of the contract<br />4. Vouchers should be collated<br />5.

<p>(i) Air travel shall be by the most direct route using "air coach" or "air tourist" (less than first class) unless it is clearly unreasonable or impractical (e.g., not available for reasons other than avoidable delay in making reservations, would require circuitous routing or entail additional expense offsetting the savings on fare, or would not make necessary connections).</p>

The Contracting Officer may also request the Contractor to immediately remove any contract employee from the on-site facility should it be determined that the individuals are being assigned to duty who have been disqualified for suitability reasons, or who are found to be unfit for performing duties during their tour(s) of duty. Contract employees who are requested to be removed from the on-site facility are required to leave the work site immediately.<br />The Contracting Officer will make all determinations regarding the removal of any contract employee from the on-site facility, except under certain conditions. When a Contracting Officer is not available, either during the day or after normal business hours, or in situations where a delay would not be in the best interest of the Government, or a potential threat to the health, safety, security, general well-being or operational mission of the facility and its population, the Project Officer will have the authority to direct immediate removal of the contractor employee from the on-site facility.

<p>H.9 Non-Disclosure Agreement for Contractor and Contractor Employees (Mar 2006)</p>
<p>Non-Disclosure Agreements for Contractor and Contractor Employees - Mar 2006<br />(a) The contractor shall prepare and submit a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to the Contracting Officer prior to access of government information or the commencement of work at CDC. <br />(b) The NDA made part of this clause, exhibit I and II , is required in service contracts where positions and/or functions proposed to be filled by contractor's employees will have access to non-public and procurement-sensitive information. The NDA also requires contractor's employees properly identify themselves as employees of a contractor when communicating or interacting with CDC employees, employees of other governmental entities (when communication or interaction relates to the contractor's work with the CDC), and members of the public. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.114 (c), states "All contractor personnel attending meetings, answering Government telephones, and working in other situations where their contractor status is not obvious to third parties are required to identify themselves as such to avoid creating an impression in the minds of members of the public or Congress that they are Government officials, unless, in the judgment of the agency, no harm can come from failing to identify themselves. They must also ensure that all documents or reports produced by contractors are suitably marked as contractor products or that contractor participation is appropriately disclosed."<br />(c) The Contractor shall inform employees of the identification requirements by which they must abide and monitor employee compliance with the identification requirements.<br />(d) During the contract performance period, the Contractor is responsible to ensure that all additional or replacement contractors' employees sign a NDA and it is submitted to the Contracting Officer prior to commencement of their work with the CDC.<br />(e) Contractor employees in designated positions or functions that have not signed the appropriate NDA shall not have access to any non-public, procurement sensitive information or participate in government meeting where sensitive information may be discussed. <br />(f) The Contractor shall prepare and maintain a current list of employees working under NDAs and submit to the Contracting Officer upon request during the contract period of performance. The list should at a minimum include: contract number, employee's name, position, date of hire and NDA requirement.</p>
<p>EXHIBIT I<br />Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <br />Contractor Non-Disclosure Agreement</p>
<p>I. Non-public Information<br /><br />[Name of contractor] understands that in order to fulfill the responsibilities pursuant to [Contract name and number] between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and [Name of CDC contractor] dated [date], employees of [contractor] will have access to non-public information, including confidential and privileged information contained in government-owned information technology systems. For purposes of this agreement, confidential information means government information that is not or will not be generally available to the public. Privileged information means information which cannot be disclosed without the prior written consent of the CDC. <br /><br />In order to properly safeguard non-public information, [contractor] agrees to ensure that prior to being granted access to government information or the commencement of work for the CDC, whichever is applicable, all employees will sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) provided by the CDC prior to beginning work for the CDC. Contractor agrees to submit to the contracting official the original signed copies of NDAs signed by the contractor's employees in accordance with the instructions provided by the contracting official. Failure to provide signed NDAs in accordance with this agreement and instructions provided by the contracting official could delay or prevent the employee from commencing or continuing work at the CDC until such agreement is signed and returned to the contracting official. <br /><br />Contractor further agrees that it will not cause or encourage any employee to disclose, publish, divulge, release, or make known in any manner or to any extent, to any individual other than an authorized Government employee any non-public information that the employee may obtain in connection with the performance of the employee's responsibilities to the CDC. <br /><br />II. Procurement-Sensitive Information<br /><br />Contractor further agrees that it will not cause or encourage any employee to disclose, publish, divulge, release, or make known in any manner or to any extent, to any individual, other than an authorized Government employee, any procurement-sensitive information gained while in connection with fulfilling the employee's responsibilities at the CDC. For purposes of this agreement, procurement-sensitive information includes, but is not limited to, all information in Statements of Work (SOW), Requests for Contract (RFC), and Requests for Proposal (RFP); Responses to RFPs, including questions from potential offerors; non-public information regarding procurements; all documents, conversations, discussions, data, correspondence, electronic mail (e-mail), presentations, or any other written or verbal communications relating to, concerning, or affecting proposed or pending solicitations or awards; procurement data; contract information plans; strategies; source selection information and documentation; offerors' identities; technical and cost data; the identity of government personal involved in the solicitation; the schedule of key technical and procurement events in the award determination process; and any other information that may provide an unfair competitive advantage to a contractor or potential contractor if improperly disclosed to them, or any of their employees. <br /><br />Contractor understands and agrees that employee access to any procurement-sensitive information may create a conflict of interest which will preclude contractor from becoming a competitor for any acquisition(s) resulting from this information. Therefore, if an employee participates in any discussions relating to procurement-sensitive information, assists in developing any procurement-sensitive information, or otherwise obtains any procurement-sensitive information during the course of performing duties at the CDC, contractor understands and agrees that contractor are be excluded from competing for any acquisition(s) resulting from this information.</p>
<p>III. Identification of Non-Government Employees<br /><br />Contractor understands that its employees are not agents of the Government. Therefore, unless otherwise directed in writing by the CDC, contractor agrees to assist and monitor employee compliance with the following identification procedures: <br /><br />A. At the beginning of interactions with CDC employees, employees of other governmental entities, members of the public, or the media (when such communication or interaction relates to the contractor's work with the CDC), contractors' employees will identify themselves as an employee of a contractor. <br />B. Contractors' employees will include the following disclosures in all written communications, including outgoing electronic mail (e-mail) messages, in connection with contractual duties to the CDC:<br />Employee's name<br />Name of contractor<br />Center or office affiliation<br />Centers for Disease Control and Prevention<br />C.

The Contractor shall ensure all its subcontractors which perform work under this contract (at all tiers) comply with the above requirements.<br />H.13 Smoke Free Environment Certification (Sep 2008)</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognizes that secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure poses serious health risks to nonsmokers. SHS exposure in the workplace has been linked to an increased risk for heart disease and lung cancer among adult nonsmokers. SHS has been designated as a known carcinogen (cancer-causing agent) by the National Toxicology Program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has concluded that SHS is an occupational carcinogen. There is no risk-free level of SHS exposure. Separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate this exposure. SHS is an important preventable cause of death from cancer and other illnesses, and many Americans, both adults and children, remain at significant risk from SHS exposure.</p>
<p>It is the CDC's intent to protect the health of all CDC employees and reduce cancer and other serious health hazards caused by SHS exposure. Therefore, all meetings and conferences organized and/or sponsored or co-sponsored by the CDC shall be held in a conference venue that provides a smoke-free environment. A smoke-free conference venue is defined as a venue that makes ALL public places in the hotel and in all meeting facilities smoke-free. This includes, but is not limited to, meeting rooms, common areas such as lobbies and hallways, all indoor public spaces, all indoor employee work areas, restaurants (including restaurant bar areas), and lounges.</p>
<p>Conferences include symposia, seminars, workshops, and any other organized and formal meeting lasting one or more days, where CDC personnel assemble to exchange information and views or explore or clarify a defined subject, problem, or area of knowledge.<br />CERTIFICATION: Offeror's acceptance of any resulting contract certifies that the meeting/conference venue provided is "smoke-free" and that all CDC personnel attending said meeting/conference will be doing so in a smoke-free environment.<br />The Contractor shall use FIPS 140-2 (as amended) compliant encryption to protect all instances of HHS sensitive information during storage and transmission. <br />7. The Contractor shall verify that the selected encryption product has been validated under the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/) to confirm compliance with FIPS 140-2 (as amended). The Contractor shall provide a written copy of the validation documentation to both the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).<br />8. The Contractor shall use the Key Management Key on the HHS personal identification verification (PIV) card; or alternatively, the Contractor shall establish and use a key recovery mechanism to ensure the ability for authorized personnel to decrypt and recover all encrypted information.<br />9. The Contractor shall securely generate and manage encryption keys to prevent unauthorized decryption of information, in accordance with FIPS 140-2 (as amended).<br />10. The Contractor shall: ensure that this standard is incorporated into the Contractor's property management/control system; or establish a procedure to account for all laptop computers, desktop computers, and other mobile devices and portable media that store or process sensitive HHS information.<br />The Contractor shall ensure that all of its employees, subcontractors (at all tiers), and employees of each subcontractor, who perform work under this contract/subcontract, comply with the above requirements.<br />H.14 Section 508 Accessibility Compliance<br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services.<br />There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Board's Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Board's standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR).<br />Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. All contractors (including subcontractors1) or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and where applicable, those set forth in the referenced policy or standards documents below. Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW or PWS, shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material.<br />The following Section 508 provisions apply to the content or communications material identified in this SOW/ PWS: Access Board Final Rule 36 CFR Part 1194.21.,22., 31., and 41.<br />Documents must be in unlocked form. Acceptance checklists for various file formats are available at http://www.hhs.gov/web/508/index.html. <br />(End of Clause)<br />H.15 Prohibition of Food, Meals and Light Refreshments<br />The inclusion of food, meals, beverages or light refreshments is expressly prohibited in the performance of this contract and is considered an unallowable contract expense. This prohibition on the inclusion of food shall be flowed down and included in all subcontracts, purchase orders, and agreements issued in the performance of this contract. Food and meals may not be accepted and shall not be provided even if offered at no additional cost to CDC.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>H.16 Year 2000 Compliance (07/1999)<br />Unless elsewhere exempted, information technology (if any) to be acquired under this contract/purchase order, which will be required to perform data time processing involving dates subsequent to December 31, 1999, shall be Year 2000 compliant as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 39.002.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

These liabilities must arise out of the performance of this contract, whether or not caused by the negligence of the Contractor or the Contractor's agents, servants, or employees, and must be represented by final judgments or settlements approved in writing by the Government. These liabilities are for-<br />(i) Loss of or damage to property (other than property owned, occupied, or used by the Contractor, rented to the Contractor, or in the care, custody, or control of the Contractor); or<br />(ii) Death or bodily injury.<br />(d) The Government's liability under paragraph (c) of this clause is limited to the amounts reflected in final judgments, or settlements approved in writing by the Government, but in no event to exceed the funds available under the Limitation of Cost or Limitation of Funds clause of this contract. Nothing in this contract shall be construed as implying that, at a later date, the Government will request, or the Congress will appropriate, funds sufficient to meet any deficiencies.<br />(e) The Government shall not reimburse the Contractor for liabilities (and expenses incidental to such liabilities)-<br />(1) For which the Contractor is otherwise responsible under the express terms of any clause specified in the Schedule or elsewhere in the contract;<br />(2) For which the Contractor has failed to insure or to maintain insurance as required by the Contracting Officer; or<br />(3) That result from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of the Contractor's directors, officers, managers, superintendents, or other representatives who have supervision or direction of -<br />(i) All or substantially all of the Contractor's business;<br />(ii) All or substantially all of the Contractor's operations at any one plant or separate location in which this contract is being performed; or<br />(iii) A separate and complete major industrial operation in connection with the performance of this contract.<br />(f) The provisions of paragraph (e) of this clause shall not restrict the right of the Contractor to be reimbursed for the cost of insurance maintained by the Contractor in connection with the performance of this contract, other than insurance required in accordance with this clause; provided, that such cost is allowable under the Allowable Cost and Payment clause of this contract.<br />(g) If any suit or action is filed or any claim is made against the Contractor, the cost and expense of which may be reimbursable to the Contractor under this contract, and the risk of which is then uninsured or is insured for less than the amount claimed, the Contractor shall-<br />(1) Immediately notify the Contracting Officer and promptly furnish copies of all pertinent papers received;<br />(2) Authorize Government representatives to collaborate with counsel for the insurance carrier in settling or defending the claim when the amount of the liability claimed exceeds the amount of coverage; and<br />(3) Authorize Government representatives to settle or defend the claim and to represent the Contractor in or to take charge of any litigation, if required by the Government, when the liability is not insured or covered by the bond. The Contractor may, at its own expense, be associated with the Government representatives in any such claim or litigation.<br />(End of clause)<br />Alternate I (April 1984).

The Contractor shall be reimbursed for the cost of such insurance and, to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, for liabilities to third persons for which the Contractor has obtained insurance coverage as provided in this paragraph, but for which such coverage is insufficient in amount.<br />(End of clause)<br />Alternate II (April 1984). If the successful offeror represents in its offer that it is totally immune from tort liability as a State agency, the Contracting Officer shall substitute the following paragraphs (a) and (b) for paragraphs (a) and (b) of the basic clause:<br />(a) The Government does not assume any liability to third persons, nor will the Government reimburse the Contractor for its liability to third persons, with respect to loss due to death, bodily injury, or damage to property resulting in any way from the performance of this contract or any subcontract under this contract.<br />(b) If any suit or action is filed, or if any claim is made against the Contractor, the cost and expense of which may be reimbursable to the Contractor under this contract, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and promptly furnish copies of all pertinent papers received by the Contractor. The Contractor shall, if Government requires, authorize Government representatives to settle or defend the claim and to represent the Contractor in or take charge of any litigation. The Contractor may, at its own expense, be associated with the Government representatives in any such claims or litigation.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>I.17 HHSAR 352.231-70 Salary Rate Limitation (Jan 2010)</p>
<p>(a) Pursuant to the current and applicable prior HHS appropriations acts, the Contractor shall not use contract funds to pay the direct salary of an individual at a rate in excess of the Federal Executive Schedule Level I in effect on the date an expense is incurred.<br /><br />(b) For purposes of the salary rate limitation, the terms ``direct salary,'' ``salary,'' and ``institutional base salary'' <br />have the same meaning and are collectively referred to as ``direct salary'' in this clause. An individual's direct salary is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an individual's direct effort (costs) under the contract. Direct salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor. Direct salary also excludes fringe benefits, overhead, and general and administrative expenses (also referred to as indirect costs or facilities and administrative [F&amp;A] costs).</p>
<p>Note: The salary rate limitation does not restrict the salary that an organization may pay an individual working under an HHS contract or order; it merely limits the portion of that salary that may be paid with Federal funds.</p>
<p>(c) The salary rate limitation also applies to individuals under subcontracts. If this is a multiple-year contract or order, it may be subject to unilateral modification by the Contracting Officer to ensure that an individual is not paid at a rate that exceeds the salary rate limitation provision established in the HHS appropriations act in effect when the expense is incurred regardless of the rate initially used to establish contract or order funding.</p>
<p>(d) See the salaries and wages pay tables on the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Web site for Federal Executive Schedule salary levels that apply to the current and prior periods.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />I.18 HHSAR 352.233-71 Litigation and Claims (Jan 2006)</p>

Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/standards.htm.<br />(c) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are identified in the Statement of Work/Specification/Performance Work Statement. In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 accessibility standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Evaluation Template may be found under Section 508 policy on the HHS Office on Disability website (http://www.hhs.gov/od/).<br />(d) Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 accessibility standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government - i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor and at its expense.<br />(End of provision)<br />I.22 HHSAR 352.242-71 Tobacco-Free Facilities (Jan 2006)</p>

The Contractor is not required to continue work on those items beyond that point. The Government shall not be required in any event to pay the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those items notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the clause entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government."

<p><br />Section M - Evaluation Factors For Award <br /><br />FAR SOURCE TITLE AND DATE<br />M.1 52.217-5 Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990)</p>
<p>Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>M.2 Past Performance Evaluation (Adjectival Rating System) (Jan 2000)</p>
<p>Past performance information will be evaluated in the following manner:<br /><br />(a) Each offeror shall be evaluated on its past performance under current and prior contracts performed within the last five years. By past performance, the Government means the offeror's record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of forecasting and controlling costs; field data collection; survey participant response rate; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules and terms, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reporting and project management; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer and the degree of quality of deliverables and performance.<br /><br />(b) The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance for health data collection services similar to the size and complexity of the NHANES program. Vendors must demonstrate experience in their proposed technical approach.<br /><br />(End of Provision)<br /><br />M.3 Technical Strength More Important than Cost/Price (Jan 2000)</p>
<p>Offerors are advised that in proposal evaluation paramount consideration will be given to technical proposals rather than to cost or price unless, as a result of technical evaluations, proposals are judged to be essentially equal, in which case cost or price shall become the determining factor. In turn, where the Government determines competing proposals to be essentially equal (based on both technical merit and cost/price), past performance will become the deciding factor in making the source selection for award. A cost analysis will be performed on the cost proposal. Additionally, cost/price will be evaluated on the basis of cost realism which is defined as the offeror's ability to project costs which are reasonable and indicate that the offeror understands the nature and extent of the work to be performed.</p>
<p>Discussions, if held, will be conducted only with those offerors determined to be within the competitive range.</p>
<p>Award shall be made to that responsible offeror submitting the proposal (cost and non-cost factors) determined to be the most advantageous and the best value to the Government as evaluated under the criteria described in this Section.</p>
<p>(End of Clause</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />M.4 Basis for Award</p>
<p>Offerors are advised that award will be made to that offeror whose proposal provides the combination of features that offers the best overall value to the Government. In accordance with FAR 15.101-1, the tradeoff process will be used by the Government to consider awards to other than the lowest priced offer or other than the highest technically rated offer. This process will permit the Government to make trade off among costs or price and non-cost factors and allow the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal. In making this determination, the Government is more concerned with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than lowest overall cost, however, the government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance. Overall cost to the Government may become the ultimate determining factor in contract award as proposals become more equal based on the other factors, notwithstanding the information relative to past performance stated under M.1.</p>

<p>QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP)</p>
<p><br />1.0 Introduction</p>
<p>1.1 Since this is a Performance-Based Contract, the Government must effectively validate in a timely manner the performance of the Contractor in meeting the services required. This QASP provides a systematic surveillance method for the services, and describes the methodology by which the Contractor's performance will be monitored.</p>
<p>1.2 The principal focus of the surveillance system is the Contractor's performance in providing the services identified in the Performance-based Matrix. The CPARS contractor performance assessment addresses the following areas: Quality of Product or Services, Schedule, Cost Control, Business Relations, Management of Key Personnel, Utilization of Small Business, and Other Areas. These Other Areas may address the indicators identified in the Performance-Based Matrix at paragraph C.6 of the Performance Based Performance Work Statement (PBPWS). Therefore, the QASP surveillance standards are identical to those in paragraph VI. See Attachment 1 for a description of CPARS Ratings.</p>
<p>1.3 The task order will be surveilled with this Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP).</p>
<p>1.4 The plan will use the Contractors Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to electronically process interim and final contractor performance assessments at www.cpars.gov. At a minimum, interim contractor performance assessments will be conducted every 12 months until the end of the contract. CPARS allows the Contracting Officer's Representative or Contracting Officer, to report Contractor and subcontractor performance on a national, easily accessible database. It requires the Contracting Officer to review the database prior to approving the use of a Contractor to insure that the Contractor or subcontractor has done a good job in the past. As a result, it is anticipated that CPARS should help motivate the Contractor, wishing future work in the Federal sector, on the current contract toward superior performance.</p>
<p>1.5 For the purpose of this plan, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consider the FAR Clause 52.246-4 Inspection of Services -Fixed-Price and FAR Clause 52.246-5 Inspection of Services-Cost-Reimbursement to meet the FAR Part 37.601 criteria for establishing a procedure for reduction of price or fee of a contract.</p>
<p>1.6 This QASP:</p>
<p>1.6.1 Identifies the service and products that will be measured.<br />1.6.2 Establishes the specific standards of performance for each required output.<br />1.6.3 Establishes the responsibilities for performing the measurement.<br />1.6.4 Defines the Government role in overseeing the performance.<br />1.6.5 Provides for feedback to the Contractor regarding quality, quantity, and timeliness of the service outputs.<br />1.6.6 Establishes timeframes for communicating performance improvements</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.0 Methods of Surveillance:</p>
<p>2.1 The Performance-Based Matrix at paragraph C.6 lists the services to be monitored and the standards to be applied.</p>
<p>2.2 This QASP is based on the premise the government desires to maintain a quality standard for publication and dissemination technical support services.</p>
<p>2.3 The Contractor, and not the government, is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. The role of the government is quality assurance to ensure contract standards are achieved.</p>
<p>2.4 In this contract the Contractor quality control program is the basis for service quality. The Contractor is required to only deliver publication and dissemination technical support services that conform to the requirements of the contract.</p>
<p>3.0 Roles and Responsibilities:</p>
<p>3.1 The Contractor's primary responsibility is to ensure all requirements are met at the required quality level. The Government shall ensure this responsibility has been met before payment is made to the Contractor. The primary Government team members are the Contracting Officers Representative (COR), Technical Monitor (TM), and the Contracting Officer (CO).</p>
<p>3.2 The CO has the overall responsibility for overseeing the Contractor's performance. The CO is responsible for monitoring Contractor performance in the areas of contract compliance, contract management, and the resolution of all issues relative to the language of the contract.</p>
<p>3.3 The COR is responsible for directly monitoring, assessing, recording, and reporting on the technical performance of the Contractor. The COR will have primary responsibility for signing off on all invoices and documenting the inspection and evaluation of the Contractor's performance.</p>
<p>3.4 The COR will work with staff and the Contractor to ensure good communication and resolve any problems not requiring the CO's authority.</p>
<p>4.0 Surveillance: The COR will evaluate the performance objectives through periodic inspections during each service month. See Attachment 2 for a sample of a COR Monthly Evaluation Report.</p>
<p>4.1 The following information will be included:<br />4.1.1 Contract paragraph number referencing the requirement.<br />4.1.2 A short description of the requirement being surveilled.<br />4.1.3 Date, time, and location of surveillance.<br />4.1.4 Results of surveillance.<br />4.1.5 Signature of individual accomplishing the surveillance.</p>
<p>4.2 All performance must be documented, whether acceptable or unacceptable. When unacceptable performance is documented, the COR shall take the following actions:<br />4.2.1 If government actions caused the unacceptable performance, take steps to prevent it in the future.<br />4.2.2 If the Contractor's performance is unacceptable, inform the Contractor's on site representative of the unacceptable performance and the reasons why it is unacceptable.<br />4.2.3 If the contractor wants to dispute the results of the surveillance, refer them to the CO for resolution.</p>
<p>4.3 Performance should not be determined unacceptable until all possible contributing factors have been considered.</p>
<p>4.4 For required tasks not shown on the Performance-Based Matrix, the government still retains the right to inspect any item included in the contract. These services will be inspected periodically and the results provided to the CO.</p>
<p>5.0 Standards: All standards in the Performance-Based Matrix must be met. All deliverable dates and other contractual completion dates must also be met. If any of the standards are not met, the Government shall receive consideration from the Contractor for breach of contract.</p>
<p>5.1 Late performance is un-excusable unless the Contractor can justify all of the following:<br />5.1.1 The delay was not the Contractor's fault.<br />5.1.2 The delay was not forseeable.<br />5.1.3 It was beyond the Contractor's control to avoid the delay.</p>
<p>5.2 All work shall be performed in accordance with the PBPWS. The COR shall not consider the services complete until all deficiencies have been corrected.<br />5.3 The COR shall determine whether the failure was a minor non-conformance or a substantive non-conformance. (See Attachment 4 for the decision matrix on non-conforming deliverables.)</p>
<p>6.0 Procedures: The Government will inspect performance requirements to ensure contractor compliance and record results of inspection, noting the date and time of inspection. Unacceptable performance and complaints shall be referred to the CO for investigation and validation. The CO will investigate and validate the unacceptable performance and/or customer input. The Contractor shall be given a reasonable amount of time after notification to correct the unacceptable performance and report to the CO that the deficiency has been corrected. If deficiencies are not corrected, the COR will notify the CO and recommend a course of action.</p>
<p>7.0 Contract Performance Evaluation</p>
<p>7.1 FAR subpart 42.15 - Contractor Performance Information establishes the Government responsibility for recording and maintaining contractor performance information. This requirement does not apply to procedures used in determining incentive awards or other incentive systems, although the two systems should be mutually supporting.</p>
<p>7.2 FAR subpart 42.1501 - Past Performance Information is relevant information for future source selection purposes, regarding a contractor's actions under previously awarded contracts. It includes, for example, the contractor's record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good workmanship; the contractor's record of forecasting and controlling costs; the contractor's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative specs of performance; the contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the contractor's business-like concern for the interest of their customers.</p>
<p>7.3 The general procedures to be used are addressed in the following FAR section. All contractor performance assessments will be initiated and processed through CPARS.</p>
<p>42.1503 Procedures:<br />(a) Agency procedures for the past performance evaluation system shall generally provide for input to the evaluations from the technical office, contracting office and, where appropriate, end users of the product or service. (b) Agency evaluations of contractor performance prepared under this subpart shall be provided to the contractor as soon as practicable after completion of the evaluation. Contractors shall be given a minimum of 30 days to submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional information. Agencies shall provide for review at a level above the CO to consider disagreements between the parties regarding the evaluation. The ultimate conclusion on the performance evaluation is a decision of the contracting agency. Copies of the evaluation, contractor response, and review comments, if any, shall be retained as part of the evaluation. These evaluations may be used to support future award decisions, and should therefore be marked "Source Selection Information".</p>
<p>7.4 The CPARS contractor performance assessment will be completed at least annually and more frequently if necessary to motivate or reward the contractor.</p>

<p>2. As prescribed in 46.304, insert the following clause:52.246-4<br />Inspection of Services - Fixed-Price (Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition: "Services," as used in this clause, includes services performed, workmanship, and material furnished or utilized in the performance of services.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering the services under this contract. Complete records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor shall be maintained and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all services called for by the contract, to the extent practicable at all times and places during the term of the contract. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspections or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.<br />(e) If any of the services do not conform to contract requirements, the Government may require the Contractor to perform the services again in conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount. When the defects in services cannot be corrected by reperformance, the Government may -<br />(1) Require the Contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements; and<br />(2) Reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.<br />(f) If the Contractor fails to promptly perform the services again or to take the necessary action to ensure future performance in conformity with contract requirements, the Government may -<br />(1) By contract or otherwise, perform the services and charge to the Contractor any cost incurred by the Government that is directly related to the performance of such service; or<br />(2) Terminate the contract for default.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>3. Payment is linked to quality through FAR 52.246-5 Inspection of Services-Cost-Reimbursement. <br />As prescribed in 46.305, insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts for services, or supplies that involve the furnishing of services, when a cost-reimbursement contract is contemplated: <br />Inspection of Services-Cost-Reimbursement (Apr 1984) <br />(a) Definition. "Services," as used in this clause, includes services performed, workmanship, and material furnished or used in performing services. <br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering the services under this contract. Complete records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor shall be maintained and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. <br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all services called for by the contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times during the term of the contract. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. <br />(d) If any of the services performed do not conform with contract requirements, the Government may require the Contractor to perform the services again in conformity with contract requirements, for no additional fee. When the defects in services cannot be corrected by re-performance, the Government may- <br />(1) Require the Contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements; and <br />(2) Reduce any fee payable under the contract to reflect the reduced value of the services performed. <br />(e) If the Contractor fails to promptly perform the services again or take the action necessary to ensure future performance in conformity with contract requirements, the Government may- <br />(1) By contract or otherwise, perform the services and reduce any fee payable by an amount that is equitable under the circumstances; or <br />(2) Terminate the contract for default. <br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attachment 1</p>
<p>CONTRACTORS PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTING SYSTEM (CPARS) RATINGS</p>
<p>Block 18a - Quality of Product or Service. Assess the Contractor's conformance to contract requirements, specifications and standards of good workmanship (e.g. commonly accepted technical, professional, environmental, or safety and health standards). MANDATORY.<br />&bull; For example: Are reports/data accurate? Does the product or service provided meet the specifications of the contract? Does the Contractor's work measure up to commonly accepted technical or professional standards? Assess the degree of Government technical direction required to solve problems that arise during performance. <br />&bull; For Operations Support: Assess how successfully the Contractor meets program quality objectives such as ability to produce, reliability, maintainability and ability to inspect. The Assessing Official must be flexible in how Contractor success is measured; e.g. using data from field reliability and maintainability and failure reports, user comments and acceptance rates, and scrap and rework rates. These quantitative indicators may be useful later, for example, in source selection evaluations, in demonstrating continuous improvement, quality and reliability leadership that reflects progress in total quality management. Assess the Contractor's control of the overall production process to include material control, shop planning and control, and status.</p>
<p><br />Block 18b - Schedule. Assess the timeliness of the Contractor against the completion of the contract, task orders, milestones, delivery schedules, and administrative requirements (e.g. efforts that contribute to or effect the schedule variance). MANDATORY.<br />&bull; This assessment of the Contractor's adherence to the required delivery schedule should include the Contractor's efforts during the assessment period that contributes to or effect the schedule variance. This element applies to contract closeout activities as well as contract performance. Instances of adverse actions such as the assessment of liquidated damages, or issuance of Cure Notices, Show Cause Notices, and Delinquency Notices are indicators of problems which may have resulted in variance to the contract schedule and should therefore be noted in the evaluation.</p>
<p><br />Block 18c - Cost Control (Not required for Firm Fixed Price or Firm Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment). Assess the Contractor's effectiveness in forecasting, managing, and controlling contract cost. MANDATORY.<br />&bull; For example, does the Contractor keep within the total estimated cost (what is the relationship of the negotiated costs and budgeted costs to actuals)? Did the Contractor do anything innovative that resulted in cost savings? Were billings current, accurate and complete? Are the Contractor's budgetary internal controls adequate?</p>
<p>Block 18d - Business Relations. Assess the integration and coordination of all activity needed to execute the contract, specifically the timeliness, completeness and quality of problem identification, corrective action plans, proposal submittals, the contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior (to include timely identification of issues in controversy), customer satisfaction, timely award and management of subcontracts. MANDATORY<br />Include, as applicable, information on the following: <br />&bull; Is the contractor oriented toward the customer? <br />&bull; Is interaction between the contractor and the government satisfactory or does it need improvement? <br />&bull; Include the adequacy of the contractor's accounting, billing, and estimating systems and the contractor's management of Government Property (GFP) if a substantial amount of GFP has been provided to the contractor under the contract. <br />&bull; Address the timeliness of awards to subcontractors and management of subcontractors, including subcontract costs. Consider efforts taken to ensure early identification of subcontract problems and the timely application of corporate resources to preclude subcontract problems from impacting overall prime contractor performance. <br />&bull; Assess the prime contractor's effort devoted to managing subcontracts and whether subcontractors were an integral part of the contractor's team. <br />Block 18e - Management of Key Personnel (For Services and Information Technology Business Sectors only - Not Applicable to Operations Support).. Assess the Contractor's performance in selecting, retaining, supporting, and replacing, when necessary, key personnel. MANDATORY.<br />&bull; For example, how well did the Contractor match the qualifications of the key position, as described in the contract, with the person who filled the key position? Did the Contractor support key personnel so they were able to work effectively? If a key person did not perform well, what action was taken by the Contractor to correct this? If a replacement of a key person was necessary, did the replacement meet or exceed the qualifications of the position as described in the contract schedule?</p>
<p>Block 18f - Utilization of Small Business. FAR Subpart 19.7 and 15 U.S.C. 637 contains statutory requirements for complying with the Small Business Subcontracting Program. Assess whether the contractor provided maximum practicable opportunity for Small Business (including Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) and Indian Tribes) (including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (which also includes ANCs and Indian Tribes), Women Owned Small Businesses, HUBZone, Veteran Owned, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Historically Black Colleges and Minority Institutions and ANCs and Indian Tribes that are not Small Disadvantaged Businesses or Small Businesses) to participate in contract performance consistent with efficient performance of the contract.<br />Assess compliance with all terms and conditions in the contract relating to Small Business participation (including FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Businesses and FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan (when required). Assess any small business participation goals which are stated separately in the contract. Assess achievement on each individual goal stated within the contract or subcontracting plan including good faith effort if the goal was not achieved.<br />It may be necessary to seek input from the Small Business specialist, ACO or PCO in regards to the contractor's compliance with these criteria. For DoD in cases where the contractor has a comprehensive subcontracting plan, request DCMA Comprehensive Subcontracting Plan Manager to provide input including any program specific performance information.<br />For contracts subject to a commercial subcontracting plan, the Utilization of Small Business factor should be rated "satisfactory" as long as an approved plan remains in place, unless liquidated damages have been assessed by the contracting officer who approved the commercial plan (see FAR 19.705-7(h)). In such case, the Utilization of Small Business area must be rated "unsatisfactory".<br />This area must be rated for all contracts and task orders that contain a small business subcontracting goal.<br />Ratings for the Utilization of Small Business evaluation area will be in accordance with the definitions described below. Ratings for the other CPAR evaluation areas will be in accordance with the ratings described in Block 18 Evaluation Areas.<br />In accordance FAR 19.705-2(e) a contract may have no more than one subcontracting plan. Evaluations of the Utilization of Small Business are required for contracts and orders placed against basic ordering agreement (BOA) and blanket purchase agreement (BPA) if a subcontracting plan is required. Evaluations of Utilization of Small Business for single-agency task orders and delivery orders (to include FSS) are not required and shall not be accomplished unless the contracting officer determines that such evaluations would produce more useful past performance information for source selection officials than that contained in the overall contract evaluation. Execution of any subcontracting plan may be addressed in block 20.<br />&bull; Exceptional. Exceeded all negotiated subcontracting goals or exceeded at least one goal and met all of the other negotiated subcontracting goals for the current period. Had exceptional success with initiatives to assist, promote, and utilize small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business (VOSB) and service disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB). Complied with FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns. Exceeded any other small business participation requirements incorporated in the contract, including the use of small businesses in mission critical aspects of the program. Went above and beyond the required elements of the subcontracting plan and other small business requirements of the contract. Completed and submitted Individual Subcontract Reports and/or Summary Subcontract Reports in an accurate and timely manner. <br />Note: To justify an Exceptional rating, identify multiple significant events and state how they were a benefit to small business utilization. A singular benefit, however, could be of such magnitude that it constitutes an Exceptional rating. Ensure that small businesses are given meaningful, innovative work directly related to the project, rather than peripheral work, such as cleaning offices, supplies, landscaping, etc. Also, there should have been no significant weaknesses identified.<br />&bull; Very Good. Met all of the negotiated subcontracting goals in the traditional socio-economic categories (SB, SDB and WOSB) and met at least one of the other socio-economic goals (HUBZone, VOSB, SDVOSB) for the current period. Had significant success with initiatives to assist, promote and utilize SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB. Complied with FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns. Met or exceeded any other small business participation requirements incorporated in the contract, including the use of small businesses in mission critical aspects of the program. Endeavored to go above and beyond the required elements of the subcontracting plan. Completed and submitted Individual Subcontract Reports and/or Summary Subcontract Reports in an accurate and timely manner. <br />Note: To justify a Very Good rating, identify a significant event and state how they were a benefit to small business utilization. Ensure that small businesses are given meaningful, innovative work directly related to the project, rather than peripheral work, such as cleaning offices, supplies, landscaping, etc. There should be no significant weaknesses identified.<br />&bull; Satisfactory. Demonstrated a good faith effort to meet all of the negotiated subcontracting goals in the various socio-economic categories for the current period. Complied with FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns. Met any other small business participation requirements included in the contract. Fulfilled the requirements of the subcontracting plan included in the contract. Completed and submitted Individual Subcontract Reports and/or Summary Subcontract Reports in an accurate and timely manner. <br />Note: To justify a Satisfactory rating, there should have been only minor problems, or major problems the contractor has addressed or taken corrective action. There should have been no significant weaknesses identified. A fundamental principle of assigning ratings is that contractors will not be assessed a rating lower than Satisfactory solely for not performing beyond the requirements of the contract.<br />&bull; Marginal. Deficient in meeting key subcontracting plan elements. Deficient in complying with FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns, and any other small business participation requirements in the contract. Did not submit Individual Subcontract Reports and/or Summary Subcontract Reports in an accurate or timely manner. Failed to satisfy one or more requirements of a corrective action plan currently in place; however, does show an interest in bringing performance to a satisfactory level and has demonstrated a commitment to apply the necessary resources to do so. Required a corrective action plan. <br />Note: To justify Marginal performance, identify a significant event that the contractor had trouble overcoming and how it impacted small business utilization. A Marginal rating should be supported by referencing the actions taken by the government that notified the contractor of the contractual deficiency.<br />&bull; Unsatisfactory. Noncompliant with FAR 52.219-8 and 52.219-9 and any other small business participation requirements in the contract. Did not submit Individual Subcontract Reports and/or Summary Subcontract Reports in an accurate or timely manner. Showed little interest in bringing performance to a satisfactory level or is generally uncooperative. Required a corrective action plan. <br />Note: To justify an Unsatisfactory rating, identify multiple significant events that the contractor had trouble overcoming and state how it impacted small business utilization. A singular problem, however, could be of such serious magnitude that it alone constitutes an Unsatisfactory rating. An Unsatisfactory rating should be supported by referencing the actions taken by the government to notify the contractor of the deficiencies. When an Unsatisfactory rating is justified, the contracting officer must consider whether the contractor made a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of the subcontracting plan required by FAR 52.219-9 and follow the procedures outlined in FAR 52.219-16, Liquidated Damages-Subcontracting Plan.<br />NOTE 1: Plus or minus signs may be used to indicate an improving (+) or worsening (-) trend insufficient to change assessment status.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: For subcontracting plans under the DoD Comprehensive Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Test Program), DFARS 252.219-7004, the ratings entered in CPARS shall mirror those assigned by the Defense Contract Management Agency who is responsible for monitoring such plans.</p>
<p>NOTE 3: Generally, zero percent is not a goal unless the Contracting Officer determined when negotiating the subcontracting plan that no subcontracting opportunities exist in a particular socio-economic category. In such cases, the contractor shall be considered to have met the goal for any socio-economic category where the goal negotiated in the plan was zero.<br />Block 18g - Other Areas. Specify additional evaluation areas that are unique to the contract, or that cannot be captured elsewhere on the form. More than one type of entry may be included, but should be separately labeled. If extra space is needed, use Block 20.<br />If the contract contains an award fee provision, enter "award fee" in the "Other Areas" block (18g). The Assessing Official should translate the award fee earned to adjective ratings, which could prove more useful for using past performance to assess future performance risk in upcoming source selections. If award fee information is included in the CPAR, use block 20 to provide a description for each award fee. Include the scope of the award fee by describing the extent to which it covers the total range of contract performance activities, or is restricted to certain elements of the contract.<br />If any other type of contract incentive is included in the contract (excluding contract shareline incentives on fixed price or cost-type contracts), it should be reported in a manner similar to the procedures described above for award fee.<br />Use Block 18g in those instances where the Assessing Official believes strongly, either positively or negatively, regarding an aspect of the Contractor's performance, but cannot fit that aspect into any of the other blocks on the form.</p>

All CLINS are procured as a "Job"; however, every vendor MUST provide in its quote the price per room. The "Job" represents the aggregate price for each CLIN. The USG must know exactly the breakdown because each room, for example, has a FFP; however, the final number of total rooms may be less and the USG does not waive any attrition. The attached SOW/PWS and all allied documents are incorporated herein fully.  Location and dates are identified as being mission essential.  The vendor MUST breakdown its pricing for each item listed and any other major item identified in the PWS/SOW.

Each vendor is STRONGLY encouraged to provide the maximum amount of information so that the USG can evaluate the quote. Further, no vendor should insert a link or other embedded information which causes the USG to seek out information relative to the vendor's quote. Rather, each vendor MUST attach or recite its quote, its particulars, and pricing information. The room rate CANNOT exceed the Joint Travel Regulation. This is a FFP contract; however, the USG will ONLY pay for the rooms it uses, the meals it consumes, and whatever goods and services it actually uses.

The successful contractor MUST provide a final accounting at the end of the event to identify the rooms actually used, meals and drinks consumed, travel used, et cet.

This CLIN should cover any miscellenous items not falling under the above major aspects of  this procurment. Because the vendor is required to provide transportation, it is strongly suggested that the hotel be close to the major attractions, International Drive, in Orlando, FLA, et cet.

Failure to be available or failure to meaningfully or substantively address every aspect of this requirement during the 3-way call could cause the vendor's quote to be deemed as unresponsive.

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS<br /><br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-66.
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541519, with size standard of $25.5M.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being procured as a total HUBZone set-aside.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Enterprise Systems Division (ESD) of the Office of Information Systems Management (OISM) at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides an Enterprise Storage Area Network (SAN) for NIST programs. This SAN system provides data storage resources to a wide range of servers and applications including NIST Servers Virtualization project. ESD has the need for two additional SAN storage systems for the Server Virtualization project.</p>
<p>ESD goal is to obtain two storage systems with the ability to implement storage optimization in a virtual environment and are capable of block level data replication between each other. ESD first looked at the underlying technologies that are employed in the industry. The major technologies that drive optimization were tiering and de-duplication. Early on in the evaluation process de-duplication was the most logical choice for an optimization method. This technology allows for the system to only store a block once when there are many identical blocks. In a virtual environment ESD is seeing on average 60% of the blocks are all identical due to the same operating systems and data being stored by each system.</p>
<p>Brand Name or Equal:</p>
<p>Two commercially available SAN Storage systems through a "Brand Name or Equal Specification" justification.</p>
<p>This is a brand name or equal requirement. Brand name or equal description is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive and is to indicate the quality and characteristic of products that will be considered satisfactory to meet the agency's requirement.</p>
<p>ESD evaluated many of the top vendors in the storage market, HP, Dell, NetApp, EMC. The only vendor that provided de-duplication at a block level within the storage unit was NetApp. At this time, Netapp is the only vendor that can optimize at a block level and provide a guaranteed 50% return of the storage capacity using de-duplication optimization. This will result in a substantial return on the investment for the government as it relates to storage optimization and performance.</p>
<p>The ESD has determined through market research that NetApp storage systems produces the only commercially available products that can meet the ESD's minimum requirement stated in the attached Statement of Work (SOW). There are many resellers/vendors that can compete to provide the storage systems, but the storage systems must meet all requirement stated in the SOW.</p>

<p><br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for Waterjet System to be used in the Materials Science and Engineering Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.</p>
<p>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR A SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 13.1 -AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-68.</p>
<p>1352.215-72 INQUIRIES (APR 2010)<br /><br />Offerors must submit all questions concerning this solicitation in writing to Chris Ganey. Questions should be received no later than 7 calendar days after the issuance date of this solicitation.

<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>In accordance with the non-manufacturer rule, the contractor shall be a small business under the applicable size standard and shall provide either its own product or that of another domestic small business manufacturing or processing concern. See FAR 19.102(f) for additional information.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The recently established NIST Center for Automotive Lightweighting (NCAL) is involved in testing sheet metals and alloys for mechanical properties using several different mechanical tests. Because the best sample geometry for test samples is yet to be determined for all but simple uniaxial tests, there is a critical need to fabricate and test many proposed sample designs. Samples are destructively tested and are therefore only good for a one-time use. New samples need to be fabricated, tested and analyzed, then modified based on the test results. Multiple samples of the same alloy and condition, with the same geometry are needed to achieve statistically significant results. The rapid turn-around time to fabricate new modified samples for retesting will greatly enhance the efficiency of NCAL operations. A dedicated waterjet cutting system for fabricating samples will give NCAL this much needed capability.</p>
<p><br />All offerors shall provide a quotation for the following line items:</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is NICHD-13-050 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-68. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 811219 and the business size standard is $19M. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to contract on a sole source basis with Pentair Aquatic Eco-Systems, Inc. - 2395 Apopka Blvd - Apopka, FL 32703 to provide a one year Preventative Maintenance and Service Contract for the mechanical components of four (4) Aquatics Life Support Systems (ALSS). <br />Please see attached <br />This preventative maintenance agreement is required to maintain and protect the mechanical components of the four (4) ALSS at the NIHs Zebrafish Facility. Each ALSS contains pumps, motors, computer controlled frequency drives, mixers, air blowers, ultraviolet sterilizers, dozens of specialized values and miles of PVC pipes. All of these ALSS equipment supports hundreds of thousands of fish that are used to conduct millions of dollars' worth of research across NIH. The ALSS equipment needs manufacturer recommend maintenance (and recommended spare parts) from a trained and certified source who has the skills/expertise and knowledge to carry out this scope of work. Without the proper maintenance and service, the ALSS equipment will not run at peak performance and could potentially fail, requiring costly replacements and threatening the lives of the fish and the security of the research.<br />Pentair Aquatic Eco-Systems is extremely well suited to handle this task. They are experts in designing, building and maintaining this type of equipment. They have established relationship with local technicians near NIH who could respond quickly in the event of an emergency. Pentair also service other aquatic habitats systems on the NIH campus. Thus, they clearly understand the importance and sensitivity of the research that this equipment is used to support. Their experience with aquatic research models also provides them with unique insights into potential problems that could prevent future disasters; things that a traditional mechanical contractor or master plumber might not recognize as a problem for research aquatics. <br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of the 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), FAR 6.302. <br />The offeror must include a completed copy of the provision of FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis. It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate on a sole source basis with BIOBASE Corporation, 100 Cummings Center, Suite 420B, Beverly, Massachusetts 01915, to acquire a renewal of CIT's subscriptions to the following BIOBASE software products and support: (1) Proteome BioKnowledge&reg; Library (BKL) which includes the PROTEOME<sup>TM</sup>, TRANSFAC&reg;, and TRANSPATH&reg; databases; (2) ExPlain<sup>TM</sup> Analysis System; and (3) software maintenance and professional training for these BIOBASE propriety software products. The period of performance shall consist of a Base Period of 12 months with four (4) successive 12-month Option Periods. Since August 2002, NIH has subscribed to these web-based databases that are used by NIH researches to access yeast genomic and protein information. These databases serve as resources to provide data regarding mammalian-specific protein-protein interaction data.
<p>The Proteome BioKnowledge Library consists of six database volumes of biological information about proteins. Each volume focuses on a different organism important in pharmaceutical research. Proteome scientists manually collect and curate the information in each volume that represents thousands of independent research results. The database currently contains information about more than 60,000 scientific references on more than 80,000 proteins, including data on protein classification and function. Subscribers to the database can quickly access available information about proteins of interest and use its search capabilities to reveal biological connections that would otherwise be buried in the scientific literature. Each volume of the database is updated weekly. Volumes continually expand as new content is published. NIH researchers use this tool to analyze current publications regarding yeast, and to validate the results of their research. The information in the BIOBASE Proteome Database includes predicted properties of the Open Reading Frames (that are not available from any other database source) and scientific literature concerning the gene and its product. BIOBASE's ExPlain software product is a gene expression analysis platform that promotes biological interpretation of large-scale data, such as gene expression, proteomics and ChiP - chip data. ExPlain provides the unique ability to generate hypotheses regarding the upstream cause(s) leading to observed gene expression changes. In particular, ExPlain can identify potential therapeutic targets that are not necessarily part of a differentially expressed gene set. The methods used by ExPlain go above and beyond traditional signal transduction and gene regulatory network data expressions by considering the molecular mechanism(s) that could have caused the experimentally observed changes in gene expression. CIT has determined that BIOBASE's Proteome BKL and ExPlain Analysis System, including software maintenance and training support, are the only commercially available software applications that can meet all of the requirements stated above. This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsible and responsive sources may submit descriptive literature fully documenting their software products and support specifications which will be considered by the agency. Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide software products that can fulfill all of the software requirements specified above. Information received in a timely manner will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government to conduct a competition for this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This requirement is being processed for CIT by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). NLM intends to make an award for this commercial item in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web site http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/SAP/sap.htm: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors; 52.212-3, Offeror's Representations and Certifications; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions, and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes. The contractor shall comply with all other applicable Federal, state, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations in effect at time of award.

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D.

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D.

Due to the highly corrosive environment and corrosion repairs being tracked, when manufacturing and replacing these aircraft parts it is a requirement of the United States Coast Guard to apply the best corrosion protection available to minimize the impact corrosion has on its airframes, while reducing the amount of Chromium used during this application.Current priming applications utilize spray equipment and large portions of chromium based primers which qualify to MIL-PRF-23377. These applications require extensive PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) and exposure monitoring for chromium levels. This process has also proven impossible to provide the required uniform mil thickness to the three dimensional aircraft parts and components being manufactured and replaced on the USCG?s airframes. The current spray application also generates excessive waste while only utilizing roughly 30 - 35 percent of the actual material being applied, which equates to 65 - 70 percent wasted material and excessive cost incurred. Excessive dry times are also required for the current process with MIL-PRF-23377 primers taking from 2 - 8 hours to cure before the topcoat or assembly process can take place. SCOPE: The USCG Base Elizabeth City?s, Aviation Logistics Center?s objective is to obtain an Anodic Electro-Coating system capable of applying E-coat meeting the SAE AMS 3144 specification and coating material meeting this specification in the amount one complete system fill. Must be capable of coating parts up to 20x32x36. This system will be a standalone system to be installed at ALC and must include a minimum of 40 hours of operator training, product support for a minimum period of one year and a maintenance manual for the Electro-coat system. The system shall also include a light curtain barrier, and overhead I-beam trolley system. This is a new specification which has been written for use in the aerospace industry, and is a new requirement for ALC on all locally manufactured aircraft parts. The Electro-coat process is different from the typical spray process that is used today in the aerospace industry. It utilizes a tank process that dips parts and components after pretreatment and coats the parts with a chrome free corrosion inhibitive primer. This along with the absence of Chromium minimizes the requirements for PPE and eliminates the exposure monitoring required for the current process. The coating mil thickness is controlled and the process has the ability to coat 3D shaped parts with ease. Material utilization is 98% compared to standard spray primers of 30 - 35%. Also the parts can be handled immediately following application prior to oven cure of 30 minutes at 200F. Once this cure is complete these parts will be ready to continue their flow through the PDM (Programmed Depot Maintenance). <BR> <BR>REQUIREMENTS: Design: The Contractor shall provide a complete design, which is functional, technically accurate, fully detailed, and in conformance with applicable regulations. The Contractor shall perform thorough research and site investigation.  Investigation shall cover all site features that may be affected by the project design.  The Contractor will be held responsible for all costs incurred as a result of any design errors, deficiencies, or inadequacies resulting from the use of inaccurate drawings and/or insufficient research or site investigation.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br /></p>

All CLINS are procured as a "Job"; however, every vendor MUST provide in its quote the price per room. The "Job" represents the aggregate price for each CLIN. The USG must know exactly the breakdown because each room, for example, has a FFP; however, the final number of total rooms may be less and the USG does not waive any attrition. The attached SOW/PWS and all allied documents are incorporated herein fully.  Location and dates are identified as being mission essential.  The vendor MUST breakdown its pricing for each item listed and any other major item identified in the PWS/SOW.  If the Vendor FAILS to provide this breakdown, the USG may deem the quote as unresponsive and that quote may be ignored. Each vendor is STRONGLY encouraged to provide the maximum amount of information so that the USG can evaluate the quote. Further, no vendor should insert a link or other embedded information which causes the USG to seek out information relative to the vendor's quote. Rather, each vendor MUST attach or recite its quote, its particulars, and pricing information. The room rate CANNOT exceed the Joint Travel Regulation. This is a FFP contract; however, the USG will ONLY pay for the rooms it uses, the meals it consumes, and whatever goods and services it actually uses. Therefore, the final price paid by the USG may be less than the original award as there may be some attrition. The successful contractor MUST provide a final accounting at the end of the event to identify the rooms actually used, meals and drinks consumed, travel used, et cet. Each vendor MUST read and address every issue or item in the attached SOW/PWS. Each vendor MUST include all requested attachments in its quote.

NOTICE:  There is NO small business set-aside.  ALL possible vendors are invited to quote, small business, large business, et cet.
This CLIN should cover any miscellenous items not falling under the above major aspects of  this procurment. Because the vendor is required to provide transportation, it is strongly suggested that the hotel be close to the major attractions in the Nashville, TN area. Because this is a large procurement, the contractor must be able to be available for a 3-way call the day this solictiation closes to discuss all aspects of its quote.  Failure to be available or failure to meaningfully or substantively address every aspect of this requirement during the 3-way call could cause the vendor's quote to be deemed as unresponsive.  All eligible sellers have at least 3 full weeks to prepare their quote, attachments, and any other information required to fully inform the USG.  Because child care will be procured seperately, major hotels are invited to quote.  NOTE:  NO CHILD CARE WILL BE PROCURED UNDER THIS SOLICITATION.  CHILD CARE IS PROCURED UNDER A SEPERATE CONTRACT.

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:  Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D.

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.(c) Special rules. <BR> <BR>The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to JERMOND.M.WILLIAMSON@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 0900 Pacific Time(9 A.M) on 7/4/13.</p>

<DESC><p>GENERAL INFORMATION:</p>
<p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND IS BEING USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARKET ANALYSIS ONLY. The Government is seeking industry input to determine the availability of qualified sources with the technical capability to fulfill the Alaska Radar System (ARS) requirement described below. No contract awards will be made from this notice and no solicitation is available on FBO or any other bulletin boards, posting rooms, or clearinghouses at this time. In order to develop a sound acquisition strategy, early industry participation is highly encouraged. Respondents will not be notified of the responses to this notice. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, this notice is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations. Information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary or Confidential" will not be disclosed outside of Government channels. All responses will be used in whole or in part for determining the most effective acquisition strategy for future ARS acquisitions or similar requirements.</p>
<p>SECTION 1 - BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>1.1 The Government has a continuing requirement for non-personal services necessary for the Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) of the ARS. The requirement consists of O&amp;M of 15 geographically separated long-range radar sites (accessible by air and/or seasonal barge), three remote radio sites, and the Maintenance Control and Communications Center (MC3) activities of the Regional Air Operations Center (RAOC) at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska. The radar operations are in direct support of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and the United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) mission for air sovereignty within Alaska and provide civil aircraft information to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This requirement also includes the O&amp;M of facilities, seven (7) gravel airstrips, various beach reinforcement structures, gravel access roads, utilities, water/wastewater systems, power generation, environmental management, snow removal, transportation, weather observation, logistics support, billeting services, dining facility services, and third-party support for other federal and state agencies.</p>
<p>1.2. The ARS requirement is categorized by two distinct NAICS, which are 561210 "Facilities Support Services" and 517919 "All Other Telecommunications". Both industries are critical to the success of the ARS mission and cannot be segregated into separate requirements without unreasonable cost, schedule, and performance risk to the Government. The current ARS contract was awarded on 1 October 2004 for (1) one base year and (9) nine one-year option periods and will expire on 30 September 2014. The current contract was awarded as a Fixed-Price-Award-Fee (FPAF) type contract. The core mission area of this requirement is O&amp;M of long-range radar systems, including all related telecommunications / electronics equipment and subsystems. However, facilities support services represent a greater percentage of relative effort and are critical to the success of the mission.</p>
<p>SECTION 2 - PURPOSE OF SOURCES SOUGHT:</p>
<p>2.1. The Government is seeking industry input from all sources to determine the best acquisition approach to obtain the unique and highly specialized services described in section 1 above. In an effort to maximize competition and broaden industry participation, the Government is implementing an Essential Parts Replacement Program (EPRP) currently led by the Ogden Air Logistics Center at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. Lockheed Martin will be modernizing the 15 AN/FPS-117 long-range surveillance radars in Alaska by upgrading the radars with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components (technology refresh). The EPRP will facilitate future upgrades, which will replace and update all the radars to current commercial technology standards, cost effectively extending their operational lives through 2025. The estimated completion of the EPRP is expected in Fiscal Year 2016.</p>
<p>2.2. The future success of ARS is dependent upon full completion of the EPRP upgrade, including phased-in installation, testing, and government acceptance. Initial installation has begun at specific sites, including training and procurement of test-set equipment in support of the Atmospheric Early Warning System (AEWS) Program. In order to de-conflict the full installation schedule, the Government is anticipating award of the ARS requirement upon full completion of the EPRP install. Awarding this requirement any sooner would result in significant delays in the upgrade and operability of the radar system.</p>
<p>SECTION 3 - SCOPE OF SERVICES:</p>
<p>See attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) for details.</p>
<p>SECTION 4 - QUESTIONS:</p>
<p>4.1. The Government is strongly considering a total Small Business Set-Aside for this requirement and is currently exploring five (5) potential scenarios for contract requirements, depending on industry feedback and number of respondents. In the sections below, Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 are primarily designed for Small Business while Scenarios 4 and 5 allow for Large Business participation. Scenarios 4 and 5 will only be considered if two or more capable small business entities are not expected to positively respond. The Air Force is also willing to consider scenarios other than those described herein. The Government is asking industry to provide information regarding any planned teaming arrangements being considered.</p>
<p>Scenario #1 Small Business Prime Contractor - A certified Small Business Entity (registered under NAICS 561210) as Prime Contractor with the technical capability of independently performing 100% of the ARS Requirement under both NAICS, including but not limited to specific experience/capabilities to support the AN/FPS-117 Radar System in accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS). In this scenario, the Small Business Prime Contractor is responsible for 100% of the requirement; however, if a portion of the work is subcontracted, the Small Business Entity must comply with FAR 52.219-14(c) - Limitation on Subcontracting and at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. However, IAW the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a deviation to the subcontracting limit changed the term "personnel cost" to "total contract price".</p>
<p>Scenario #2 Small Business Joint Venture (JV) - A certified Small Business Entity (registered under NAICS 561210) with the technical capability of performing a minimum of 50% of the overall ARS Requirement under Facilities Support Services in accordance with the PWS and entering into a JV partnership arrangement with another business entity (registered under NAICS 517919)&nbsp;possessing the technical capability to operate and maintain all telecommunications systems required in the PWS, including specific experience/capabilities to support the AN/FPS-117 Radar System. In this scenario, the JV is responsible for 100% of the requirement; however, if a portion of the work is subcontracted, the JV must comply with FAR 52.219-14(c) - Limitation on Subcontracting and at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. However, IAW the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a deviation to the subcontracting limit changed the term "personnel cost" to "total contract price".</p>
<p>Scenario #3 Small Business Prime Contractor/Subcontractor Team Arrangement (other than a JV) - A certified Small Business Entity (registered under NAICS 561210) as Prime Contractor with the technical capability of performing a minimum of 50% of the overall ARS Requirement under Facilities Support Services in accordance with the PWS and through a subcontracting arrangement (other than a JV) for up to but not exceeding 50% of the remaining requirement to include NAICS 517919 for the operation and maintenance of all telecommunications systems required in the PWS, including specific experience/capabilities to support the AN/FPS-117 Radar System. The Small Business Entity must comply with FAR 52.219-14(c) - Limitation on Subcontracting. At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. However, IAW the 2013 NDAA, a deviation to the subcontracting limit changed the term "personnel cost" to "total contract price". For this scenario, the phrase "other than a JV" means an arrangement in which a small business and one or more other entities form a business association or other collaboration and consortium agreement.</p>
<p>Scenario #4 Large Business Prime Contractor - A Large Business as Prime Contractor with the technical capability of independently performing 100% of the ARS requirement in accordance with the PWS, including specific experience/capabilities to support the AN/FPS-117 Radar System. IAW FAR 19.702 - Statutory Requirements, submission of an acceptable subcontracting plan will be required.</p>
<p>Scenario # 5 Large and/or Small Business Contractor Teaming Arrangement (other than traditional partnering) - A Teaming Arrangement between two or more businesses of any size to act jointly as a Prime Contractor, with the technical capability of performing 100% of the ARS requirement in accordance with the PWS, including specific experience/capabilities to support the AN/FPS-117 Radar System. IAW FAR 19.702 - Statutory Requirements, submission of an acceptable subcontracting plan will be required. For this scenario, the phrase "Teaming Arrangement" means two or more companies forming a business association of any kind in order to enable the companies involved to complement each other's unique capabilities.</p>
<p>SECTION 5 - RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>5.1. Interested sources are requested to provide a White Paper that identifies one or more of the potential scenarios listed above in which they are technically capable of fulfilling, including answers/information with regards to the following question:</p>
<p>A. For Scenarios 1 through 5, respondents are asked to provide percentage estimates of small business subcontracting possibilities (small business dollar component divided by estimated total contract value). Respondents shall also list the sections and/or subsections of the PWS expected to be subcontracted to small businesses.</p>
<p>B. For Scenarios 4 and 5, respondents are asked to provide your plan for Small Business participation and address what you would consider to be an appropriate incentive should the government impose aggressive Small Business subcontracting goals as part of the evaluation criteria.</p>

<p>L. What is the likelihood of your company proposing on this requirement?</p>
<p>M. The contracting officer invites specific comments from industry as to whether a Period of Performance of either five years; or seven years; or ten years would encourage or discourage firms, especially small businesses, from submitting an offer; and if so, please explain why.</p>
<p>6.2. Responses should focus on your firm's technical and financial capability to provide technical and management services with specialized experience in Facilities Support Services as well as Telecommunications Services for the operation and maintenance of the AN/FPS 117 radars.</p>

If, under this announcement, the contractor will provide systems engineering and technical direction for a system, but does not have overall contractual responsibility for its development, integration, assembly, checkout or production, the contractor shall not be awarded a subsequent contract to supply the system or any of its major components, or to act as consultant to a supplier of any system, subsystem, or major component utilized for or in connection with any item or other matter that is (directly or indirectly) the subject of the systems engineering and technical direction. The term of this prohibition shall endure for the entire period of this contract and for two (2) years thereafter.   <br>   b. If, under this announcement, the contractor will prepare and furnish complete specifications covering non- developmental items, to be used in a competitive acquisition, the contractor shall not be permitted to furnish these items, either as a prime or subcontractor. The term of this prohibition shall endure for the entire period of this contract performance and for either two (2) years thereafter or the duration of the initial production contract whichever is longer. This rule shall not apply to contractors who furnish specifications or data at Government request or to situations in which contractors act as Government representatives to help Government agencies prepare, refine or coordinate specifications, provided this assistance is supervised and controlled by Government representatives.   <br>   c. If, under this announcement, the contractor will prepare or assist in preparing a work statement to be used in competitively acquiring a system or services, the contractor shall not supply the system, its major components, or the service unless the contractor is the sole source, the contractor has participated in the development and design work, or more than one contractor has been involved in preparing the work statement. The term of this prohibition shall endure for two (2) years.   <br>   d. If, under this announcement, the contractor will provide technical evaluation of products or advisory and assistance services, the contractor shall not provide such services if the services relate to the contractor's own or a competitor's products or services unless proper safeguards are established to ensure objectivity.   <br>      <br>

<DESC>The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD (I)) is the principal advisor to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense for all intelligence, counterintelligence and security, and other intelligence-related matters. The DUSD (ISPR) is the principal advisor to the USDI (I) on Department-wide intelligence strategy, intelligence-related acquisition, resource management and technology issues. This includes directing, overseeing and monitoring Service and Combat Support Agency Intelligence Program (MIP) resources supporting the Intelligence Community (IC) Combatant Commands and the Warfighter.
<p>The Director of Intelligence Systems &amp; Architectures (IS&amp;A) reports to the DUSD (ISPR). The IS&amp;A Directorate exercises planning, policy, direction and oversight over the Department of Defense (DoD) intelligence requirements process; analyzes and recommends tradeoffs in defense intelligence acquisition programs to achieve increased defense capability, efficiency and effectiveness. The Directorate is the Defense Intelligence lead for all DoD and IC Chief Information Officer (CIO) activities. Moreover it is with DoD and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) policies through governance, program reviews and assessments against statute and established national and Departmental policies. IS&amp;A is also responsible for providing technical and acquisition expertise leading to recommended USD(I) positions on major acquisition decisions and serves as the lead office to review Services and CSAs for program budget execution and recommend funding alternatives for programs within the Battlespace Awareness Capability Portfolio. In his Chief Information Officer (CIO)-like role, the Director Intelligence Systems &amp; Architectures requests Enterprise Programs/Community Engagement support to the Defense Business Council (DBC), for the purpose of monitoring and contributing to the Strategic Management Plan, Functional Strategy(S); and possibly requesting Out of Cycle Certification of funds for business systems impacting the Intelligence Mission Area, specifically in the area of security.</p>
<p>2.0 Scope/Objective.

The OUSD(I) must have a capability to receive, interpret and understand unique operational intelligence related concerns, as well as an ability to access and advocate those concerns when and where appropriate. This effort will require a team of experts who possess specific and unique space, airborne and intelligence community acquisition, requirement, and programmatic skills and knowledge along with relevant operational expertise and experience. In addition, DUSD (ISPR) requires specialized financial and staff support. The contractor must have capabilities to advise the appropriate DUSD and staff in all matters involving office coordination and management, and associated relations with other departments, agencies, and the Congress.</p>

<DESC>This procurement effort consisting of computer hardware for GCCS-A Deployable Army Joint Composite Server (AJCS) with 3 year support warranty.  Warranty extensions for the current 135 Army Joint Composite Servers (AJCS) that are fielded up to September 2016. AJCS is the common name for the deployable suite of equipment that make up part of the Global Command and Control System - Army (GCCS-A).  It is so named because the system is composed of both Army and Joint applications that provide battlefield Commanders situational awareness through the Common Operational Picture (COP).  It is the primary interface between the collective Joint COP and the Army Mission Command Systems. The first component of this effort includes the procurement of hardware consisting of 26 SUN SPARC T4-1 servers, keyboard/monitors, uninterruptible power supplies, transit cases, computer workstations, and spare hard drives.  The second component of this procurement is the integration of the hardware into the AJCS suite.  The integration effort consists of installing 26 SUN SPARC T4-1 servers, keyboard and  or monitors, and uninterruptible power supplies into transit cases along with all associated cables, slide rails, blank panels, cable management arms, labels and identification plates.  The third component of this procurement is the procurement of services required to support these AJCS systems through September 2016.
