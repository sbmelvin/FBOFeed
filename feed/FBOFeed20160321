<p>This RFI is in support of Market Research being conducted by the Air Force to inquire about one's ability to execute repairs utilizing a Firm-Fix Price. This is not a Request for Proposal (or Solicitation) nor does the Government intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI. This RFI is issued solely for planning purposes. No funds are available to fund the information solicited. The information in this notice is current as of the publication date but is subject to change and is not binding to the Government. Oral submissions of information are not acceptable.</p>
<p>Background of Overall Anticipated N2CS Effort: In order to meet the needs of the Government, the requirements for N2CS will include Field Service Representative (FSR), Program Management, Phase-In, Phase-Out, Engineering Services (both recurring and non-recurring), Software Sustainment, Repair/Sustainment, Modifications, Materials/Spares, Mission Support Facility (MSF) Operation and Maintenance, Travel, and Data.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance: The anticipated period of performance will include a 60 day transition period, 5 one-year options, and two one-year incentive options.<br /><br />Description of RFI: The Government hereby seeks feedback from industry on the contractor's ability to execute repairs utilizing a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) structured as detailed in the Anticipated Period of Performance paragraph, above, and anticipated to be paid out in even monthly increments within each transition/option period. Specifics on potential reparable items along with repair demand for the latest three-year period are attached. <br /><br />Specific Feedback Sought: <br />1. Is FFP repair a feasible approach from the contractor's standpoint?<br />2. What are the potential risks to the contractor utilizing FFP for repair?<br />3. How could the risks provided under #2 be mitigated?<br />4. Provide a rough estimate of the percentage that cost to the Government would increase using FFP for repairs rather than Cost Reimbursable (CR)?<br />5.

These technologies may involve Government, Boeing, or third-party concepts under cognizance of AATD or DoD organization initiatives to improve the survivability of or expand the service life of Boeing technologies and services for the U.S. Army and other supported organizations. The MSDTA program will have a three (3) year ordering period and is based upon estimated to 27,063 man-hours worth of effort. Through issuance of Task Orders, the Contractor shall provide support to effect the necessary material, systems, developments, testing and analysis needed to substantiate the candidate concepts/designs and achieve U.S. Army and DoD technology and mission objectives. Contractor flight testing using Government or contractor-furnished aircraft may be involved.

The maximum value of the contract will be $6 million. The minimum order value will be $25,000 and will be obligated concurrently with award of the IDIQ contract. This acquisition will be procured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

Under each individual task order, ADD-AATD will acquire Boeing's support to effect the Material System Development Test and Analysis required to include various technology integration and test efforts related to the Boeing technologies and services for the U.S. Army and other supported DoD organizations. Through previous investments via Internal Research and Development and Technology Investment Agreements, numerous patents and trade secrets related to material configurations, manufacturing methods, and test protocols related to these systems were developed by The Boeing Company. Additionally, Boeing has in-depth knowledge of the current design and manufacturing methods used in production of its line of rotorcraft for the U.S. Army and of the underlying technologies that enable system performance. Boeing has invested in the manufacturing and testing facilities necessary to enhance or otherwise modify components or systems related to its products.

<SUBJECT>Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships -2 (NextSTEP-2) BAA Synopsis 
<SOLNBR>NNH16ZCQ001K
<CONTACT>Jason Crusan, Phone 202-358-0635, Fax 202-358-2885, Email HQ-NextSTEP-BAA@mail.nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA intends to issue a Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships -2 (NextSTEP-2) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) in the near future. NASA has increasingly embraced public-private partnerships for achieving its strategic goals and objectives for expanding the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunities in space. The next step for human spaceflight is the development of deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human space flight missions in the proving ground around and beyond cislunar space. An important part of NASA's strategy is to stimulate the commercial space industry while leveraging those same commercial capabilities through partnerships and future contracts to deliver mission capabilities.
<p>NASA will be seeking proposals in research areas to include, but not limited to: studies to support mission architecture definition, new approaches to rapidly develop prototype systems, demonstration of key capabilities, validating operational concepts for future human missions beyond low-Earth orbit, and end-to-end design, development, test, and in-space evaluation of future flight systems. This BAA is intended to enable a robust exploration of public-private partnership opportunities with NASA that will complement other NASA activities. The Advanced Exploration Systems Division within the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate has identified key long term potential capability areas that could benefit human space exploration. An omnibus BAA will be released with an Appendix soliciting the first of these key capabilities. Subsequent Appendices will be released soliciting proposals in other key areas as needed.</p>
<p>NASA anticipates initially releasing the omnibus BAA in the April 2016 timeframe with the first Appendix focused on developing deep space habitation concepts, engineering design and development, and risk reduction efforts leading to a habitation capability in cislunar space that can support more extensive human space flight missions in the proving ground around and beyond cislunar space while encouraging application to commercial LEO habitation capabilities. Ultimately this cislunar habitation capability will support development of the human rated deep space habitation and transportation spacecraft by validating the human systems, elements and operations in cislunar space thus enabling human exploration beyond the Earth/Moon system. Under a prior solicitation (NextSTEP BAA NNH15ZCQ001K), NASA is exercising Phase 1 awarded efforts on habitation systems with the plan for continuing some or all of the studies into Phase 2. Appendix A of the omnibus NextSTEP-2 BAA will provide a new opportunity for additional other commercial partners to be added to the Phase 2 efforts.</p>
<p>The duration of contracts will vary depending upon the complexity of the studies or development effort. NASA anticipates phased approaches that may extend up to 5 years. Pending final approval, NASA intends to require minimum cost sharing thresholds and/or matching for the proposed efforts, which may include prior industry investment. <br /><br />Submission information, participant eligibility, additional topic information and specific evaluation criteria for the solicitation will be identified in the BAA and Appendices.</p>

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for the design, analysis, and fabrication of the composite test tanks for the NASA KSC Tank Health Monitoring (THM) Project. These tanks will be test specimens for tests to failure filled with liquid nitrogen with the latest health monitoring instrumentation. Fourteen tanks are needed in total. Twelve cylindrical composite tanks, 6 gallons in volume, 10 inch diameter, overall length 20 inches and two 100 gallon tanks in volume, 24 inch diameter, overall length 56 inches. These tanks will be filled with cryogenic liquid nitrogen and pressurized until tank burst with NASA Health Monitoring Systems active. The tanks are to be fabricated with known flaws (arrived at with consultation with the NASA Principal Investigator (PI) and baseline configurations.)
<p>NASA/KSC intends to purchase the items from Composite Technology Development (CTD). CTD is the only source that has the capability to manufacture composite tanks without liners for use under cryogenic temperatures. These tanks are necessary so that future Spacecraft which use liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen tanks are practical for long term spaceflight. The 100% composite tanks will be a 50% reduction in weight over the current tanks being used, which will aid in reducing the amount of energy required to leave Earth's Orbit. CTD tank technology is required to minimize cracking and voids which develop between metals (or other materials) which have different thermal properties when used for liners vs other composite layers. CTD is the only know source for this based on their patents and propriety processes for the required all composite liner less tanks for cryogenic use.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 4, 2015.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-font-width: 110%">The purpose of this procurement action under other than full and open competition is to execute a one (1) year bridge contract to sustain the DCC services supporting the BPCA pediatric clinical trials. It is critical that the services provided by the DCC not be interrupted as it is an integral part to the success of the BPCA pediatric clinical trials that it supports. A break in the services would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirements. This twelve month contract will allow the incumbent contractor, EMMES, to continue uninterrupted services in support of ongoing BPCA pediatric clinical trials until a new competitive contract can be awarded and the services transitioned to the new contractor. </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-font-width: 110%">As the incumbent contractor, EMMES is currently providing data coordinating services in support of ongoing BPCA Phase 1-3 pediatric clinical trial activities. EMMES has developed and is currently implementing data entry protocols that allow for review of data quality, data analyses, and ultimately study reports that will be submitted to the FDA. Transitioning to a new contractor during such critical junctures as monitoring data, safety monitoring, tracking study progress, and submitting study data to FDA require a high level of coordination, effort and time; therefore, any delays could pose risk to the multiple clinical studies, data and patients. Specifically, interruption in these activities would result in unacceptable delays and unrecoverable losses in vital areas of the studies. In view of that, it is critical that the DCC services not be interrupted, as this operation is essential to the success of the BPCA pediatric clinical trials that its supports.</span></p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) intends to award a five year Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)/Firm Fixed Price (FFP) completion type contract, consisting of one base year and four 1-year options on a full and open competition basis. The contract will provide organizational level maintenance on a variety of aircraft, including both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), in multiple locations in support of the Naval Test Wing Pacific (NTWP). NTWP has two subordinate commands: AIR TEST AND EVALUATION SQUADRON THREE-ZERO (VX-30), located in Point Mugu, CA, and AIR TEST AND EVALUATION SQUADRON THREE-ONE (VX-31) located in China Lake, CA. An overview of each squadron is addressed below:
<p>1.1 VX-30 provides range support for a wide variety of missions conducted both locally at the NAVAIR Sea Test Range off Point Mugu as well as other locations worldwide. The squadron also conducts developmental Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) of aircraft and systems. Support missions comprise range surveillance and clearance (RS&amp;C), optical imaging, and airborne telemetry, and are usually accomplished using P-3 and C-130 aircraft. Squadron aircraft participate routinely as "go/no-go" assets in complex, expensive and high pressure test events with many stakeholders on programs of strategic national significance. Test mission comprise sonobuoy lot testing, manned systems test, and unmanned systems test. VX-30 is the single-site developmental T&amp;E site for the MQ-8B and MQ-8C Firescout Program-of-Record (PoR).</p>
<p>1.2 VX-31's primary mission is to provide test, evaluation, and demonstration of current and/or future aircraft, air weapons, and weapon systems in Developmental and Integrated or Combined Developmental/Operational Test phases of Defense Acquisition. The secondary missions of VX-31 include providing inland search and rescue support for the R-2508 Airspace Complex and operating airborne test bed programs, range support, and test program support. These missions result in a dynamic operational environment highlighted by frequent aircraft configuration changes and schedule flexibility.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the majority of the effort will be performed at the Government facilities in Point Mugu, CA and China Lake, CA. Performance may occur in various other locations, both CONUS and OCONUS, on a temporary basis. Additional information will be included in the Request for Proposal (RFP). Please note that this notice is for the same requirement that was posted under the Request for Information/Sources Sought synopsis number N68936-15-R-0077. The Government anticipates release of a draft RFP in the third quarter of FY 2016 with a final RFP to follow in the fourth quarter of FY 2016. The contract will include six CLINs per year each for non-touch labor with the unit of issue of hours, scheduled/unscheduled maintenance (hours), overtime (hours), travel (lot), M&amp;ODCs (lot), and data (lot).</p>

<DESC>ZEISS OS/CIRRUS HD-OCT 
Model 5000/Version 7.5
Statement of Need


Background:

This is Brand Name Only requirement

The Lebanon VA Medical Center (LVAMC) has a requirement for two (2) ZEISS OS/CIRRUS HD-OCT (Ocular Coherence Tomographer) along with the accompanying external lenses and review software licenses to be purchased for the Lancaster Outpatient Clinic and the Camp Hill Outpatient Clinic.  The providers in these clinics have increased the workload for Optometry for this area and are unable to screen and monitor for Glaucoma in the patient population in these locations.  The OCT scans the layers of the back of the eye, showing normal and abnormal structures at the microscopic level.  It gives baseline information as to effectiveness of treatment on the structural changes in common diseases such as clinically significant macular edema, cystoid macular edema and glaucoma.  In many cases it has replaced the invasive procedure intravenous fluorescein angiograms (IVFAs).  It has become the standard of care for monitoring these conditions and is becoming the standard of care for patients on the medication hydroxychloroquine (plaquenil).  


Solicitation documents will be ready on March 21, 2016.

<p>Contracting Office Address<br />Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness &amp; Response (ASPR)<br />Department of Health and Human Services <br />330 Independence Ave. SW G640<br />Washington, District of Columbia 20201 <br />United States</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>Within the Federal government, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is tasked with protecting the civilian population by providing leadership in research, development, acquisition, deployment, and use of effective medical countermeasures for the adverse health effects resulting from intentional exposure to CBRN threat agents, pandemics and emerging infectious disease threats.</p>
<p>HHS, through the interagency Public Health Emergency and Medical Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE) is responsible for the integration of requirements for the advanced development and procurement of medical countermeasures for CBRN, pandemic influenza and emerging infectious disease threats. The 2014 HHS PHEMCE Strategy and Implementation Plan describes the strategic policy goals and objectives for identifying requirements and establishes the priorities for the development of the medical countermeasures against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats, pandemic influenza and emerging infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Under the Project BioShield (PBS) Act (2004) and the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (2006), BARDA was charged with developing medical countermeasures (MCMs) to address radiological and nuclear threats to the United States as determined by the Department of Homeland Security as Material Threats. In the aftermath of an improvised nuclear device (IND) detonation or a nuclear accident, having rapid and accurate measurements of internal radiation absorption in exposed persons can inform life-saving medical decisions. The high-throughput biodosimetry test is a dose-dependent measurement of the biological changes caused by ionizing radiation that result in internal body damage. The test results will determine the level, duration, and combination of medical care administered to an individual. BARDA anticipates that contracts awarded from this RFP will serve to facilitate the test validation, EUA and FDA diagnostic filings, and the initial stockpiling of biodosimetry tests for use in a nuclear incident.</p>
<p>HHS, through ASPR and BARDA, anticipates 1-2 contract award(s) will be made to radiation biodosimetry test developers. The anticipated period of performance for any resultant contracts may be for a total of up to 120 months which includes the base plus option periods. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Mandatory Criteria for Eligibility <br />Offerors must meet the following mandatory criterion and data must be provided in the proposal to demonstrate eligibility validity for a High-throughput Biodosimetry award:</p>
<p>&bull; Semi-quantitative or quantitative test with an accuracy of &plusmn; 1 Gy (&plusmn; 0.5 Gy preferred) across an absorbed-dose range of 2-6 Gy, measured from 24 hours to at least 7 days post-irradiation<br />&bull; Using an arrangement of no more than 150 instruments, commercially placed in clinical reference, hospital, or public healthcare laboratories, can potentially generate a daily result output capability of more than 60,000 test results over at least 7 days post-incident.<br />&bull; Assay has analytical performance demonstrating the comparability of results between in vivo irradiated human and non-human primate samples, to support entering into design validation per requirements in the U.S. FDA Quality Systems Regulations.</p>
<p>If a Request for Proposal were published, it might include some of the following programmatic objectives:<br />&bull; Advanced development and clinical validation of a high-throughput radiation biodosimetry test candidate <br />&bull; Development of comprehensive milestone-driven test and reagent manufacturing and procurement plans and their execution.<br />&bull; Provision of specialized specimen collection tube capabilities (if required for the test), <br />&bull; Establishment and maintenance of Quality, Risk, Security, and Earned Value Management Systems.<br />&bull; Development of a comprehensive milestone-driven instrument manufacturing or upgrade plan and activities to execute the plan after regulatory action has occurred. <br />&bull; Development of items for Sustainability of Preparedness<br />&bull; Provision of Project Management, Reporting, Meetings/Site Visit Capabilities<br />&bull; Establishment and maintenance of a national stockpile of high-throughput biodosimetry testing reagents<br />&bull; Activities to potentially upgrade the test for greater throughput, higher efficiency, or lower cost without posing new device or assay safety or effectiveness questions<br />&bull; Provision to execute Post-Marketing Commitments and/or Requirements<br />&bull; Establish and maintain inventory procurements</p>
<p><br />Pre-solicitation Notice Objective:</p>
<p>This Pre-solicitation Notice is issued pursuant to FAR Subpart 5.2. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This Pre-solicitation Notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, AMCG is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that an RFP may be available electronically through the FedBizOpps website on or about April 4, 2016, with proposals being due on or about May 31, 2016. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor this internet site (www.fbo.gov) for the release of this solicitation as well as any amendments.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">The Design/Build (DB) Contractor shall provide all equipment, labor, materials, and supervision to accomplish the work stated in this Scope of Work and shown on the Design Intent Drawings furnished by the Government. &nbsp;<br /> <br /> There will be a Pre-Bid Meeting scheduled at the site to discuss the requirements of the project and the bid proposal, to view the project site, and to answer contractor questions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br /><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">The DB Contractor shall investigate the project site and compare the furnished Design Intent Drawings, the Scope of Work, and other related documents with the existing conditions. Using this comparison, Contractors shall include in their cost proposals all work described in the bid documents that is required or reasonably implied to achieve the design intent of the bid documents. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any conflicts between the existing conditions and the renovation work, of any omissions or conflicts in the design intent drawings, or of any clarifications that are necessary.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">This project is the remodeling and expansion of an existing U.S. Magistrate Courtroom into a U.S. District Courtroom.</span>&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">The Design Phase of this project is scheduled to be approximately 75 days in duration. The Contractor&rsquo;s A/E shall make design submissions for review by GSA and the Courts after an initial pre-design meeting at the site. The design shall be based on the Design Intent Drawings, this Scope of Work, the GSA PBS Facilities Standards Handbook, the U.S. Court&rsquo;s Design Guide, and any design clarifications discussed at the pre-design meeting. The A/E may visit the site to do site investigations as often as is needed. Those site visits shall be coordinated through the GSA Project Manager.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">There will be three design submissions at the following points: 65% complete, 95% complete, and 100% complete. Drawing submissions shall include cover sheet, demolition plans, architectural plans, mechanical plans, and electrical plans. All drawings shall be produced on CAD. Specifications may be put on the drawings. There will be on site review of the 65% design submission between the Government and the DB Contractor. Government reviews of design submissions do not relieve the DB Contractor from performing their own quality control, constructability, coordination, and code compliance reviews.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">Drawing levels of detail and quality of representation shall adhere to the AIA guideline &ldquo;Architectural Graphic Standards.&rdquo; All drawings sheets shall show a north arrow and graphic scale. All drawing sheets shall have the standard title block including all pertinent project and drawing information. All abbreviations and line types used shall be defined in on-sheet legends. All notes used shall be keyed to the plan showing where they apply unless they are general notes.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">The 100% design documents, with all corrections and comments addressed, shall be the construction documents used for the project. GSA and the Courts will still review the 100% design documents for completeness and may have additional comments if all previous comments have not been addressed by the A/E. All final 100% construction documents shall be sealed and signed by the responsible A/Es registered in North Carolina in good standing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">The DB Contractor shall also review and approve the final construction drawings and specifications submitted by their A/E, especially to insure that all contract items are included therein. Omissions from the drawings or specifications or any misrepresentations (design omissions and errors) shall not relieve the DB Contractor from performing such intended work. Contract documents, including all amendments, shall rule over any discrepancies with the drawings and specifications.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">The A/E shall provide as-built drawings at the completion of the Construction Phase in CAD, PDF, and paper formats. The construction contractor shall furnish red lined construction documents to the A/E, showing all changes made during construction, for the A/E&rsquo;s use in preparing the as-built documents. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">The DB Contractor should utilize the time during the Design Phase to complete other required tasks such as acquiring security clearances, providing submittals for approval, ordering materials, project planning and scheduling, etc. After the Design Phase is completed, the construction Notice to Proceed will be issued by the Contracting Officer if contractor security clearances have been acquired. The Construction Phase of this project is scheduled to be 150 days duration from Notice to Proceed to Substantial Completion.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">Project time delays caused by the DB Contractor or their subcontractors shall not warrant any extension of project work time. The DB Contractor will be required at their own expense to take actions to get the project back on schedule. If project time delays are caused solely by the Government or beyond the control of the DB Contractor, there will be a fair and reasonable, equitable time extension for performance of the contract. Determinations on delays are only determined by the GSA Contracting Officer. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">Government personnel are scheduled to occupy the building for work during the following hours on weekdays, Monday through Friday, except for established holidays: 7:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. The majority of the construction work can be done during these regular working hours. All work that may disturb the building tenants shall be done after hours (i.e. noisy work or work that causes fumes). The contractor shall figure on 10% of the work being done after hours. The Contractor will be asked to stop work when Court is in session based on the noise level. The Contractor should plan accordingly for these stoppages.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">The Contractor may work after hours for his convenience at no additional cost to the Government. After hours work must be preapproved before work is started. The Contractor will be required to hire security guards for after hours work. Contact information for the security guards will be furnished at the pre-proposal meeting or shortly thereafter. Any necessary power outages required by the work of this project must be preapproved and coordinated with GSA.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">All Contractor personnel that will work on site must have security background clearances. These clearances shall be processed online using a Government provided form. This process will be discussed at the Project Start-up Meeting and forms will be sent to the Contractor. A pictured identification badge (ID) will be issued by GSA to each individual once a clearance has been approved. Any of the DB Contractor&rsquo;s personnel found not wearing their security badge will be asked to leave the premises and not return until the provided security badge is worn visibly on the person. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">The contractor shall protect adjoining areas and finishes from damage during construction. It is in the Contractor&rsquo;s best interest to take thorough pictures of the project site which may show existing damage to items not addressed in the construction documents. This will insure that the Contractor is not held responsible for such pre-existing damage at a later date. Contractor shall transmit one set of pictures to the Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Representative (COR) prior to beginning work.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">A &ldquo;Poly&rdquo; wall to prevent dust and debris from tracking through the building should be used to partition off the Work Area. Walk off mats shall be placed at all entrances to the work area for personnel to wipe their shoes on before exiting the work area. These walk off mats shall be cleaned daily. Contractor shall clean daily the public corridor outside the work area and any public area where the Contractor&rsquo;s workmen have tracked dust or debris. The building cleaning staff is not responsible for cleaning behind the Contractor. Areas shall be as clean as they were before the project began on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">The Contractor shall at all times keep the work area free from accumulations of waste materials. Debris shall be removed on a daily basis. The Contractor shall provide their own dumpster and shall not use any other dumpster already on site. Before completing the work, the contractor shall remove from the work site and premises, all rubbish, tools, scaffolding, equipment and materials that are not the property of the Government. Upon completing the work and before requesting final inspection, the contractor shall leave the work area in a clean, neat and orderly condition satisfactory to the COR.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">The Contractor shall confine their operations to the project site area as indicated on the drawings. There is no parking on site for contractors. The contractor shall keep public areas, such as corridors, stairs, lobbies, and restrooms free from accumulation of construction debris and materials. Existing materials and equipment that are removed as part of the construction operations, and are not to be reused or turned over to the Government, shall become the property of the Contractor and shall be removed from the site.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">The Contractor shall be responsible for repairing or replacing damaged items or areas of the building structure, finishes, equipment, or tenant property resulting from work under this contract.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">The Contractor shall provide samples and submittals of all materials, (i.e. paint, stain, wall covering, carpet, rubber base, ceiling tiles, millwork, doors, frames, hardware, accessories, electrical items, etc.) to the Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Representative (COR) for his written approval before ordering materials. Submittals may be transmitted to the COR by email. Contractor shall create and maintain a Submittal Log showing all submittals, when they were submitted, when they were approved or possibly rejected, and when they were resubmitted and approved if rejected. The Submittal Log shall be shared with the Government.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">The Contractor shall create and maintain an RFI Log including responses with dates of request and response. The RFI Log shall be shared with the Government.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">When the project is substantially complete and after performing their own inspection, the DB Contractor shall request a final inspection by the Government. The Government will provide a punch list to the DB Contractor upon completion of its final inspection. The DB Contractor shall complete the items on the punch list expediently.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">The project can be closed out after verification that all punch list items are complete, after any required O&amp;M manuals have been received, after as-built drawings and specifications have been received, after all required attic stock is received, and after final invoice with release of claims has been submitted, approved, and paid.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 10pt;">The Contractor shall guarantee and warranty all material and workmanship for one year from date of acceptance by the General Services Administration. The Contractor shall provide warranty contact information to the Government for use during the warranty period.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">The estimated price range is between $100,000.00 and $500,000.00.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<a href="mailto:jeanette.mathena@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>Contractor shall completely prepare site and furnish labor and materials and perform work for project: Relocate Nuclear Medicine, project number (589A4-13-124) as required by drawings and specifications at the Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital (HSTMVH), Columbia, MO. Work includes, but is not limited to furnishing of all labor and materials to Relocate Nuclear Medicine.  This project is to relocate the existing Nuclear Medicine department from the basement to two new locations on the first floor of Building 1. Some equipment is to be relocated; some will be replaced during the course of the project. The equipment includes three large CT scanners, one of which is to be relocated. Some existing and new rooms include lead shielding and contain radioactive medical materials. The existing building structure must be reinforced under the new CT unit locations. A new air handling unit that serves the new nuclear medicine department is to be installed on one of the roofs. 
The hospital must maintain kitchen, nuclear medicine, and other services during the project, and close co-ordination with hospital engineering staff is required. Work hours and locations are subject to restrictions as noted in the documents and medical operations requirements. The new work areas are relatively enclosed once construction begins, but work in the basement affects different departments and services which must remain operational. 
Demolition includes removal of walls and ceilings in the basement to allow access to the concrete floor structure above and installation of steel reinforcement and MEP services. Existing ductwork, conduit, piping, and other services must remain in service as they serve areas beyond the scope of this project. These services must be relocated, have temporary connections, or be reconfigured as work proceeds. New work in the basement largely consists of replacing or repairing walls, ceilings, and systems disturbed during the demolition and first floor construction process. 
Demolition on the first floor includes the removal of the existing Cath Lab department walls, ceilings, and services in preparation of the new use. The Cath Lab equipment will be relocated in a previous project (not part of this project). This work includes the removal of existing lead shielding. There is additional demolition in the existing MRI area to convert existing patient dressing and library areas to new administration offices. 
New work on the first floor includes new walls, floor finishes, ceilings, casework, MEP systems, fire protection, and related items in the new Nuclear Medicine areas. Some rooms include new lead shielding within the walls and doors. Where work occurs in main hospital corridors, it must be coordinated with the hospital engineering staff and use temporary walls to secure and separate the work areas from the rest of the hospital. The responsibility of purchasing and installing equipment is noted in the documents, some by the VA, and some by the contractor. The contractor is to coordinate with the VA. 
New MEP services include the installation of a new AHU and a new exhaust fan on the roof. The new AHU is supported by a new elevated steel support structure. The existing roof will require some repair where construction disturbs the roofing, but otherwise it is expected to remain intact. 

 The work will be performed during normal and non-business hours.  The medical centers daily operations cannot be impacted.  The work consists of, but is not limited to, structural steel erection, HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Fire Protection, and Architectural Finishes.  The Estimated range to complete this work is $2 million to $5 million.  
Pursuant to 38 USC 8127(d) and in accordance with Public Law 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Health Care and Information Technology Act of 2006, this construction project will be solicited as a Total set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB). The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this procurement is 236220(General Construction Contractors), with a small business size standard of $36.5 million. The duration of the project will be 240 calendar days from Notice to Proceed. This completion period includes final inspection and cleanup of the premises.  Award will be made utilizing the Best Value Lowest Price Technical Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection Process in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15. Proposal submission instructions will be included in the solicitation package. The government plans to award without discussions. The offeror is responsible to monitor and download any amendments from the Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fedbizopps.gov) website, which may be issued to this solicitation. In accordance with FAR 52.204-7, Required SAM and in accordance with Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 802.101, VetBiz Registration, prospective contractors must be registered in SAM and in the VetBiz databases under the applicable NAICS.  Firms may obtain SAM information at http://www.sam.gov and VetBiz information at http://vetbiz.gov. The solicitation package and drawings should be available for download on or about April 8, 2016 and the proposal due date will be on or about May11, 2016. An organized site visit will be scheduled and the information will be made available at time of solicitation issuance. Only one site visit will be scheduled and interested offerors are highly encouraged to attend. No hard copies of the solicitation or drawings will be provided; and telephone requests or questions will NOT be accepted.

<DESC>Department of the Air Force, 21 CONS/LGCZB Operations and Maintenance Specialized Flight, 135 Dover St, Suite 1055, Peterson AFB, CO, 80914-1117.<br /><br />Description:&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This is not a request for proposal but a survey to locate potential sources for operations, maintenance and support to the Perimeter Acquisition Radar Attack Characterization Systems (PARCS) at Cavalier Air Force Station (AFS), North Dakota.
<p>The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued in the future and will include a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The attached questions and current PWS are provided to help the Government determine the most appropriate avenue for this source selection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A best value source selection is anticipated as the method of contractor selection. The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB) Colorado seeks potential sources to provide 24-hour-a-day, 7 day-a-week operations and maintenance for a geographically separated unit (GSU) meeting mission requirements and other specified lesser requirements in support of the 21st Space Wing and 21st Operations Group.&nbsp;The contractor shall be responsible to provide all labor support required to operate and maintain the PARCS station located at Cavalier AFS, North Dakota.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>PARCS provides 24-hour per-day missile warning and space surveillance coverage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Detects, tracks and reports via data link, real-time earth-impacting objects to the Missile Warning Center or its alternate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Provides, via data link, real-time metric observations and Space Object Identification (SOI) on tasked earth-orbiting objects to the Space Control Center, or its alternate, and the 1st Space Control Squadron (1SPCS). The PARCS has been identified as a critical defense system and therefore, shall be manned on a 24 hour, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year basis. Further, the contractor shall ensure that the contractor's personnel continue to operate and maintain this critical system in the event of a national emergency to include declared or undeclared state-of-war. The subsequent contract will include a projected phase-in period based on market research. The Government anticipates a contract performance period of a basic period with four (4) option periods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contract type has not yet been determined; however, the current contract type is Firm-Fixed Price with cost-reimbursable logistics contract line item numbers<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(CLINs).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<CONTACT>Johnny L. Keith , Mr., Email johnny.l.keith.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The US Army Program Executive Office, Missiles and Space Cruise Missile Defense Systems (CMDS) Project Office is conducting market research to determine if there are potential sources with the capability to provide a high performance modification, designated as the Sentinel A4, for the AN/MPQ-64A3 (Sentinel A3) short range Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) radar.
<p>Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.2, this notice is being issued as a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No contract award is intended as a result of this request. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This Request for Information is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal or a promise to issue a Request for Proposal in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The Government will not pay for the information received. The Government Point of Contact (POC) will be Mr. Johnny L. Keith, US Army Contracting Command-Redstone, Attn: CCAM-SM-T, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898, and can be contacted via e-mail: johnny.l.keith.civ@mail.mil. Mail or Email responses only, no phone calls. The response cut off time is Monday, 2 May 2016 by 1500 CST.</p>
<p>Per FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes:</p>
<p>a.) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, bid and proposal costs, of the FAR.</p>
<p>b.) Although "proposed", "proposal", and "offeror" may be used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>c.) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of acquiring information to modify or replace the Army's AN/MPQ-64A3 Sentinel A3 radar.</p>
<p>SENTINEL RADAR.</p>
<p>The Sentinel Radar is a major component of the Army IAMD System of Systems architecture, providing a surveillance and fire control capability against low altitude air breathing threats, to include Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), fixed wing, rotary-wing, and future capabilities against Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (RAM) threats.</p>
<p>Sentinel, currently deployed in its A3 configuration, provides a critical capability for the acquisition, tracking, classification, discrimination, and identification of aerial threats and cueing and track data to support Beyond Line of Site engagements. It provides air coverage in the forward area (Corps, Division, and Brigade sectors) by providing vital information for timely decision making by the commander, and accurate targeting information to the supported weapon systems. Sentinel also tracks friendly UAS and aircraft, providing support for airspace management de-confliction and fires de-confliction. It provides continuous volume surveillance of friendly and hostile aircraft to enhance protection of friendly aircraft from fratricide.</p>
<p>The Sentinel A3 is an X-band, three dimensional, 360&deg; azimuth coverage, phased array air defense radar with a nominal 75 kilometer instrumented range. The system is equipped with Electronic Counter-Counter-Measure (ECCM) capabilities, a Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) subsystem for positive identification of friendly aircraft, and a suite of Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) capabilities to identify threat aircraft. Sentinel is mounted on a Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) trailer, pulled by a M1082 FMTV truck hosting a 10 kW tactical generator and the command and control interface. Sentinel interfaces with the IAMD Battle Command system, the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) system, and the National Capital Region Integrated Air Defense command and control system.</p>
<p>In order to ensure meeting its mission requirements and to address future Counter-RAM requirements, CMDS plans to modify the Sentinel A3 radar to an A4 configuration that will employ advanced sensor technologies to improve capabilities and performance. The Sentinel A4 will counter the advancing threat evolution in the short range IAMD mission area. These future threats include reduced signature CM targets, smaller and slower UAS targets, and RAM. The RAM threats include both short range (couple/few km) and longer range (low hundreds of km) large caliber rockets (240mm, 300mm), rockets (107mm, 122mm), artillery (122mm, 152mm), and mortars (60mm, 82mm, 120mm).</p>
<p>SENTINEL A4 REQUIREMENTS. <br /><br />Respondents to this Request for Information (RFI) must satisfactorily address the following requirements in their response:</p>
<p>1. The Sentinel A4 must meet or exceed all current Sentinel A3 requirements contained in the Draft Revised Sentinel A3 Requirements Document. The Sentinel Product Office will make this Requirements Document (DRAFT, classified SECRET) available to potential respondents to this RFI.</p>
<p>2. To counter the new threat, the Sentinel A4 must exceed selected A3 threshold performance requirements. The Sentinel A4 requires a greater than 75% increase in range performance, three times the search volume, and twice the track loading capability. A greater than two times increase in track accuracy is required. Performance is required while operating under very stressing radar environments (e.g., electronic attack; anti-radiation weapons; direction finding sensors; mountain, sea, and urban clutter; biological fliers; etc.).</p>
<p>3. Candidate technical solutions to this RFI must currently be at a demonstrated Technology Readiness Level of six or higher (TRL 6).</p>
<p>4. To support a modification of the current Sentinel A3 to a Sentinel A4 capability, the Sentinel Product Office plans to make available a defined interface to the existing Sentinel A3 Signal Data Processor (SDP) and software, to which a new antenna assembly can be added. This antenna assembly would include advanced technologies (e.g., Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology) and interface to the existing SDP. A new antenna assembly will also require new equipment solutions or modifications to the platform, power systems, cooling systems, rotational assembly, and beam steering. The Sentinel Product Office will consider changes to the SDP or a new SDP hardware solution to support a new antenna assembly design. We encourage respondents to suggest alternatives to this approach.</p>
<p>5. Candidate technical solutions must be ready to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD as defined in DoD Instruction 5000.02), without a prior Government funded technology demonstration, in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. Should an award be made, the selected contractor must be ready to hold a Preliminary Design Review in FY 2020 and must have prototype hardware ready for developmental testing, to include qualification and performance testing, in FY 2021 (28 months following EMD contract award).</p>
<p>6. Candidate technical solutions must address the ability and risks to enter Low Rate Initial Production in FY 2023 and Full Rate Production in FY 2025.</p>
<p>7. Candidate technical solutions must be supported by production facilities and proven processes to deliver up to 30 Sentinel A4 antenna assemblies per year. The Government plans to procure 199 antenna assemblies through FY 2032.</p>
<p>8. Candidate technical solutions must include a cost-effective 20-year sustainment plan for the 199 radars that includes Government organic support.</p>
<p>9. The desired Sentinel A4 technology is primarily for United States employment but must have a variant that can be approved for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to existing and new Sentinel FMS customers.</p>
<p>10. Candidate technical solutions must be supported by current demonstrated company experience with advanced X-Band radars.<br />11. Candidate technical solutions must demonstrate that the resulting Sentinel A4 can be produced and sustained in a cost-effective manner.</p>

<p>** ATTENTION** The Sentinel Product Office plans to use non-Government support contractors in assessing industry responses resulting from this RFI. Pursuant to FAR Part 9.505-4, non-Government support contractors must execute an agreement with each RFI industry respondent that states that they will (1) protect the respondent's information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it remains proprietary and (2) refrain from using the information for any purpose other than which it was furnished. Thus, if responses include proprietary information, it must be marked accordingly and each respondent must be willing to sign non-disclosure agreements with the non-Government support contractors listed below so CMDS can properly protect the proprietary information submitted. The following list of non-Government support contractors will be used during this assessment:</p>
<p>1) Canvas, Inc., 4092 Memorial Parkway SW, Suite 100, Huntsville, AL 35802; POC: Jami Peyton, (256) 489-2988, jamipeyton@canvas-inc.com.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and to identify interested sources. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Funding is not available at this time. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the U.S. Army is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential responders to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this subject.</p>
<p>The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. The U. S. Army has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>
<p>Additionally, responses may include data that the offeror does not want disclosed to the public for any purpose or used by the Government except for information purposes. If your company wishes to restrict the data, the title page must be marked with the following legend:</p>

<DESC>Research and Development Sources Sought
<p><br />Topic: Tobacco Plant Production of Stoichiometric Bioscavengers.</p>
<p>Background<br />The Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO) of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is interested in stoichiometric butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) bioscavenger technologies that would eventually become an FDA licensed product designed to protect the Warfighter against multiple organophosphorus nerve agents (OPNAs). To date this is the only protein that demonstrates the desired efficacy against all nerve agent target tested so far by irreversibly binding OPNAs on a one to one molar targets basis. BChE can be isolated and purified from a human source (HuBChE), however, current manufacturing capabilities are limited by high cost as well as limited availability of starting material. Furthermore, the product requires administration of large quantities (hundreds of milligrams) to confer protection against modest levels of OPNAs at prohibitive costs per dose. Manufacturing capabilities to isolate and purify BuChE from non-human matrices are sought to provide a larger availability of starting materials and potentially lower costs per dose. Furthermore, capabilities developed have to be convertible to current good manufacturing practices (cGMP).</p>
<p>Capability Sought<br />The respondent must have demonstrated and shall communicate its experience for the large scale production and delivery of HuBChE from tobacco plant materials in accordance with the following criteria:<br />1.Protein purity of &gt; 99% as measured by SDS PAGE (reduced and non-reduced)<br />2.Specific activity &ge; 653 U/mg measured by the Ellman procedure<br />3.	Tetramer content &ge; 94.5 % determined by size exclusion chromatography<br />4.Glycoslyation of 8-9 sites as determined by mass spectrometry<br />5.Sialic acid terminal occupation ~70% as determined by mass spectrometry</p>
<p>Response Instructions<br />Respondents shall address the information described above (and any additional information the respondent shall deem appropriate) via a Capabilities Statement (five-page limit) in Microsoft Word format. A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for the services outlined above over a three-year period shall be provided. In addition, respondents shall include their name, address, CAGE code, and DUNS, and submit company size standard under the 541711 NAICS code.<br />The information shall be submitted via e-mail to peter.m.falk.civ@mail.mil and devon.r.byrd.civ@mail.mil with a cc: to christina.n.mazzoli.civ@mail.mil. Hard copy submissions will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Submissions shall be submitted no later than 2:00pm local Ft. Belvoir time on 21 April 2016.</p>
<p>Disclaimer<br />This Sources Sought notice is solely for the purpose of gathering information and does not constitute a solicitation or the issuance thereof. Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available.  Requests for same will be disregarded. All information received in response to this notice that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.

<p>6. Analyze and review the Union's Salary Proposal and whether its justification is legitimate.</p>
<p>7. Analyze whether the current DDESS Puerto Rico salary schedule is sufficient to attract, hire and retain quality professional employees.</p>
<p>The contractor must be able to present these reports to DDESS within 15 business days of receipt of award.</p>
<p>The following information is required to be submitted in response to this Sources <br />Sought Notice:</p>
<p>1. Company name and Point of Contact information (address, telephone, email, applicable GSA Contract Number)<br />2. DUNS number and CAGE code<br />3. Business Size<br />4.

<DESC><br />MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) requirement for a Custom-made Experimental Drug Compound 3Fax-Peracetyl Neu5Ac for AD/Tg (Alzheimer Disease/Transgenic) Rats.</p>
<p>The FDA is seeking small business sources to determine the availability and capability of small business manufacturers or small businesses capable of supplying, and subsequently maintaining, a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer for the items described herein. Other than small business concerns are also encouraged to submit capability statements. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort:</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is-446110- Pharmacies and Drug Stores; Small Business Size Standard is $27.5 million.</p>
<p>The NCTR, Division of Neurotoxicology requires an experimental AD drugs to be used for animal (rat) dosing of transgenic (Tg) mice. These drugs are characterized as containing therapeutic and toxicological properties. The purpose is to administer them to an AD/Tg mice population with Alzheimer's disease and the subsequent use of in vitro and in vivo imaging methods to characterize the drug compound's efficacy and toxicity. The drugs will be used in a new type of breeding colony at NCTR, AD/Tg rat strain. This animal is an important model that exhibits all the pathological features commonly seen in humans with AD (Alzheimer's Disease). It is hoped that this model will provide improved understanding of disease development and progression enabling the identification of new biomarkers of the disease and new drug targets.</p>
<p>Transgenic mice have been used to study Alzheimer's disease, but none of them show complete spectrum of AD pathology. The purpose of this protocol is to establish a breeding colony of a genetically engineered rat model of AD to study whether individual components of the metabolic syndrome impact the neurovascular units and associated cerebro-vascular integrity in an animal model of AD. This model has potential to significantly impact FDA science and regulatory policy and will serve to highlight its use as a replacement for currently used models. Options may also be included to purchase additional quantities of this compound. The following custom-made experimental drug compounds required for this study are as follows:</p>
<p>Performance requirements:</p>
<p>3Fax-Peracetyl Neu5Ac (10 grams)</p>
<p>FOB Point Destination. All items shall include shipping, handling and in-side delivery to the destination identified herein. Delivery date is within 6-10 weeks after receipt of order. FOB Point of Delivery for Services and Supplies will be the FDA located at 3900 NCTR Road, Jefferson, AR 72079.</p>
<p>The offeror shall furnish sufficient technical information necessary for the Government to conclusively determine that the offered products/services and components meet the technical requirements identified above. Though the target audience is small business manufacturers or small businesses capable of supplying a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer all interested parties may respond. At a minimum, responses shall include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Business name, DUNS number, business address, business website, business size status (i.e., SB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZone SB, SDB, WOSB, LB), point of contact name, mailing address (if different from business address), phone number and email address (Provide this same information if responding to provide a product manufactured by another firm);<br />&bull; Sufficient descriptive literature that unequivocally demonstrates that offered products and services can meet the above requirements. All descriptive material necessary for the government to determine whether the service/product offered meets the technical requirements including: technical specifications, descriptive material, literature, brochures and other information, which demonstrates the capabilities of the contractor to meet the requirement.<br />&bull; Information on available service/maintenance plans.<br />&bull; Three (3) years of past performance information for the manufacture and/or sale and maintenance support in which the offeror has provided same or substantially similar system solutions and used for same or near-same applications as set forth herein. For each past performance reference include the date of sale, description, dollar value, client name, client address, client point of contact name, client point of contact mailing address (if different from that provided for client), client point of contact phone number, client point of contact email address, and name of the manufacturer (to include DUNS number and size status) if not the respondent.<br />&bull; If applicable, identification of the firm's GSA Schedule contract(s) by Schedule number and SINs that are applicable to this potential requirement.<br />&bull; Provide information if any of these specifications are too restrictive. No response will be considered that the listed specifications are adequate in a competitive environment. <br />&bull; If a large business, identify the subcontracting opportunities that would exist for small business concerns; <br />&bull; Standard commercial warranty and payment terms; and <br />&bull; Though this is not a request for quote, informational pricing is encouraged.</p>
<p>The government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, not identified in the response.</p>
<p>The Government encourages any comments and/or suggestions from any interested party, regarding the specifications. While the Government will not respond directly to your comments and/or suggestions; we will consider them as we finalize the specifications in preparation for the forthcoming solicitation. <br /><br />Interested Parties shall respond with capability statements which are due in person, by postal mail or email to the point of contact listed below on or before March 31, 2016 by 13:00 hours (Central Time in Jefferson, Arkansas) to nick.sartain@fda.hhs.gov, or mail to the Food and Drug Administration, OO/OFBA/OAGS/DAP, Attn: Nick Sartain, 3900 NCTR Road, Building 50, Room 422, Jefferson, AR 72079-9502.

<DESC><p class="FSIPara1">The Foreign Service Institute (FSI) requires the capacity to evaluate the effectiveness of its training programs.&nbsp; FSI seeks to use training evaluation data to understand the extent to which FSI&rsquo;s training meets the learning and development needs of all of its user populations.&nbsp; To this end, training evaluation data need to be stored in a central repository so that FSI system administrators are able to run queries across data from a variety of FSI courses.&nbsp; This requires a Centralized Evaluation System or a series of subsystems that work together to enable FSI to evaluate user feedback from post-training evaluation instruments.</p>
<p class="FSIPara1">The system shall adhere to FSI&rsquo;s Policies and Standards for Curriculum Development and Training Evaluation. &nbsp;The objective is to evaluate comprehensively by assessing the relevance, impact, and value of training to the Department achieved through its training and professional development programs to support curriculum development and instruction. &nbsp;FSI will also evaluate systematically by collecting, analyzing, and reporting evaluation data to support evidence-based decision making.</p>
<p class="FSIPara1">The requirements listed in this document may be supported by one system or by multiple connected sub-systems.&nbsp; The intention is for the overall Centralized Evaluation System/platform/suite to have capabilities to perform (or connect to software which can perform) data storage, data analysis, data visualization, and data management, as well as to create and manage evaluation instruments such as surveys and other instruments for automated and manual forms of evaluation.</p>
<p class="FSIPara1">FSI currently maintains an internal custom-developed computer application that manages FSI student registrations, enrolls students into classes, provides billing services, tracks courses offered, registers students, and produces a variety of training reports.&nbsp; The new system will not replace this student record system, but rather integrate with it.&nbsp; Requirements pertaining to the integration of the Centralized Evaluation System and the student record system are presented beginning on page&nbsp;14. &nbsp;While not the proscribed or preferred solution, one possible structure for the system is presented in the diagram on page&nbsp;15. &nbsp;This diagram is included to provide an initial sense of how this system, or group of systems, may work to meet FSI&rsquo;s needs. &nbsp;Other solutions or refinements are encouraged and requested.</p>

<DESC><p>Sources Sought</p>
<p>This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. The purpose of this notice is to perform market research to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources and (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; woman-owned; small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) as noted. Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) conducts and supports basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases. For more than 60 years, NIAID research has led to new therapies, vaccines, diagnostic tests, and other technologies that have improved the health of millions of people in the United States and around the world. NIAID has a unique mandate, which requires the Institute to respond to emerging public health threats. Toward this end, NIAID manages a complex and diverse research portfolio that aims to expand the breadth and depth of knowledge in all areas of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases; and develop flexible domestic and international research capabilities to appropriately respond to emerging and re- emerging disease threats at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Part I. Background and Objectives</p>
<p>The capacity to evaluate pathophysiologic processes and evaluate innovative therapeutic modalities in an efficient and expeditious manner is an essential element of the efforts of the National institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The Institute has supported efforts to evaluate control measures for infectious diseases during past decades and Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of drugs and immunomodulating agents for the prevention and therapy of infectious diseases.</p>
<p>The NIAID is currently seeking small business sources that can assist its investigations of infectious and inflammatory diseases of importance by facilitating patient recruitment both locally and nationally. Specifically, the Contractor must be capable of providing the following services:</p>
<p>1. Establishing and maintaining relationships with community-based, public health and hospital-based clinics in the Washington-Baltimore metropolitan area within 50 miles of the National institutes of Health, Bethesda campus. The purpose of such relationships is to promote recruitment of eligible patients into various NIAID clinical studies. Immigrant populations served by health facilities within this catchment area represent virtually every area of emerging infectious diseases in the world, especially Africa, Latin America and Asia.</p>
<p>The clinics with which NIAID/ DIR currently has established relationships are:</p>
<p>Upper Cardozo Health Center, Unity Health Care, Inc. (Washington, D.C.) <br />Metro Health (Washington, D.C)<br />La Clinica Del Pueblo (Washington, D. c.)<br />Family and Medical Counseling Services (Washington, D. C)<br />INOVA Juniper Program (Arlington, VA)<br />Unity Health Care, Minnesota Avenue (Washington, DC) <br />Unity Health Care, Brentwood Health Center (Washington, DC) <br />Parkside Health Center, Unity Health Care (Washington, D. C)<br />Unity Health Care, Minnesota Avenue (Washington, DC) <br />MedStar Washington Hospital Center, Infectious Diseases Clinic (Washington, D.C)<br />Casey Health Center (Alexandria, V.A.)<br />Walker-Jones Health Center, Unity Health Care (Washington, D. C)<br />Greater Baden Medical Services (Prince Georges County)<br />Dennis Avenue Health Center (Silver Spring, MD)</p>

<DESC><strong>Title:</strong> Develop a Detailed Project Plan for the Department of Commerce (DOC), Economic &amp; Statistics Administration (ESA) Agency
<p><br />The U.S. Cenus Bureau is issuing this sources sought notice as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement for developing a detailed project plan for the re-organization and merger of the National Technical Information Services (NTIS) agency into the Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) agency. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541990.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; and the government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.</p>
<p><strong>Statement of Work:</strong></p>
<p>1. Introduction</p>
<p>The Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) plays three key roles within the Department of Commerce (DOC). ESA provides timely economic analysis, disseminates national economic indicators, and oversees the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). In this latter role, ESA works closely with the leadership at BEA and Census on high priority management, budget, employment, and risk management issues, integrating the work of these agencies with the priorities and requirements of the Department of Commerce and other government entities.</p>
<p>ESA's expert economists and analysts produce in-depth reports, fact sheets, and briefings on policy issues and current economic events. DOC and White House policymakers rely on these tools, as do American businesses, state and local governments, and news organizations around the world.</p>
<p>2. Objective</p>
<p>A key mission for the organization is the production of in-depth reports, fact sheets and briefings on policy issues and current economic events in support of DOC, White House, American business, state and local governments, news organizations around the world and other decision makers.</p>
<p>To accomplish these tasks, ESA equips its expert staff with the latest technology tools and training.</p>
<p>The objective of this statement of work is to obtain the services of a contractor to develop and submit a detailed project plan as described within this Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
<p>3. Scope</p>
<p>The scope of this effort includes services necessary for a contractor to develop and submit a detailed project plan for the reorganization and merger of the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) into ESA. The plan will incorporate the information, findings and recommendations contained in the financial model report provided by ESA. The ESA/NTIS is preparing to reorganize to comply with legislative direction and better focus on the Department's Strategic Plan, specifically the Data Pillar. The Data pillar of the Strategic Plan calls for transforming the Department's data capacity to enhance the value, accessibility and usability of Commerce data for government, business and the public; improving data-based services, decision-making, and data sharing within the Department and with other parts of the federal government; and collaborating with the business community to provide more timely, accurate, and relevant data products and services for customers.</p>
<p>As part of the Department of Commerce (DOC) strategic plan, ESA will be assuming some of the senior leadership and operational oversight responsibilities, such as financial management, administrative management and programmatic operations. To accomplish this task, a detailed project plan is needed.</p>
<p>4. Requirement and Tasks</p>
<p>The following section of the SOW describes the requirements and tasks that shall be accomplished to meet this requirement.</p>
<p>4.1 Requirements</p>
<p>The contractor must have demonstrated experience and provide support in meeting the following requirements:<br /><br />Must have demonstrated strong computer skills in specialized software, specifically with Microsoft Office Project Planner<br /><br />Must have demonstrated excellent interpersonal skills and excellent interview techniques to be able to conduct interviews; participate in meetings; and serve as Microsoft Office Project Planner subject matter expert</p>
<p>Must have demonstrated experience in Federal Government organization structure, operations and management</p>
<p>4.2 Specific Tasks</p>
<p>4.2.1 Conduct a thorough review of current and proposed ESA and NTIS organizational, financial and operational materials. The review will include the information, findings and recommendations contained in the current oversight board findings. The plan will include Communications, Risk Management, financial systems migration, HR systems migration and Acquisition systems migration amongst other plan components. Additionally, the plan must accommodate scheduling for an anticipated reprogramming that will require Congressional approval. The contractor shall submit the report and work papers to ESA.</p>
<p>Total estimated hours: 300</p>
<p>4.2.2 Conduct a series of meetings with various stakeholders and senior ESA and NTIS leadership to contribute to and review the proposed project plan. These sessions and interviews will include responding to all questions and concerns. The result will be a comprehensive plan outline.</p>
<p>Total estimated hours: 200</p>
<p>4.2.3 Develop and Deliver a Project Plan. The project plan will be in the current version of Microsoft Office Project Plan. It will have a clearly defined "critical path" with milestones and a defined schedule.</p>
<p>Total estimated hours: 125</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Place of Performance</p>
<p>The majority of all work will be performed at the contractor's facility.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Period of Performance</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform these services within 90 days from the date of award.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Statements:</strong></p>
<p>Interested parties responding to this sources sought notice must provide a capability statement demonstrating their capability to fulfill the Government's requirement for developing a project plan. All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business. Brochures alone are not sufficient documentation for demonstration of capabilities. The capability statement shall be in sufficient detail, but not exceed eight pages, so that the Government can determine the experience and capability of your firm to provide the requirement above. Your capability statement should include references. Responses must be received by 4:30 EST on March 25, 2016 via email to Donna Cornish, Contracting Officer, at donna.cornish@census.gov.</p>

The United States Air Force Air Force Material Command (AFMC) has procured the enterprise licensing from Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) for USSOCOM that has allowed the proliferation of the capability throughout the Special Operations community. USSOCOM's current contract supports maintenance, advances the capability of the software, and supports installation, training and upgrades the TRAX software as necessary. As the sole developer of TRAX software, only SNC can provide the appropriate software and level of support. However, USSOCOM is soliciting information to understand current market conditions and to ascertain whether there are any other viable alternatives to TRAX patching, upgrade, integration, training, and exercise support. The necessary objectives include the following five standard support tasks including both software assurance and incidental service support.</p>
<p>1. Software Assurance - track and validate a list of bug fixes, confirm version compatibility, perform configuration management, and ensure revision control.<br />2. Help Desk Support - maintain a full-time help desk technician to answer questions via phone and email. The help desk technician shall provide level-one guidance via phone and email in an effort to resolve user issues as soon as possible during business hours.<br />3. Field Support-Training - maintain a traveling software training team consisting of two personnel experienced with the software and operational usage. Software classes shall consist of a 5-day course of instruction with two instructors per course. Courses shall be tailored to support specific customer usage and reflect most current Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) as well as software revisions.<br />4. Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC/JS J6) collaboration - collaborate with JITC/JS J6 as necessary to achieve requested JITC/JS J6 certifications.<br />5. Field Support-Exercises - provide software program personnel to support exercise and demonstration events. These personnel shall be available to assist in low to mid-level software integration such as Joint Operational Center (JOC) and computer system software setup</p>
<p>Upon the Government's request, the following three additional support tasks are needed:</p>
<p>1. Complex Integration Support - includes any integration that requires a specific platform integration that shall result in a specific plug-in being built into the software.<br />2. Aircraft Demonstrations - support the software and new technology demonstrations during CONUS training events/demonstrations upon request of USSOCOM.<br />3. Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Support - support software OCO locations as requested.</p>
<p>If your organization has the potential capacity to deliver the above noted supplies/services, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>1) Organization name<br />2) Cage Code<br />3) DUNS Number<br />4) Address<br />5) E-mail Address<br />6) Web Site Address<br />7) Telephone number<br />8) Size and type of ownership for the organization<br />9) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION OAK RIDGE OFFICE
ORIGINATING ORGANIZATION:  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, OFFICE OF SCIENCE, OAK RIDGE OFFICE, FACILITIES, INFORMATION, AND RESERVATION MANAGEMENT DIVISION 
PURCHASE REQUEST/SOLICITATION NUMBER:  N/A
I.  IDENTIFICATION OF CONTRACTING ACTIVITY
The Department of Energy, Office of Science, Oak Ridge Office, plans to contract by means other than full and open competition.  This document sets forth the justification and approval for the use of one of the exceptions to full and open competition allowed under the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984.
II. NATURE OF ACQUISITION
The current contract action is to extend the contract that provides roads, grounds, and maintenance services support for the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) in support of the Facilities, Information, and Reservation Management Division under the Office of the Assistant Manager for Administration.  This contract, DE-SC0012828, is cost plus fixed fee, and the contractor is East Tennessee Mechanical Contractors, Inc., 109 Bertrand Street NE, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.  It was awarded following the termination of the previous contract.  This extension is necessary to ensure continuity of services until the competitive follow-on contract can be awarded. 
III. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES
The Oak Ridge Office requires continued services to maintain approximately 100 miles of roads and several hundred acres of grounds that are not directly under the management of the contractors at major ORR sites (East Tennessee Technology Park, Y-12 National Security Complex, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory).  Specifically, these services include: (1) maintaining Levels 1-6 roadways; (2) maintaining utility lines rights-of-way; (3) operating a heavy equipment maintenance shop; (4) maintaining self-service fuel dispensing stations, including operating a fuel dispensing vehicle; (5) maintaining barrier gates, including lock and key control; (6) maintaining historic cemetery fencing, headstones, and gates; (7) maintaining and operating equipment to support wild land firefighting; (8) constructing and maintaining a fire grid; and (9) providing other support activities as needed, such as earthwork construction, construction advice, and outdoor event support.  
A one year extension of the period of performance is anticipated with a start date of June 24, 2016 and an end date of June 23, 2017.  The extension will be structured with a one month base period and eleven option periods of one month each.  The option periods will only be utilized until the competitive contract is awarded and the transition period successfully completed.   
IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
The proposed contract extension is to be made under the statutory authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1), as implemented in FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.    
V.  UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR OR NATURE OF ACTION REQUIRING USE OF THE AUTHORITY
The need for on-going contract support from the current responsible contractor until the competitive follow-on contract is awarded is paramount in fulfilling the Department of Energy (DOE) requirements to ensure that the safety of human life, the protection of property, and national security interests are not compromised.  The services provided under the current contract must be available to respond to events that cannot be predicted, such as fires, inclement weather, emergency responses, and access for national security and law enforcement purposes.  Due to the specificity of DOE security and safety requirements (Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations Part 851), along with the established collective bargaining agreements (CBA) in the Oak Ridge Valley, the current contractor is already performing these services under approved DOE safety and security plans/programs and is signatory to the CBA.  
VI. EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL SOURCES (see DOE Acquisition Guide Chapter 6.1 for specific details)
A small business set aside competitive procurement for the roads, grounds, and maintenance services support is currently in progress.  The posting of this Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition will be released for public viewing at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Questions regarding this posting can be submitted to Jason J. Dozier by email at jason.dozier@science.doe.gov or by phone at 865-576-0562. 
VII. METHOD TO BE USED FOR DETERMINING PRICE/COST REASONABLENESS 
The total estimated value of the base period of performance is $157,500.00, the estimated value of all option periods is $1,732,500.00, and the estimated value of the total action is $1,890,000.00.
The anticipated cost/price of this action will be determined to be fair and reasonable by the Contracting Officer, in conjunction with qualified subject matter experts, based on use of historical data and comparative analysis.  
VIII. MARKET RESEARCH
Results of the sources sought revealed numerous small businesses capable of providing the roads, grounds, and maintenance services support, and as a result, a competitive small business procurement is in process.  
IX. OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (see DOE Acquisition Guide Chapter 6.1 for examples)  
None.
X.  SOURCES THAT EXPRESSED A WRITTEN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION
None.  
XI. STATEMENT OF ACTIONS ORO MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION IF SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS ARE ANTICIPATED
The small business set aside competitive acquisition for the roads, grounds, and maintenance services support is in progress.  It is anticipated that the contract will be awarded the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2016.

<SOLNBR>N62742PLA1307
<ARCHDATE>09302016
<CONTACT>
<DESC>This is a Project Labor Agreement survey only. This is not a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid. There will not be a solicitation, specification, or drawing available at this time. 

NAVFAC Pacific is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for the titled project above. 

Project Description:  Construct a new two story Regimental Consolidated Communications/ Electrical (Comm/Elec) Facility and a six story multi-level parking facility at Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH), Kaneohe Bay. 

The Comm/Elec Facility will consolidate a Marine Regiment and Battalion communications, electrical, and mechanical shops.
 The facility consists of concrete floor and roof structure and single-ply roofing. The facility shall provide for issue of communications gear, support and repair of communications equipment, storage of critical items, maintenance of vehicle communications equipment, and administrative functions. Spaces include, but are not limited to, shops, equipment laydown areas, vehicle maintenance bays, storage, offices, secured room, telecommunications infrastructure including telecommunications maintenance vaults with lockable covers, conference rooms, multi-purpose rooms, locker and shower rooms, break room, restrooms, two two-stop passenger/freight combination elevators, and other supporting spaces.
 

A six story concrete framed paring structure with pile foundations and two six-stop passenger elevators, shall be constructed for approximately 430 POV parking stalls. Parking facility will accommodate spaces that are being displaced by the Comm/Elec Facility.

This is a design/bid/build project.  NAICS Code: 236220 - Construction of Buildings, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The magnitude of construction for this project is anticipated to be between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00. Prime Contractors must self-perform at least 20% of the work. The period of performance is anticipated to be approximately 915 calendar days. 

A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement as described in 29 U.S.C.
 158(f). 

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy states: Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) be consistent with law.
  Reference is made to provision, FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement, and to clause, FAR 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. 

In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs for this project.  Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: 

1. Have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by the public or private sector in Hawaii?  If so, please provide supporting documentation. 

2. Does the local market have sufficient number of available skilled workers for a project of this magnitude?   Are there other projects in the vicinity that will limit the pool of skill labor available for this project?  Please elaborate and provide supporting documentation.
 

3. Are you aware of any past or current labor strikes or disputes that may impact this project?  If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation. 

4. Which Collective Bargaining Agreements will expire during the course of the project that may cause delays?

5. Could a PLA contribute to cost savings in any of the following:
   a. Harmonization of shifts and holidays between the trades to cut labor costs?
   b. Minimizing disruptions that may arise due to expiration of Collective Bargaining Agreements?
   c. Allowing for changes in apprentice-to-journeyman ratio?
   d. Serving as a management tool that ensures highly skilled workers from multiple trades are coordinated in the most efficient way?

6.
 Could a PLA minimize risk and contribute to greater efficiency in any of the following ways:
   a. Mechanisms to avoid delays?
   b. Compliance with Davis-Bacon and other labor standards, safety rules, EEO and OFCCP laws?
   c. Ensuring a steady supply of skilled labor in markets with low supply or high competition for workers?

7. Identify specific reasons why you do NOT believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement. 

8. Could a PLA increase costs on this project?  If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation.

This is not an announcement of the availability of a solicitation nor is it a means of generating a plan holders list.
  After review of the responses to this synopsis, a pre-solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) if the Government intends to proceed with the procurement of this project.  The Government will not contact the responders for clarification of information provided.  This survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for the requested information.  The Government will not provide a debriefing on the results of this survey.  All information will be held in a confidential manner and will only be used for the purposes intended.

The construction community is invited to answer and comment on the use of a PLA for the above titled project.
  Responses shall be submitted via email to Adele Murakami at adele.murakami@navy.mil no later than 10:00 a.m. (HST) on 4 April 2016.

<DESC>Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Atlantic (SSC$B!>(BAtlantic), N. Charleston, SC, intends to increase the ceiling by $1,912,359 and extend the period of performance (POP) for Contract N65236$B!>(B14$B!>(BC$B!>(B2819 with L3 Communications Corporation, from 10 Mar 2017 through 30 Sep 2017 to allow time for completion of this RDT&E contract.
This extension will permit continuity of services in support of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) Communications in Contested Environments (C2E) program.  L3 Communications supports the C2E program through the porting of the Bandwidth Efficient ? Common Data Link (BE-CDL) waveform onto the C2E hardware and the development of advanced anti-jamming (AJ) capabilities within the BE-CDL waveform.  This contract modification includes the introduction of two (2) tasks in the basic contract, tasks 4.0 and 5.0, which include enhancements to the BE-CDL waveform and C2E software development.  In particular, L3 will enhance the BE-CDL waveform to allow for simultaneously operation with Link 16.  This will involve the development of software that adds additional Digital Signal Processor (DSP) techniques such that BE-CDL can operate at the same frequency as other legacy waveforms such as Link 16.  L3 will conduct a performance analysis of the BE-CDL waveform on new C2E hardware to support C2E performance improvements. This will also provide direct support of DSP library and Common Hardware Interface Library (CHIL) development of waveform blocks.  L3 will demonstrate the BE-CDL enhancements showing simultaneous operation with Link 16 plus documentation of applications and limitations.  L3 will enhance the existing C2E software to allow continued waveform and application development with continued common methodology improvements.  This effort will also allow for analysis of system performance and integration of hardware accelerators and include a new deliverable of Asymmetric Multi-Processing Library (AMPLib) software drops every 1.5 months.  Lastly, L3 will integrate formal method tools into the C2E waveform methodology and software framework.  This action is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302$B!>(B1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This ceiling increase and POP extension will provide for the continuation of uninterrupted services to SSC Atlantic.
This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Any responses to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of the work required for this period would be advantageous to the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this contract modification for a ceiling increase and period of performance extension based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be emailed to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Debbie Thomerson, email:  debra.thomerson@gmail.com no later than 05 April 2016.

<DESC>SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT / REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
OPEN MARKET PHARMACEUTICALS
INDUSTRY DAYS

THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), BUT AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN INDUSTRY DAYS EVENT.
The NCO15 CMOP Acquisitions, located in Leavenworth, Kansas, provides contracting support to the Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) program.  The CMOP facilities, located throughout the nation, fill Veteran prescriptions.  The NCO15 CMOP Acquisitions purchases pharmaceutical items that are not available by means of the Pharmacy Prime Vendor Program.  We are interested in gathering feedback on acquisition strategies from small and large businesses related to a possible Open Market Pharmaceuticals contract vehicle(s).  
We plan to conduct a three-day Industry Days event in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e) as part of market research.  The event will be held in Leavenworth, Kansas, and is currently being scheduled for April 26/27/28, 2016.  The objective of the event is to obtain input from pharmaceutical provider industry representatives with expertise in and knowledge of the acquisition of open market pharmaceuticals.  In addition, the event is to provide preliminary information on anticipated requirements, business/contract considerations and possible acquisition strategies.  Further, each interested party will have the opportunity to express their technical, contractual and procedural concerns in regards to this potential acquisition.  The Industry Days will also provide an opportunity for participants to discuss this potential acquisition in terms of industry practices.
There is no commitment by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), SAO Central Region, NCO15 CMOP Acquisitions, to issue a solicitation, make an award, or to be responsible for any monies expended by interested parties in support of this event.  The Department of Veterans Affairs is neither committed nor obligated to pay for information provided, and no basis for claims against the VA shall arise as a result of a response to this Special Announcement/Request for Information.
ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS:
The NCO15 CMOP Acquisitions and CMOP Leadership will conduct individual forty-five minute one-on-one meetings with potential contractors.  Participants are encouraged to bring information relative to the acquisition of open market pharmaceuticals.  The format will permit time for the participant, the CMOP Leadership and the NCO15 CMOP Acquisitions to provide information relevant to an Open Market Pharmaceutical requirement. If the potential contractor is interested in distributing information, they will be responsible for disposition of any items that are not utilized during the event.  
PRESENTATIONS:  We welcome presentations; however, flash drives are not permitted and connection to the VA network is not allowable.  A participant-owned laptop and aircard is acceptable.  If a participant desires to have a presentation uploaded to a VA computer and made available during the face-to-face session, the electronic presentation is to be submitted to VISN15NCOCMOPIndustryDays@va.gov.

<p>11. MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION</p>
<p>This is a contractual arrangement and not a personnel appointment. As specified in FAR 37.101 "Nonpersonal Service Contracts" means a contract under which the personnel rendering the services are not subject, either by the contract's terms or by the manner of its administration, to the supervision and control usually prevailing in relationships between the Government and its employees. All duties outlined in this Statement of Work shall be performed in accordance with standards and methods generally accepted within the contractor's own field of expertise. Payment shall be based on the accomplishment of specific results, and the results to be obtained shall be entirely within the contractor's own unsupervised determination. The COTR will periodically evaluate the contractor's performance of the contract.</p>
<p>12. PAYMENT TERMS</p>
<p><br />Payment will be made electronically to the contractor's bank routing and account number as provided by the contractor by registering in the Central Contractor Registration database at www.ccr.gov. Payment terms as specified in FAR 52.212-4(g) indicate that the due date for making an invoice payment by the designated payment office shall be the 30th day after the designated payment office has received a proper invoice, or the Government accepts the services performed by the contractor. The contractor can however offer discount payment terms for prompt payments as specified in block 12 on the SF-1449 form of this solicitation. Half sessions will not be authorized for payment.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide a monthly billing statement to the Federal Prison Camp, Bryan Accounting Department which accurately reflects days worked, number of sessions and the total amount due for the previous month's services.</p>
<p>If the resulting contract is awarded to an individual(s) or sole proprietorship, the provision of these services has been determined to meet certain criteria of the Internal Revenue Service for creating a common law employee tax liability relationship. In such a situation, the BOP is responsible for the payment of FICA taxes (7.65%) and the withholding of the individual's taxes. These responsibilities apply only when award of the contract is made to an individual or sole proprietorship. It does not apply when the contract is awarded to a company, regardless of the size of the company. For evaluation purposes, an additional 7.65% will be added to the price submitted by individuals or sole proprietorships.</p>
<p>In order to ensure proper preparation of their bi-weekly payment voucher, all hours worked must be documented by the contractor, showing the hours worked during each visit. Documentation will be provided on a "Log of Consultants Visit" form with each entry being signed by the Contractor.</p>

The lowest priced quote will be evaluated for technical acceptability on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. A technically acceptable quote is one that demonstrates that the quoted product meets or exceeds the minimum technical requirements in accordance with the Statement of Work and Appendix A. Award will be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced quote is not technically acceptable, the next lowest priced quote will be evaluated and so on, until a technically acceptable quote from a vendor is identified.</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror<br />within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with The Comfort Group, 659 Thompson Lane, Nashville TN 37204. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p>This notice will be distributed through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 238220; the size standard is $15,000,000.</p>
<p>The FBI has a requirement for the installation of 5 ton PCW (Challenger Replacement) for a server room at the Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center (TEDAC), building 4940 in Huntsville, AL. This requirement is to allow the facility to have a back-up system to what is currently installed in the building.</p>
<p>Market research has determined that there is the potential for other companies to provide the installation of a cooling unit, however the Comfort Group installed the original cooling system; procuring services from this company for a back-up unit will keep all existing warranties associated with the system currently in place.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities to respond to this requirement or submit proposals to this office by 5:00PM EST, on 24 March 2016, by e-mail to the attention of Eliana York, Contracting Officer, at eliana.york@ic.fbi.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE OF FILING REQUIREMENTS FOR AGENCY PROTESTS:</strong><br /><br />A. Preface<br /><br />Prior to submission of an agency protest, all parties must use their best efforts to resolve concerns raised by an interested party. FEMA offers, as an option for dispute resolution, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). ADR in an informal, expeditious and inexpensive way to resolve contract issues and is designed to promote satisfying solutions and fair procedures. For more information on FEMA's ADR services, please contact FEMA's ADR office at the following address:<br /><br />Federal Emergency Management Agency<br />ADR<br />500 C Street SW, Suite 840<br />Washington, DC 20472<br /><br />If concerns cannot be resolved, protesters may use these procedures when a resolution is requested from the agency.<br /><br />These procedures have been designed to create an avenue for resolving third party grievances in connection with the acquisition process outside of formal processes through the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the United States Court of Federal Claims (CFC). Filing an agency protest is not a prerequisite to filing at the GAO or CFC. If the protester files a protest through the GAO or CFC while their protest is pending at the agency level, FEMA may dismiss the agency protest.<br /><br />Pursuing an agency protest does not extend the time for obtaining a stay at GAO.<br /><br />These procedures are in addition to the existing protest procedures contained in FAR Subpart 33.103.<br /><br />B. Definitions.<br /><br />(1) "Agency protest," as used in this SOP, is one that may be filed with either the Contracting Officer or the officer responsible for the resolution of all agency protests filed at the level above the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />(2) "Ombudsman," as used in this SOP, is the agency official above the level of the Contracting Officer designated by the Director of the Acquisition Management Division to handle and issue the formal agency decision resolving the protest. Protesters using these procedures may protest directly to the Ombudsman.<br /><br />(3) "Day," as used in this SOP, is a calendar day. In computing a period of time for the purpose of these procedures, the day from which the period begins to run is not counted. When the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday, the period extends to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday. Similarly, when the Washington, DC offices of FEMA are closed for all or part of the last day, the period extends to the next day on which the Agency is open.<br /><br />C. Submission Guidelines.<br /><br />(1) Agency protests may be filed through the Contracting Officer or, at the level above the Contracting Officer, through the Ombudsman either by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested) as follows:<br /><br />a. Protests filed through the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman must be mailed or faxed to:<br /><br />Gary P. Topper,<br />Department of Homeland Security/FEMA<br />OCPO/Preparedness Section<br />Building D<br />16825 South Seton Avenue<br />Emmitsburg, MD 21727<br />301-447-7280<br />301-447-1092 FAX<br /><br />-OR-<br /><br />David Orris,<br />Ombudsman<br />Department of Homeland Security/FEMA<br />OCPO<br />Building D<br />16825 South Seton Avenue<br />Emmitsburg, MD 21727<br />301-447-1830<br />301-447-1092 FAX<br /><br />b. The outside of the envelope or beginning of the FAX transmission must be marked "Agency Protest".<br /><br />c. If the protester submits the protest directly through the Ombudsman, the protester must also, within one (1) day of submitting the protest to the Ombudsman, submit a copy of the protest to the responsible Contracting Officer either by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested).<br /><br />(2) To be filed on a given day, protests and any subsequent appeals must be received by 4:30 PM, current-local time. Any protests received after that time will be considered to be filed on the next day.<br /><br />(3) Protest submissions will not be considered filed until all of the following information is provided:<br /><br />a. the protester's name, address, telephone number and fax number;<br /><br />b. the solicitation or contract number;<br /><br />c. a detailed statement of all factual and legal grounds for protests, to include an explanation of how the protester was prejudiced;<br /><br />d. copies of relevant documents;<br /><br />e. a request for ruling by the agency;<br /><br />f. a statement detailing the form of relief requested;<br /><br />g. all information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purposes of filing a protest; and<br /><br />h. all information establishing the timeliness of the protest.<br /><br />(4) All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester, and must be addressed to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman.<br /><br />D. Timeliness/Resolution of Protests.<br /><br />(1) Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals. In procurements where proposals are requested, alleged improprieties which do not exist in the initial solicitation but which are subsequently incorporated into the solicitation must be protested not later than the next closing time for receipt of proposals following the incorporation.<br /><br />(2) Protests other than those covered by paragraph (1) of this section shall be filed not later than 10 days after the basis of protest is known or should have been known (whichever is earlier), with the exception of protests challenging a procurement conducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested and, when requested, is required. In such cases, with respect to any protest basis which is known or should have been known either before or as a result of the debriefing, the initial protest shall not be filed before the debriefing date offered to the protester, but shall be filed not later than 10 days after the date on which the debriefing is held.<br /><br />(3) Protests filed through the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />a. Within twenty (20) days after the protest is filed through the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Return Receipt Requested)".<br /><br />b. Appeals<br /><br />i. Protesters who filed protests through the Contracting Officer may, within five (5) days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's written ruling, appeal to the Ombudsman.<br /><br />ii. Requests for Appellate Review must be submitted to the Ombudsman by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested).<br /><br />iii. The Ombudsman will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Mail Receipt Requested)" within ten (10) days of receipt of the request for appellate review of the Contracting Officer's decision.<br /><br />iv. In accordance with FAR 33.103(d)(4) and 4 C.F.R 21.2(a)(3), if there is an agency appellate review of the Contracting Officer's decision on the protest, it will not extend GAO'S timeliness requirements. Therefore, any subsequent protest to the GAO must be filed within ten (10) days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action.<br /><br />(4) Protests filed through the Ombudsman:<br /><br />a. If the protester protests directly through the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Mail Receipt Requested)" within thirty-five (35) days after the protest was filed.<br /><br />b. Protests filed directly through the Ombudsman cannot be appealed within the agency.<br /><br />E. Dismissal of Protests.<br /><br />The agency may dismiss protests when protesters file protests through the GAO or CFC while their protests are pending at the agency level; and for failure to comply with any of the requirements of these agency protest procedures. For example, the agency may dismiss protests that are procedurally or substantively defective (e.g., the protest is untimely or the protest fails to clearly state legally sufficient grounds of protest).</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.<br /><br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-87.<br /><br />The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services. The small business size standard is $15.0M. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small businesses. Simplified acquisition procedures will be utilized.<br /><br /><strong><em>Background Information</em></strong><br /><br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Information Technology Laboratory's (ITL) Information Access Division's Retrieval Group works with industry, academia and other government agencies to promote the use of more effective and efficient techniques for manipulating information not specifically structured for automatic use--especially the browsing, searching, and presentation of that information. Accurate evaluation of the capabilities of current information access systems is a prerequisite to improving the systems' capabilities. Human-created annotations are essential to the evaluation of information systems. Over the years, these evaluations have helped dramatically improve the overall state-of-the-art in information retrieval systems.<br /><br />The work of the Retrieval Group includes the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC).  One of the main goals of TREC is to promote research in information retrieval (IR) by providing appropriate test collections. IR test collections consist of three parts: a set of documents, a set of information needs called "topics" that can be answered by some of the documents in the document set, and a set of relevance assessments that lists for each topic the set of documents that are relevant to that topic.<br /><br />The Clinical Decision Support Track of the TREC was developed to support research on finding clinically relevant information within the medical literature.  Track participants use their retrieval systems to find articles from the biomedical literature that answer one of three clinically-important questions (What is the diagnosis? What test is needed? What treatment should be started?) for each of a set of 30 case studies summarizing a (hypothetical) patient's condition.<br /><br /><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reference attachments for complete combined synopsis/solicitation.&nbsp;</span></em></strong>

<p>I. Description of Requirement</p>
<p>The UOB has a clinical surgery tumor sample bank, tumor cell lines, patient blood and other samples in a branch repository. The Wes<sup>TM</sup> capillary electrophoresis system will allow lab scientists to perform a broad range of assays, such as metabolites assays, necessary to validate the data obtained from the NCI collaborators. Thus, the acquisition of this machine is critical to validating lead therapeutic compounds for pre-clinical trials. This requirement is an innovative bioseparation technology for the cancer metabolism major opportunity research and small molecular targeting at Genitourinary Cancers at the UOB. <br />The Wes<sup>TM</sup> capillary electrophoresis system is a unique, automated size-based separation and nano-immunoassay platform for the detection and characterization of protein molecular weights in denatured protein lysates. It automatically performs all the manual steps typically associated with traditional Western analysis and provides true quantitation of results upon completion of an experiment. The Wes<sup>TM</sup> capillary electrophoresis system can detect proteins at low picogram level and has the unique ability to perform fully automated size-based separation utilizing only nanoliter amounts of test material. Assays can be carried out in three (3) hours and fully analyzed data is available upon completion of the experiment. The system also provides complete training, application support, on-site consulting and service and warranty.

Evaluation Process<br />The Government will perform a technical and price evaluation, based on the Quoter's written submission, to assess the "best value" to the Government, price and other factors considered. Each quoter's written technical submission will be reviewed and evaluated on an adjectival basis, for each of the technical evaluation factors. Simple statements of compliance/reiteration (i.e., "understood"; "will comply"), without a detailed description of how compliance will be met, may not sufficiently demonstrate a quoter's ability to meet the technical requirements and may result in a rating of "fail". Technical evaluations will be conducted using the adjectival ratings and definitions provided below.</p>
<p>(End of Addendum)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The Government will evaluate offers in response to this request in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 procedures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible responder whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Technical Capability:<br />Technical responses shall contain sufficient content for the Government to determine whether quoters understand and have experience with the SOW requirements. Written responses for this section will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria listed below. These factors will be evaluated as pass/fail and past performance and price will not be evaluated if the vendor fails this area.<br /><br /><strong>Factor 1.</strong> Additionally, to demonstrate understanding, the quoter shall propose sound, practical, and feasible methods to accomplish all tasks of the Statement of Work (SOW), within the stated period of performance. For technical approach purposes, quoters shall describe a technical approach in the SOW that supports the requirement. Demonstrated understanding and experience also includes the extent to which the quoter understands the detailed service requirements identified in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p><strong>Factor 2.</strong> Document capabilities and procedures to support product compliance with the NIEHS Standard Specification for Open Formula Rat and Mouse Ration, 18% Crude Protein Autoclaveable (NIH-31) - Attachment II.</p>
<p><strong>Factor 3.</strong> Facilities and Equipment - demonstrate availability of necessary equipment and supply resource to provide the Rodent Feed in accordance with the solicitation requirement (e.g. manufacturing and warehouse facilities, production and warehouse facility grounds, and equipment and machinery as stated in standard specification). A site inspection by the Government may be required as part of the evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Factor 4.</strong> Quality Assurance, Inspection, and Test Procedures - document capabilities to support compliance with quality assurance, inspection, and test procedures.</p>
<p>(ii) Price Evaluation</p>
<p>(b) The Government will evaluate the total proposed price of performing this work (base and all options - for both price quotes), in accordance with the price evaluation section of the RFQ. The Government will evaluate the option under FAR 52.217-8 at award.</p>
<p>Price will not be rated adjectivally, but will be evaluated based on a comprehensive review, in accordance with the pricing content and instructions section above, and as described below.</p>
<p>Price quotes will be evaluated with respect to accuracy and completeness based on information submitted in the written submission. This process will involve verification that figures are correctly calculated, prices are presented in the requested format, and that proposed rates and any applicable discounts are accurate.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Government may utilize one or more of the following methods to evaluate price:</p>
<p>&bull; Review of the proposed level of effort and associated pricing;<br />&bull; Analysis of proposed labor mix;<br />&bull; Comparison to other quotes received;<br />&bull; Comparison and/or analysis based on Independent Government Cost Estimate;<br />&bull; Price Realism; and/or<br />&bull; Comparison/Analysis to historical cost.</p>
<p>As part of the price evaluation, the Government will evaluate the Option to Extend Services (FAR Clause 52.217-8) by dividing the 12-month option period total by two (2), and adding the calculated six-month total to the quoter's total proposed price. Thus, for the purpose of evaluation, the quoter's total price will include the base period, all optional periods and the optional extension of services period. Though, quoters are only required to price the base and option periods and shall not submit a price for the potential six-month extension of services period.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate each quoter's past performance based upon customer satisfaction with the services provided on past or current projects.</p>
<p>(iii) Past Performance.</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp; Quoters shall identify, in detail, three (3) contracts, no more than five (5), which have recently been performed (within the last 3 years), or are currently being performed, which are similar in scope for services of this magnitude and complexity. The quoter shall provide the following information with respect to each of these contracts:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Contract number, Task Order number (if applicable), project title &amp; description of the project</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Total contract value and type of contract<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Date of contract award and period of performance<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Government Agency/Organization Name<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Name, address and telephone number of all applicable contract points of contact<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Brief description of contract work, scope, and responsibilities <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Brief narrative as to how the reference relates to this effort.</p>
<p>As part of past performance evaluation, Past Performance will be evaluated using recent and relevant information obtained from the references provided by the responder as well as past performance information independently obtained by the Government. Past Performance will be evaluated and given of rating of "Acceptable", "Unacceptable", or "Neutral" as defined below. Recent and relevant Past Performance is defined in Addendum to FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, paragraph 2.b. The Government is not required to contact all references provided by the quoter. Also, references other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government to obtain additional information that will be used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance. <br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award proposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br /><br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quotation mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful responder within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quotation (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br /><br />(d) Rating Definitions:<br /><br />Definitions of Ratings for Technical Capability:<br />Pass. Quote meets or exceeds all specified requirements, demonstrates an acceptable understanding of the requirement, and proposes a sound, practical, and feasible approach to accomplish the requirements of the Statement of Work.<br />Fail. Quote does not meet requirements, has not demonstrated an adequate approach, or does not demonstrate an acceptable understanding of the requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions of Ratings for Past Performance:<br /></strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acceptable.</span> Based on the responder's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the responder will successfully perform the required effort, or the responder's performance record is unknown.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unacceptable</span>. Based on the responder's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the responder will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Neutral.</span> No relevant performance record Is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance rating. A search was unable to identify any relevant past performance information for the quoter or key team members/subcontractors or their key personnel. This is neither a negative or positive assessment.</p>
<p>Notes: Quoters are advised that the Government may use past performance information obtained from centralized past performance databases and sources other than those identified by the quoter. The information obtained may be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision.</p>
<p>A quoter who with no relevant past performance record will be rated neither favorably nor unfavorably and will receive a neutral rating. Contracts listed may include those entered into with Government agencies or private sector. For contractors with no relevant past performance, the government may take into account information regarding the past performance of predecessor companies, key personnel with relevant past experience or subcontractors that will perform key aspects of the requirement.</p>

The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449).

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that quotations are due.</p>
<p>(2) Any quotation received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of quotations is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made and the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late quotation would not unduly delay the acquisition.</p>
<p>(3) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that quotations cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of quotations by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of quotations will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(g) Issuance of purchase order. Your quotation should contain your best technical and price terms. The Contracting Officer may reject any or all quotations. The Contracting Officer may issue a purchase order to other than the quoter with the lowest priced quotation. After the evaluation of quotations, the Contracting Officer may negotiate final terms with one or more quoters of the Government's choice before issuing any purchase order. The Contracting Officer will not negotiate with any quoters other than those of the Government's choice and will not use the formal source selection procedures described in FAR Part 15.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may issue a purchase order for any item or group of items of a quotation, unless the quoter qualifies the quotation by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, quotations may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity quoted, at the unit prices quoted, unless the quoter specifies otherwise in the quotation.</p>

The DUNS+4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the quoter to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the quoter does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.

If the quoter does not become registered in the SAM database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered quoter. Quoters may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM database accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p>(l) Requests for information. The contracting officer will not notify unsuccessful quoters that responded to this solicitation. Quoters may request information on award(s) resulting from this solicitation from the contracting officer.<br />The following addenda also apply. Quoters must read and follow these additional instructions to receive consideration:<br />a. System for Award Management (SAM) Registration<br />All Contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management, or SAM prior to award of a Federal Contract. However, due to the need to promptly award a contract after receipt of quotes, registration in SAM, to include completion of the Representations and Certifications, and having a status of "Active" is required BEFORE submitting a quote. For information regarding registration visit www.sam.gov.<br />b. Technical Proposal<br />Quoters should submit a written narrative that thoroughly addresses all non-price evaluation factors listed in section ix below. In addition, the narrative should adequately describe the quoter's plan for executing the work, including resources and personnel available to meet the required timelines. If subcontractors are proposed, the technical proposal should also address qualifications and experience for the proposed subcontractors, including details of past partnerships between the prime and subs, and the prime's experience and plan for managing subcontractors. The narrative should be supported by evidence that gives credibility to the statements made by the quoter and in turn gives the Government enough information to understand and gain confidence in what the quoter is stating. The narrative should be no longer than 5 pages.<br />c. Pricing and Certifications <br />Quoters may utilize Attachment 3 to this solicitation to submit pricing quotations and to complete the applicable representations and certification(s) which include FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items. The quoter must complete the two certifications by reading and checking the appropriate box(es). <br />d. E-mail submissions are acceptable.<br />(viii) FAR provision 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items applies to this solicitation.</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes: <br />(1) Technical capability. Technical capability includes qualifications, relevant experience, and capacity.<br />(2) Price<br />(3) Past performance.<br />Technical capability is more important than past performance; past performance is more important than price. Pricing that is unrealistically low may be considered an indication that the quoter does not possess adequate understanding of the requirement or the requisite technical capability to successfully perform the work.</p>
<p>(ix) Quoters are required to complete the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items. This must be completed at SAM.gov and the registration in an "Active" status. Quoters may use Attachment 3 for this purpose.</p>

<p align="left">original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for these items. As such they are the only source with sufficient knowledge</p>
<p align="left">of the radio design and functionality to perform the requirement. After extensive testing and trade studies, these RSS</p>
<p align="left">radios were integrated into the MVCS Tactical Cabinets which created the baseline system. This system is already</p>
<p align="left">installed onboard LCS sea frames. Replacing these units with another product or manufacturer will not only</p>
<p align="left">duplicate the effort and delay the delivery of the tactical cabinets due to required testing and studies, integrating a</p>
<p align="left">new product could potentially invalidate the testing that MVCS has already completed on the legacy unit. The</p>
<p align="left">replacement may also introduce new problems and interface issues. The Government did not purchase or acquire the</p>
<p align="left">rights in data and design or a technical data package (TDP) for these RSS items because they are commercial items</p>

<p>The Office of Opinion Research will provide a list of approximately 30 questions (26 closed-end questions and 4 open-end questions), plus demographics.  To assist in drafting your proposal, we estimate that the average interview time for this survey will be 22-27 minutes.<br /><br />SUMMARY OF CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>&bull;	Designing an appropriate sample;  <br />&bull;	Translating, back-translating and formatting the questionnaire submitted by the Office of Opinion Research; <br />&bull;	Conducting a pretest;<br />&bull;	Managing fieldwork; <br />&bull;	Coding questionnaires, entering data, checking and cleaning the data; and <br />&bull;	Providing required deliverables: detailed sampling design, translation and back-translation of questionnaire, pretest report, marginal frequencies, data in SPSS and ASCII formats, codebook, methodological report, final version of questionnaire and additional supporting documentation as necessary.</p>
<p>These responsibilities are described in detail below.</p>
<p><br />SAMPLE DESIGN: Design and implement a probability sample design for telephone interviews to achieve a nationally representative sample of at least 1,000 adults age 18 and older. It is anticipated that separate sampling frames may be needed for landline telephones and mobile telephones, leading to a multiple frame survey.</p>
<p><br />QUESTIONNAIRE:  The Office of Opinion Research will provide an English-language questionnaire that will include approximately 30 substantive questions (26 closed-ended, 4 open-ended), focusing on public attitudes toward domestic economic and social issues, as well as international affairs.</p>
<p>One question can contain up to four elements (e.g., "How do you feel about our relations with the following countries: 1) Country A, 2) Country B, 3) Country C, 4) Country D").  If a question contains more than four elements, each additional element will count as 0.5 questions.</p>
<p>In addition, for each respondent the questionnaire and final data set will include:</p>
<p>Demographics: including but not limited to gender, exact age, education, occupation, household income, number of adults in household eligible for the survey, number of working landlines in the household, number of cellular lines used, number of eligible persons sharing the same cellular line, economic class, city, region, urban/rural, political party support, religion and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Interviewing information: <br /><br />&bull;	date of interview (month, day, day of week); <br />&bull;	interview start time, interview end time, duration of interview in minutes;<br />&bull;	variables used to stratify the sample, if any; <br />&bull;	interviewer ID, supervisor ID;<br />&bull;	interviewers' indication of the comprehension and candor of the respondent;<br />&bull;	the number of call-backs necessary to achieve a successful interview, and whether the interview was monitored.</p>
<p><br />TRANSLATION AND BACK-TRANSLATION OF QUESTIONNAIRE:  The Contractor is responsible for translating the questionnaire into colloquial German, and for back-translating the translated questionnaire into English.  The back-translation must be done by someone who has not seen the original English questionnaire.</p>
<p>The Client will review the translation and consult with the Contractor on necessary changes.  The Client must approve the final translation before the pretest, including the CATI sequencing and logic of the questionnaire.</p>
<p><br />PRE-TEST:  After the Client approves the translation, the Contractor will pretest the full questionnaire with at least 25 randomly-selected representative interviews that will not be included in the final sample.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide the Client with a pretest report, including a demographic summary of the participants and a discussion by question of any problems or suggested changes to the questionnaire. The Client must approve any changes to the questionnaire.</p>
<p><br />FIELDWORK: Fieldwork will be done by telephone interview.  All interviews shall be conducted in strict adherence to the sampling plan.  The Contractor is responsible for organizing and overseeing all aspects of fieldwork, including: programming the final questionnaire; selecting and training interviewers; supervising interviewers; enforcing quality controls, monitoring non-response rates; and providing regular feedback to the Client on the status of fieldwork. Nightly field reports are strongly preferred.</p>
<p>Contact with every sampled respondent should be attempted at least 4 times during fieldwork. The contact attempts should be spread over different times of the day and days of the week and weekend.</p>
<p>Note: the minimum achieved sample for the survey is 1,000 fully completed interviews.</p>
<p><br />DATA MANAGEMENT:  The Contractor is responsible for processing, cleaning, and coding the data in English, enforcing quality controls for data entry, and detecting data fabrication, if any.</p>
<p>Closed-end or pre-coded questions:  The Contractor shall use the codes specified on the final questionnaire for all items.</p>
<p>Open-end questions:  The Contractor will develop categories of responses based on 200 randomly selected questionnaires from all regions of the sample, providing at least 5 sample responses for each proposed category.   Categories must be approved by the Client prior to coding responses.</p>
<p>The "Other" category should not include more than 10% of the total responses for any question.  If any single response in the "Other" category amounts to more than 2%, then the Contractor will code this response as a separate response, not as "Other."</p>
<p>Weights: The weight values for each separate case or record should be placed in a designated set of columns and clearly documented in the codebook.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />DELIVERABLES: The Contractor shall deliver the following to the Office of Opinion Research by email:</p>
<p>1)	Detailed sampling design;</p>
<p>2)	Translation and back-translation of the questionnaire;</p>
<p>3)	Pretest report;</p>
<p>4)	Final English and German versions of the questionnaire;</p>
<p>5)	Marginal frequencies (weighted, if appropriate) for all questions, including demographics.</p>
<p>6)	The final, cleaned data files including all survey questions, demographics, interviewing information and (if applicable) weight values.  These files shall be in two formats:</p>
<p>a.	ASCII, with all records having the same length<br />b.	SPSS Windows format (*.sav), with all variables and values labeled in English</p>
<p>7)	A complete codebook for all survey questions, demographics, interviewing information, and (if applicable) weight values, identifying the column positions of all variables in the ASCII file.</p>
<p>8)	A detailed methodological report which contains sufficient details on the sampling design and weighting so that independent researchers would be able to replicate the survey using only information in the report.  In particular, the methodological report shall include the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	A brief report of any unusual problems or significant events which may have influenced the conduct of the survey or the responses given.<br />&bull;	A description of interviewing, including: exact dates of field work; interviewer selection, training and supervision; and enforcement of quality controls.<br />&bull;	A description of the sampling design and procedure, including:</p>
<p><br />o	The universe sampled.<br />o	A detailed description of the sampling frames from which telephone numbers are drawn and a description of the coverage of each frame (percentage of the population reached and any known or potential bias in that frame). <br />o	Identification of any populations excluded from the sample and why these were excluded (for example, by unlisted numbers or by no telephone of any type).<br />o	All forms of stratification used and the basis for stratification.  If you use differential probabilities of selection in sampling (e.g., stratification with different rates by strata), provide the justification for using those rates and describe the expected effects on the variances.<br />o	Selection procedures used at each stage, including use of randomization, and method for selecting the individual respondent in each contacted household. Note: For landline samples, the data collected should include the number of adults in the household who are eligible for the survey and the number of working landlines in the household.  For cell phone samples, the data should include the number of cellular lines used and the number of eligible persons sharing the same cellular line.<br />o	If quotas are used, a detailed description of the quotas and the rationale for using them.<br />o	If multiple frames are used, the procedures for combining samples from the multiple  frames to produce a single weighted data set.<br />o	Description of statistical documentation used to prepare sample (e.g., <br /> census data, official statistics, other research) and date of information. <br />&bull;	If you weight the data, provide a detailed description of weighting procedures.  The Client must be able to recreate weight values based on this documentation, the data sources, and the data file.  Any weights should account for:</p>
<p>o	The probability of selection of the household and the adult (the base weights should be the inverse of the probability of selection);<br />o	Nonresponse and noncoverage; <br />o	Adjustments to match population data (describe sources of population data).</p>
<p>&bull;	Report on sampling performance, including:</p>
<p>o	The number of completed interviews, partial interviews, refusals, failed contacts (e.g. no one at home), cases that are not eligible (e.g. not a residential unit, no adults in the household), and cases of unknown eligibility, and the resulting response rate ("RR1" using the disposition codes and formulas provided by the American Association for Public Opinion Research, AAPOR [www.aapor.org] ).<br />o	The response rate (as defined above) for each frame (if multiple sampling frames are used) and for each city/province/region/interviewer.<br />o	Rate of respondent substitution and procedures for substituting respondents (if <br /> any).<br />o	An estimate of sampling error that takes into account the actual sampling procedures used.  Include a brief explanation of how interviewing and fieldwork procedures affected the theoretical margin of error.</p>
<p>9)	The Client may request additional supporting documentation to fully understand the design and conduct of the survey.</p>
<p>TIME SCHEDULE:  Each stage of the survey project should be conducted according to a schedule agreed to by the Contractor and the Office of Opinion Research, but final deliverabls shall be furnished no later than the end of March 2017.</p>
<p><br />CONFIDENTIALITY: The study is to be conducted in the name of the Contractor, in keeping with standard industry practice. The Client's identity shall not be revealed to field supervisors, interviewers or respondents in order to minimize bias.  Further, the Client's identity, details of the project and the survey results shall not be revealed to outside parties - e.g., media, academic or government -- at any point before, during or after completion of the project without the express written permission of the Client.<br /> <br /><br />ARCHIVING OF STUDY: The Client may store parts of the study (questionnaires, data&nbsp;set, methodological summary) with a non-profit archive (e.g., the Roper Center, the National Archive and Records Administration).  Projects will be embargoed for at least two years, and all identifiable markers of the Contractor will be removed.</p>
<p><br />BILLING AND PAYMENT:  Payment is typically authorized either in a single installment upon receipt and approval of all required deliverables, OR in two installments - the first upon approval of the final questionnaire and sampling plan, and the second upon receipt and approval of all required deliverables.  Please note, payment cannot be authorized upon commissioning the survey.  All payments will be made in U.S. dollars.  The method of payment is typically by electronic funds transfer if the Contractor provides appropriate banking information, but may also be made by U.S. Treasury check.<br /><br /><br />________________________________________________<br />The following solicitation provisions apply to this acquisition:</p>

When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government's historical pricing data. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to the repair of an aircraft component(s). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG38-16-Q-010087 is assigned for tracking purposes only.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. <br />If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>AMC-LEVEL PROTEST (NOV 2008)<br />If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible Contracting Officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.</p>

(k) Taxes. The contract price includes all applicable Federal, State, and local taxes and duties. <BR> <BR>(l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided. <BR> <BR>(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience. <BR> <BR>(n) Title. Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession. (o) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in this contract. (p) Limitation of liability. Except as otherwise provided by an express warranty, the Contractor will not be liable to the Government for consequential damages resulting from any defect or deficiencies in accepted items. (q) Other compliances. The Contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this contract. <BR> <BR>(r) Compliance with laws unique to Government contracts. The Contractor agrees to comply with 31 U.S.C. 1352 relating to limitations on the use of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracts; 18 U.S.C. 431 relating to officials not to benefit; 40 U.S.C. chapter 37, Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards; 41 U.S.C. chapter 87, Kickbacks; 41 U.S.C. 4712 and 10 U.S.C. 2409 relating to whistleblower protections; 49 U.S.C. 40118, Fly American; and 41 U.S.C. chapter 21 relating to procurement integrity. (s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order: (1) The schedule of supplies/services; (2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts, and Unauthorized Obligations paragraphs of this clause; (3) The clause at 52.212-5; (4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software; (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation; (6) Other paragraphs of this clause; (7) The Standard Form 1449; (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments; and (9) The specification. <BR> <BR>(t) System for Award Management (SAM) (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

(b) The Contractor shall comply with the FAR clauses in this paragraph (b) that the Contracting Officer has indicated as being incorporated in this contract by reference to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (Contracting Officer check as appropriate.) <BR> <BR>[] (1) 52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government (SEP 2006), with Alternate I (OCT 1995) (41 U.S.C. 4704 and 10 U.S.C. 2402).

<p>2. Experience:</p>
<p>NIST will evaluate the extent of the offeror's experience providing similar or same equipment and services.</p>
<p>3. Past Performance:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate, as appropriate, successful performance of contract requirements, quality and timeliness of delivery of goods and services, cost management, communications between contracting parties, proactive management and customer satisfaction.. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Between 1929 and 1932, a five-story addition was erected to the south of the original building which was later increased in height to seven stories during the 1940s. The building also features an open air light court at its center that extends down to the roof of the first floor. &nbsp;Both structures have undergone various maintenance and modernization projects over the years, including a major, comprehensive restoration and renovation of both buildings between 1989 and 1996. &nbsp;The building totals 543,510 gross square feet.</span></p>

This occurrence prompted a study which provided an extensive stabilization plan. Structural netting was installed in 2011 as a temporary measure to prevent similar occurrences until the facade is restored.</span></p>

The project also includes correction of failing gutters, tuckpointing, sealant repairs, and the treatment and preservation of: the exterior stone, the brick masonry, and their supporting steel structure.</span></p>

This is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication that a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research. No funds are available to fund the information solicited.

Depot level maintenance is also known as Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO). Additionally, Fleet Maintenance support includes all activities associated with establishing and managing an Inventory Control Point. Procuring/acquiring Line Replaceable Units ( LRU) spares and repairs; researching, analyzing, and resolving items impacted by Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages; developing, updating and distributing Technical and Engineering Data changes and updates; and, performing engineering/sustainment support as necessary.</p>
<p>The contractor will provide support to include, but not limited to: Managing the full cycle of MRO and supply chain management, e.g., planning, scheduling, directing, funding and controlling, to include related support and training equipment; Performance of on-and off-equipment maintenance to include scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, inspections, Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs), Time Change Items (TCIs) and One Time Inspections (OTIs) on the previously listed engines.

<p>Several questions from industry and corresponding Government answers are provided below, to further clarify certain information with regard to sources sought W52P1J16R0107:</p>
<p>QUESTION: Can a party submit multiple responses? For example, submit a response on its own behalf as a sole entity and then separate response(s) as part of a team?</p>
<p>ANSWER: For purposes of the sources sought, involvement of a party in multiple responses is acceptable; each resulting business entity should submit a separate response. Note, however, that for purposes of an eventual solicitation, if multiple offers as joint ventures and various other business entities are pursued, parties must be mindful of practices or events that may evidence violations of&nbsp;the antitrust laws (reference FAR 3.303(c)).</p>

<p>ANSWER: The quantity is 30,000 per year, per round.</p>
<p>QUESTION: For past acquisitions for the 40mm grenade family, the M918 and M385A1 projectile assemblies were provided as Government Furnished Material (GFM). Has this changed?</p>
<p>ANSWER: At this time, a decision on GFM has not been made.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; servicedisabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; womanowned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />Organizations must have in-house capability to perform <em>in vivo</em> rodent and primate pharmacology studies on potential pharmacotherapies for substance use disorders and on new drugs of abuse. This contract will be utilized by the Addiction Treatment Discovery Program (ATDP) within NIDA's Division of Therapeutics and Medical Consequences. Data gathered on potential pharmacotherapies will be used by the ATDP and NIDA's Medications Development Program. The data generated with new drugs of abuse will be provided to the DEA and FDA by NIDA. Testing shall include but shall not be limited to: evaluation of compounds in operant models of behavior, including responding for food reinforcement and intracranial self-stimulation, and evaluation of compounds against withdrawal from abused substances such as nicotine. Testing will also possibly include the evaluation of compounds in other animal models relevant to drug abuse and addiction, the assessment of the <em>in</em> <em>vivo</em> receptor activity of novel compounds, and the evaluation of compounds for their ability to produce, block or prevent physical dependence in rodents and/or primates. Contractors will be blinded to the identity of proprietary test compounds, and all compounds will be evaluated using protocols and experimental parameters as specified by the NIDA Project Officer. Standardized, detailed reports with graphs will be prepared and submitted promptly to the NIDA Project Officer for each compound tested. The number of compound evaluations will vary significantly from year to year. However, it is expected that 10-20 compounds per year will be evaluated in operant behavioral models in rodents and 4-6 per year compounds will be evaluated for their effects on withdrawal in rodents. It is anticipated that 2-3 compounds per year will be evaluated in other relevant animal models (e.g. assessment of <em>in</em> <em>vivo</em> receptor activity and of effects on physical dependence in rodents or primates). The successful offeror must indicate possession of current DEA registration for Schedule II-V substances prior to award and apply for appropriate Schedule I registration.<br /><br />The established NAICS code is 541712. Information sent should be relevant and specific in the technical area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications: 1) Experience: An outline of previous similar projects, specifically the techniques employed in the areas described above; and 2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience in the work requested and knowledge of, and experience in, the field of research.<br /><br />Any other specific and relevant information about this particular area of procurement that would improve our consideration and evaluation of the information presented is desirable. Interested organizations must demonstrate and document, in any capability statements submitted, extensive experience with and the ability to perform the above tasks. Organizations should demonstrate capability to administer and coordinate interrelated tasks in an effective and timely manner. Documentation may include, but not be limited to, contracts both Government and commercial the organization performed, references, i.e., names, titles, telephone numbers and any other information serving to document the organizations capability, e.g., awards, commendations, etc.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement. The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses under this announcement nor otherwise pay for preparing any information sent for the Government's use. Any proprietary information should be so marked. Interested organizations presenting a capability statement must provide the following: 1) company name, address and DUNS number; 2) point of contact, 3) phone/fax/email; 4) NAICS Codes, 5) business size and status; 6) capability information in response to the requirement; and 7) type of small business your organization classifies itself as. Please submit written capability statements by April 5, 2016 to the NIDA Contracting Officer.

However, a determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed action based upon responses to this posting is solely within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp; If no additional Offers are received, the Government will make award to Advanced ElectroMagnetics, Inc. on 07 April 2016, after the closing of this posting. <br /><br />The anticipated award date is 07 April 2016.<br /></p>

The Operating Room uses these devices on a regular basis and due to their delicate nature and history of breakage a full service contract is requested.  For this reason, a purchase order is needed for one (1) year to maintain the endoscope in operable condition to allow uninterrupted critical patient care and diagnosis. Without these devices, various medical procedures have the potential of being cancelled because the necessary equipment would be unavailable.    

Karl Storz Endoscopy America Inc. is the only responsible source per FAR 6.302-1) - capable of providing the repair services for the endoscopes as described in paragraph 3 above without the Veteran's Health Administration experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements.
