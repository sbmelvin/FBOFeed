<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

<DESC>In support of closing the Fernald site by FY2006, Fluor Fernald Inc., the prime contractor at the United States Department of Energy's (DOE) Fernald Environmental Management Project, is seeking to deploy a Vacuum-Assisted Thermal Desorption (VTD) process for the treatment of organically contaminated low-level mixed waste (LLMW) and organically contaminated low-level radioactive soils.  Low-level mixed waste refers to waste that is contaminated with both hazardous and radioactive constituents.  The radioactive components include non-transuranic (TRU) material (i.e., <100 nCi/g TRU isotopes), as well as conventional low-level waste as defined by the United States Nuclear Regulatory commission, and various forms of uranium (depleted, enriched, and special nuclear materials).  Additional information concerning these wastes is posted on the Fernald webpage.  The address is: 

(http://www.fernald.gov/businessopps/acquisitions/vtd.htm).

Fluor Fernald Inc. anticipates that up to 1,400 containers of organically contaminated low-level mixed waste including soils, sludge, and debris will undergo treatment by VTD.  The organic contaminants include used lubricating oils, motor oils, other used petroleum-based products, spent solvents, spent chlorinated solvents, paints, PCBs, and other miscellaneous organics.  The debris could include used absorbent pads, personal protective equipment, plastics, glass, rubber materials, paper, wood, and various metallic objects.  In addition to the 1,400 containers, up to 1,000 cubic yards of organically contaminated soil require treatment prior to disposition.  The soil is primarily contaminated with spent chlorinated solvent compounds, particularly 1,1,1 trichloroethane and tetrachloroethylene.  Thermal desorption must effectively remove contaminant organic compounds so that residual materials are able to pass TCLP, UTS, or LDR standards as applicable.

Fluor Fernald Inc. anticipates awarding a contract for a vendor to mobilize a complete VTD system to an off-site location possessing the appropriate local, state and federal permits.  (Note:  Fluor Fernald Inc. previously solicited expressions of interest for VTD to be deployed at the Fernald site.  This announcement is requesting expression of interest for a VTD deployment at an off-site location.  The responses to this market survey will provide Fluor Fernald with information the will be utilized to evaluate the entire spectrum of deployment alternatives.)  To be considered for this procurement, the prospective Vendor must commit to deploy a vacuum-assisted thermal desorption system if awarded the contract.  The Vendor will be required to process the wastes from start to finish including shipment of waste to treatment site; pre-treatment of the wastes (sizing/sorting/shredding) and properly treating/conditioning the primary and secondary process streams to meet the applicable disposal criteria.  Additionally, the Vendor will be responsible for disposal of the primary and secondary wastes.

The contract will have multiple phases of waste treatment.  The initial phase will consist of first article testing.  Examples of the more challenging waste streams will be processed and the Vendor will provide Fluor Fernald, Inc. with analytical and testing results that indicate the effectiveness of the treatment process.  Additional phases will be task order based and will be dependent on the performance and availability of the Vendor's system.  Both containerized LLMW and organically-contaminated soil could be included in these phases. 

The Vendor will be required to:

1. have the capacity to begin receiving waste within one month of award of contract and to begin treating the waste within six months of award of contract;
2.  have the capacity to receive the entire population of containers within nine months of award of the contract;
3. provide transportation of the wastes from the Fernald site to the treatment system site;
4. and, be responsible
