<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (Department) has a requirement for the support and assistance to the Office of Special Education Programs/Research to Practice Division (OSEP/RTP) in carrying out the development and production of the Annual Reports to Congress (ARCs) required by P.L. 108-446, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA).
<p><br />Since the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (P.L. 94-142) the Secretary has been required to transmit to Congress an annual report that describes the progress being made in implementing the Act to inform Congress and the public of the steady progress made in implementing the Act. The ARCs reflect a history of persistent commitment and effort to expand educational opportunities for children with disabilities.</p>
<p><br />As of the present time, thirty ARCs have been published. These reports describe our nation's progress in providing a free appropriate public education for all children with disabilities, in assuring that the rights of children with disabilities and their parents are protected, in assisting states and localities in providing for the education of all children with disabilities, and in assessing the effectiveness of efforts to educate children with disabilities. Previously published ARCs on the Implementation of IDEA, Part B and C are available at the OSEP website http://www2.ed.gov/about/reports/annual/osep/index.html. To increase the utility of the report, ED redesigned the report, beginning with the 30th ARC. The report was reduced to one volume, grouped into six major sections and three appendices that address the five annual report requirements of Section 664(d) of IDEA set forth below.</p>
<p>(1) analyses and summaries of the data reported by the states and the Secretary of the Interior under section 618;<br />(2) descriptions of the findings and determinations resulting from reviews of state implementation of the IDEA.<br />(3) summaries of the research conducted under Part E of the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002;<br />(4) summaries of the studies and evaluations conducted under section 664 and the timeline for their completion; and<br />(5) descriptions of the extent and progress of the assessment of national activities.</p>
<p><br />This&nbsp;contract action willl support the:<br />&bull; Acquisition and analysis of data and information pertinent to the five annual report requirements contained in section 664(d) of IDEA; and<br />&bull; Planning, development and production of multiple ARCs that address the five annual report requirements contained in section 664(d) of IDEA.</p>
<p><br />This procurement will be set aside for small business as authorized by FAR 6.203. The Department anticipates the release of subject solicitation on or about March 30, 2012. A firm fixed price contract is planned with a 12 month base period and four 12 months option periods. Contract award is planned by June 30, 2012.</p>

The purpose of this conference is to promote weed management throughout North America. Composed of an affiliation of organizations from Canada, Mexico, and the United States this conference is unique in that it connects scientists, practitioners, and policy-makers with their counterparts in Canada, Mexico and the United States. The fact that all three countries are connected by land and roads requires that all three must work together to stop the spread of invasive plants across the continent to mutual benefit. </span></p>

<DESC>NASA/HQ has a requirement to provide high resolution, high power uplink capabilityat Ka-band for the use in characterizing Near Earth Objects (NEOs), orbital debris, andto fill knowledge gaps in space situational awareness.	In fiscal year 2012 NASA willbegin to build on its three element interferometer testbed consisting of 12m dishes todemonstrate: 1) uplink arraying with real time characterization and correction ofatmospheric turbulence, 2) significant power and gain increases enabling high resolutionobject imaging	and 3) real-time continual system phase control  eliminating the need forcostly, highly stable components.   IntelArrays Inc. is  uniquely positioned to provideoverall responsibility for the technical implementation of an X-band and Ka-band uplinkarrays, innovative technology concepts, designs and arraying solutions, as well assystems engineering support and technical assistance for KSC engineering, InterTronicSolutions, Inc. (ISI), and other specialized hardware designers.   NASA is rapidly moving into the Ka-band era, and a Ka-band radar can improve the knowledge of NEOs and other objects of interest by orders of magnitude in preparation forcrewed missions and to satisfy the NEO tracking directive from Congress.  However, forKa-band adaptive optics to work, we must be able to compensate for atmosphericfluctuations in real time.  ISI will reassemble and recommission the 12m antennasnecessary to support this requirement.	 Under contract with  NASA Headquarters, IntelArrays Inc.  will investigate the feasibility and performance of Ka-band adaptivearray combining algorithms with real-time atmospheric fluctuations for use in groundbased distributed phased arrays consisting of widely-spaced small aperture antennas.  The research and development efforts will allow NASA to explore options in architectureand technology to include a high power, high resolution radar system for NEOs, orbitaldebris, and space situational awareness studies. IntelArrays' principals are the originators of and the only team in the world that hasdemonstrated operationally feasible, real-time	radio frequency adaptive opticstechniques.   Their unique qualifications will enable future architecture of the radarsystem and technologies that will enable capability and performance enhancement of ordersof a greater magnitude while at the same time improving the operability and decreasingthe operations and maintenance costs of the current system.NASA/HQ intends to award a sole source contract to IntelArrays, Inc.   The sole sourceauthority used is only one responsible source 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) Only one responsiblesource and no other supplies or series will satisfy agency requirements ( See FAR6.302-1).Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 2:30 p.m. local timeon 03/22/2012.	 Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the Government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<SOLNBR>HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RFP-11-160

<CONTACT>Tawanda Haynes- Brown, Contract Specialist , Phone 301-443-6162, Email haynest@nida.nih.gov - Yvette Brown, Senior Contracting Officer, Phone 301 443-2696, Fax (301) 443-0501, Email Yvette.Brown@nih.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE<br />HHS-NIH-NIDA (AG)-RFP-11-160</strong></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Aging (NIA), intends to negotiate, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, on a noncompetitive, sole source basis, with Johns Hopkins University for the project entitled, "Early Markers of Alzeheimer's Disease in BLSA Participants: Structural and Functional Brain Changes". This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal. All capability statement/proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This effort will be for an eighteen month performance period.</p>
<p>The Early Markers of Alzheimer's Disease in BLSA Participants: Structural and Functional Brain Changes is in accordance with the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii).</p>
<p>Presently, The Johns Hopkins University has provided all the services required to make this contract fully functional. The required contract demands a state-of-the-art volumetric MR and PET-CBF imaging and image processing facilities, including image registration, tissue classification, stereotaxic transformation, regional and voxel-based analysis, as well as network analysis. The Contractor must also have the capability to produce short-lived radiopharmaceuticals, including PET 15O-water and 11C- PiB, which require an on-site cyclotron facility. Lastly, some aspects of the software will remain property of the Contractor and/or subcontractor. For these reasons, all of the existing data cannot be transferred to a new Contractor and this requirement can only be satisfied by one responsible source.</p>
<p>If another contractor were to be awarded this contract, the entire technological infrastructure, including 17 years of Neuroimaging evaluations of BLSA participants, acquired only through this proposed contract, would need to be reproduced from scratch and developed at a cost of approximately $40 million dollars (due to collecting data and designing software). Further, award to another contractor in another geographic location would require a new sample of participants who would have to be followed from the age of 50 to ages from 70-90 years (representing a delay of 20-to 40 years).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND:</span></strong></p>
<p>The BLSA was initiated in 1958 and is a multi-disciplinary study of physiologic and psychologic aspects of normal aging in community-dwelling men and women. Active BLSA participants are volunteers who visit the Clinical Unit of the NIA-IRP in Baltimore, Maryland for testing every 1 to 4 years. Since 1994, we have been conducting a longitudinal brain imaging study of selected older adults in the BLSA to characterize individual differences in longitudinal brain changes, investigate the extent to which these brain changes underlie individual differences in cognitive aging, identify brain changes that may be predictors of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, and assess the impact of potential modulators of brain and cognitive aging. As of August 5, 2011, 1486 neuroimaging evaluations, including 210 PET-PiB scans, have been performed. As part of this research program, it has also been necessary to develop and validate sophisticated tools for analysis of longitudinal neuroimaging data that can be applied in large-scale studies. More than 150 publications have resulted from the work of the initial phases of this project.</p>
<p>Although image acquisition techniques have been refined over the initial contract period, the challenges and expense to conducting and quantifying longitudinal imaging data remain. While recent studies indicate that structural and functional longitudinal changes in specific temporal lobe regions predict cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, data based on the prior contract have shown that using networks of information throughout the brain provide greater sensitivity and specificity to predict who is likely to develop cognitive impairment and dementia and who is likely to remain healthy. BLSA imaging and autopsy studies also show that about 30% of individuals with considerable pathology in their brains remain healthy. Thus, a gap remains in our understanding of the temporal sequence of brain and cognitive changes in healthy aging and disease. The proposed contract will continue to fill this gap in our knowledge about the neuroanatomic and neurophysiologic underpinnings of cognitive and other functional changes and their temporal sequence in aging men and women by maximizing the number of repeated assessments with more recently introduced PET measures of brain amyloid deposition.</p>
<p>In addition to continued analysis of volumetric MRI studies of brain aging, this contract will continue to perform in vivo measurement of vascular changes and amyloid deposition through continued acquisition of PET CBF scans and PET amyloid imaging using 11C PiB. Recent evidence indicates possible synergistic effects of vascular changes and Alzheimer's pathology on the development of dementia. As approximately half of the current sample aged 55 and older is enrolled in the BLSA autopsy program, in vivo imaging changes will continue to be validated against neuropathological findings. The proposed contract will also include analysis of more recently acquired BLSA MR scans, including younger individuals, collected at the NIA 3T facility to provide information on structural brain changes throughout the adult lifespan. Through the use of the existing physical and psychological data for BLSA participants, this project will provide unique insights into our understanding of predictors and the temporal sequence of individual differences in the rate of neuroanatomic, neurophysiologic and cognitive aging.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OBJECTIVE(S):</span></strong> <br /><br />The objectives of this contract are to: 1) continue services currently being performed by the Johns Hopkins University under Contract HHSN263200400012C; 2) Analysis neuroimaging scans of selected participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA); 3) Contacting and scheduling the BLSA neuroimaging study participants; and 4) Administer and monitor procedures during PET imaging and scans.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: <br /><br /></span></strong>The primary tasks for this acquisition include: A) Scheduling and Contacting Subjects; B) Conducting brief Medical Evaluations; C) Image Acquisition and Quantification Procedures; D) Neuropsychological Testing; and E) Collecting Data.<br />REPORTS/DELIVERABLES: <br />The following reports will be required: A) Project Plan; B) Semi-Annual Progress Report; C) Annual Reports; D) Final Report; and E) Electronic transmission of data</p>

<DESC>DESIGN BUILD PROJECT FOR STORAGE BUILDING TO HOUSE EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT AT HOMESTEAD ARB/MIAMI AIR AND MARINE BRANCH, U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION, MIAMI, FL
<p>This procurement is a 100% small business set-aside. Small business size standard of $33.5 million in annual receipts applies. NAICS 236220.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is seeking qualified contractors with Design Build project delivery experience to design and construct a 3,000 s.f. pre-engineered metal storage building to house emergency equipment at the Homestead Air Reserve Base in Miami, FL, for GSA's client, the&nbsp;Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). CBP's Miami Air and Marine Branch, in collaboration with FEMA, currently have no suitable space to properly store emergency supplies. These supplies are being stockpiled for aid response to both man-made and natural catastrophes in the region.<br /><br />The project includes, but is not limited to, the design and construction of a 3,000 s.f. pre-engineered metal building with 16-foot eave height with: wall insulation of 4" Batts with mesh support; roof insulation of 6 Batts with mesh support; continuous ridge mounted gravity ventilation, manually operated; 1,000 s.f. insulated and cooled storage area within the building with double-wide doors for pallet access; an energy efficient cooling and heating unit for the cooled storage area to keep water at room temperature during summer (75 to 80 degrees F.) and above freezing during winter; a cipher lock to the cooled storage area; energy efficient fluorescent warehouse lighting; security lighting for exterior; exterior flood lighting and exit lighting with battery back-up; asphalt paving 12' wide for forklifts to access a roll-up door from main roadway; cipher locks at all exterior doors; one 12' x 12' insulated roll up door with 18 ga. exterior metal and 26 ga. interior metal; two exterior exit doors; two 4' underground conduits and pull boxes with pull strings stubbed up in main building; one 4" empty conduit for emergency power from the storage building to the emergency panel in the main building; and xeriscape landscaping to be compatible with the existing environment.</p>
<p>In addition, alternate pricing will be requested for the following that may be built if funding is available: (1) a 5,000 s.f. pre-engineered metal building with 16-foot eave height; (2) security cameras and a complete Intrusion Detection System (IDS); (3) additional overhead roll-up door; (4) two additional exterior exit doors; and (5) a full-width asphalt access road for commercial vehicles.<br />&emsp;<br />A single Firm-Fixed-Price contract award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal, technical and price, offers the best value to the Government. Evaluation factors will include (1) past performance on projects of similar size, scope, and complexity, (2) experience with design build projects of similar size, scope, and complexity, and (3) qualifications of key personnel. Technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the construction involved in this project is between $250,000 and $500,000. Bonding will be required.</p>
<p>The term of the contract is anticipated to be 150 calendar days from date of award. Construction cannot proceed until Government acceptance of the 100% design documents.</p>
<p>The Request for Proposal is anticipated to be issued on or about March 29, 2012.</p>

After selection of qualified contractors under this planned acquisition, task orders will be issued on an as-needed and as-funded basis for projects at all stations within the VISN19 Rocky Mountain Region. These task orders will be for construction contractor services not to exceed $9,999,999.00 per task order. The total amount of individual task orders which may be placed against each MATOC contract will not exceed $100,000,000.00 beginning with the base year of 2012 and running through the four option years beginning with FY 2013 and ending in 2016.
The solicitation is estimated to be issued in mid-October, 2011 with contract awards estimated to be made at the end of Calendar Year 2011.

 
 Background. 
 The VHA VISN19 Healthcare Network is currently experiencing a lack of quick response capability to execute acquisitions for Medical Facility (MF) infrastructure funding. Executing these MATOCs should result in significantly reduced lead times for acquiring capable contractors to execute these MF projects at competitive pricing.

Required construction services and geographical region to be served
The Contractor shall provide commercial and institutional building construction, electrical and other wiring construction and plumbing, heating, air conditioning construction services.. The task order projects will be performed at the VAMCs located in Denver, CO, Grand Junction, CO, Salt Lake City, UT, Fort Harrison, MT, Sheridan, WY and Cheyenne, WY. Contractors may perform services at any of these locations. Contractors will be provided a fair opportunity to compete for task orders at those locations checked within the dollar range indicated below, if they are awarded a contract. Offerors must state in their offers that they are willing to bid on and complete work for task orders for any of the VAMC locations list below if awarded a MATOC Contract
 
Cost.  The MATOC contract will not be priced other than including a minimum task order amount of $TBD for the Metasys Controls and Energy Upgrade task order and a total not to exceed ceiling amount of $100,000,000 over the five year life (including four one-year options) of the contracts.


Technical requirements and Specifications.  The Contractor will be required to build all task order projects in compliance with the VA Standard Technical Specifications. These specifications and standards are located on the internet website http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/ and shall be used by the contractor.
 Individual task orders will include detailed lists of applicable technical specifications and drawings and the contractor shall build the projects according to these detailed technical specifications and drawings. There will be no performance work statement or performance standard used to define these project requirements.

 Delivery or performance-period requirements. The performance period for this contract is expected to begin upon award and continue for one calendar year thereafter. Four option years will also be included to be exercised as the VA deems necessary.

<DESC>FOR ALL INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT: Susan Tyndall, preferably via email at susan.tyndall@us.army.mil or phone (443) 395-7013.<br><br>This is a Market Survey to identify additional manufacturers/vendors to qualify as Approved Sources of Supply for components used on the High Power Amplifier (HPA) AM-7498/G and some of its subassemblies (except the 2.5kW TWT).  The HPA is used on the military's SATCOM Terminals AN/FSC-78C (Heavy), AN/GSC-39C (Medium) and AN/GSC-52A (SAMT).  Currently the only Approved Source of Supply for the HPA and its subassemblies is MCL, Inc., Bolingbrook, IL (CAGE Code 16469).  The assemblies being considered for procurement are:<br><br>ITEM	 NSN 	   CECOM PART NUMBER	 MCL, INC.      PART NUMBER	     QTY<br>				<br>C/S        CABLE ASSY	5995-01-426-3235	A3187818-104	03C3425-120	1<br><br>IPA ASSY	5998-01-417-8468	A3187818-402	C15417-020	1<br><br>ANODE SWITCH ASSY	5895-01-417-8469	A3187818-403	C15417-055	3<br><br>RF SSA	5996-01-428-9075	A3187818-411	27C3053	23<br><br><br>Interested manufacturers/vendors should understand that any of these items supplied must be form, fit and functional equivalents of and be completely interchangeable with items supplied by MCL, Inc.  Manufacturers/vendors not currently qualified as Approved Sources of Supply will also be required to qualify their product(s) via the First Article Test (FAT) requirements stipulated in CECOM Source Control Drawing A3187818 upon contract award.  The above items are described in Source Control Drawing A3187818, however, detailed functional and interface requirements for the subassemblies are proprietary to MCL, Inc, and are therefore, not available.  We will NOT consider replacing the entire HPA since it will be replaced by the new Modernization of Enterprise Terminals program which will eventually replace all strategic SATCOM terminals.  Suppliers interested in providing any or all of the above items must so indicate by writing to Commander, U.S. Army CECOM LCMC, ATTN: AMSRD-RDER-PRC-ED, Building 6007 3rd floor, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005. <br>The response must include documentation such as test results, copies of purchase orders if the manufacturer/vendor previously produced any of the items for MCL, Inc., or a statement from MCL, Inc., certifying that the manufacturer/vendor can, in fact, produce items which will be physically and functionally interchangeable with items from MCL, Inc.  Prospective manufacturers/vendors may be required to warrant that items they supply will perform satisfactorily when used in the intended application by the military.  This Market Survey does not guarantee a contract by the Government.  For more information, contact Susan Tyndall, preferably via email at susan.tyndall@us.army.mil or phone (443) 395-7013.  Responses must be received no later than March 28, 2012.<br>

Technical Requirements
Response shall include a technical discussion/narrative.  This should be a brief, informal section stating any specific interest, inquiries, basic capabilities, solutions, expertise, and past experiences.

Contractual Descriptions

2.  Are there combinations of best-of-breed products which could provide optimum coverage of the requirements yet not incur a substantial effort in system integration?
3.  Is there such a difference between integrated products and best-of-breed products that the additional cost and time of integration is worthwhile?

BACKGROUND

The COMSUBLANT has been directed to develop and deploy a new automated system that assesses human factors associated with operational stress, proactively evaluating psychological readiness from a risk management perspective in the execution of daily work in underway and in-port environments.
  In support of this, four major objectives have been identified:

(1)  Development of a fully automated anonymous self-assessment of human factors associated with the psychological fitness,  emotional fitness, and operational readiness, as it relates to the performance of duties as members of COMSUBLANT;
(2)  Development of a fully automated reporting process of these aggregated results for Commanding Officers, Squadron Commodore, and Flag Leadership;
(3)  Development of on-line self-help tools that provide tutorial information and will support and facilitate a Sailors ability to improve overall performance with regard to the Human Factors Domains; and 
(4)  Development and execution of town-hall style workshops to provide Sailors with better self-awareness and educational tools for mitigating the untoward psychological effects of the Human Factor Domains.						

The effective management of large, complex organizations such as the Naval Submarine Force depends in large measure on an understanding of the performance of the individual at various levels within that organization.
  In the dynamic, high deployment tempo organizational environment of SUBFOR, it is important from a risk management/risk mitigation standpoint for Commanders to be able to assess the operational stress within their squadron, as well as Commanding Officers within their units a tool that can accurately assess the operational readiness and psychological fitness of a unit can be applied as decision-support information for assisting in the review of existing policies, improving management practices, and facilitating long-range planning associated with automated human performance measurement. 

The contractor shall provide consultation to identify existing Application Programming Interfaces (API) in the immersive training environment.
  The Contractor shall also provide consultative and training services to the Government for the immersive world and utilization of the Power Dreaming software.  The contractor shall be responsible for any cyber space leasing costs charged by the immersive world server.

<DESC><strong>Solicitation Number: <br />AG-3198-S-12-0012 </strong>
<p><strong>Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF<br />THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (ACA)<br />ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (SNAP)<br /></strong><br />This is a Sources Sought Notice for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.</p>
<p>The Government intends to determine through this Sources Sought Notice if there are two (2) or more small businesses that are responsible and capable of carrying out the requisition.</p>
<p>The Office of Research and Analysis (ORA) in the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is seeking a contractor to examine the impact of ACA implementation on SNAP participation. ACA will change how States administer human service programs by expanding Medicaid eligibility and streamlining the enrollment process. Newly eligible people entering the system seeking health insurance may impact the number of SNAP applications, especially in States with joint administration or combined applications for Medicaid and SNAP. FNS seeks a contractor to develop case studies of several states to examine how implementation of ACA affects the coordination of Medicaid and SNAP, describe the process for directing Medicaid applicants to SNAP, and determine how it impacts the number of SNAP applications. The contractor shall assess the effectiveness of different administrative models, report lessons learned, and discuss opportunities for better coordination of the two programs.</p>
<p>The study seeks to determine the impact on SNAP of implementation of ACA. Several key areas are anticipated to impact SNAP. For each of the Objectives, the contractor will collect data at three (3) points - before, concurrent with, and after ACA implementation.<br />OBJECTIVE 1: Describe the coordination of the SNAP and Medicaid enrollment processes in the State.<br />1. Are SNAP and Medicaid co-administered in the same office/department/division in the State?<br />2. Do the same case workers or eligibility workers handle applicants for SNAP and Medicaid?<br />3. Does the State have a combined application for both SNAP and Medicaid?<br />4. Did the State have a combined application before the implementation of ACA?<br />5. Did ACA lead to the development of a combined application?<br />6. If the State does not have a combined application, are there plans to develop a combined application in the future? <br />7. Are programs other than SNAP or Medicaid included on the combined application?<br />8. Is there combined application for each application method (e.g. paper, online, phone)? If not, please describe the differences in the online versus paper versus phone applications?</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE 2: Describe the process for directing Medicaid applicants to SNAP.<br />1. What process, if any, is in place for making Medicaid applicants aware of SNAP?<br />a. Is there a combined application?<br />b. Do case workers or eligibility workers ask about interest in both programs? Does the process vary by eligibility workers?<br />c. If there is not a combined application, do the paper, phone, and online applications direct Medicaid applicants to SNAP?<br />2. Does the process change with the implementation of ACA?<br />3. If applications for SNAP and Medicaid are separate, does the Medicaid application mention other programs for which the individual may be eligible?<br />4. Does the SNAP application direct individuals to Medicaid?<br />5. How are case workers or eligibility workers trained to help individuals apply for both SNAP and Medicaid? Has this changed since the implementation of ACA?</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE 3: Determine the impact of ACA implementation on the number of SNAP applications.<br />1. Relative to States that do not have a joint application, have States with combined applications for SNAP and Medicaid seen higher growth in SNAP since the implementation of ACA?<br />2. Does ACA change the number of SNAP applications that are submitted on paper, online or over the phone?<br />3. For States that have seen growth in SNAP applicants since implementation of ACA, describe the process for directing Medicaid applicants to SNAP.</p>
<p>The study will use case studies and document review of human services offices and health offices in local offices in up to nine states. The anticipated data sources are:<br />&bull; ADMINISTRATIVE DATA. <br />States track enrollments by head-of-household. The case file also includes all members in the SNAP unit, defined as all the people who purchase and prepare meals together. The contractor will be responsible for collecting and preparing the data from the states for analysis, with guidance from ORA. Because collecting data from all 50 states would be cost prohibitive, the contractor and ORA will together determine the appropriate number of states, likely portions of nine states. <br />&bull; CASE STUDIES OF LOCAL OFFICES. <br />Case studies will include interviews with staff and document review to gather information on state and local policies and practices regarding SNAP and ACA/Medicaid. There will be up to three visits to each site so that the contractor can conduct data prior to, concurrent with, and about one year after the January 2014 ACA implementation date.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENT INFORMATION<br />Interested parties are to:<br />&bull; Address their knowledge and experience within the last three (3) years as it relates to the objectives listed above and how they will provide each of the following points (A) through (N). <br />&bull; Reference specific examples of how your firm has addressed the points listed below, and<br />&bull; Demonstrate your ability and experience with:<br />(A) Detailed understanding of SNAP, including regulations, federal policies, and state waivers.<br />(B) Detailed understanding of the ACA and its provisions for Medicaid.<br />(C) Coordinating with states to collect administrative data. <br />(D) Conducting quantitative analysis on administrative-type data, including developing sampling protocols appropriate to meet the government objectives listed above, and using appropriate analysis methods to meet objectives like those listed above.<br />(E) Conducting qualitative interviews in multiple sites with over 50 respondents, including recruiting and training staff to conduct the interviews, using appropriate sampling methodologies, developing interview protocols, recruiting participants, and recording, coding, analyzing, and reporting on qualitative data.<br />(F) Conducting process-evaluation-style site visits, including recruiting sites, obtaining buy-in from affected parties, and using appropriate qualitative data collection techniques.<br />(G) Conducting policy analyses, including locating appropriate policy information.<br />(H) Using multiple sources of data, including administrative data, qualitative data, and policy analysis to address research objectives such as those described above.<br />(I) Ensuring Personally-Identifiable Information is secured and protected.<br />(J) Writing technical reports.<br />(K) Writing reports of technical information put into language appropriate to non-technical audiences.<br />(L) Providing briefings of technical data appropriate for non-technical audiences.<br />(M) Writing policy briefs appropriate for the USDA website and public communication.<br />(N) Managing projects of a similar size and scope, including meeting government objectives, ensuring the quality and timeliness of deliverables, and coordinating with the government funding agency.</p>
<p>&emsp;</p>
<p>Interested parties may submit capability statements that demonstrate their ability to perform all elements of the requirements as described in this notice. In addition, your response must include a description of your past experience on at least three (3) similar projects consistent in scope, size and complexity with this requirement which you performed in the past three years; and description of staff experience and skills.</p>
<p>Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of offeror submission of responses, or the Government's use of such information.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southeast (NAVFAC-SE) intends to award a contract under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2913 which allows the Navy to enter into agreements with gas or electric utilities to design and implement cost effective demand and conservation incentive programs (including energy management services, facility alterations, and the installation and maintenance of energy saving devices and technologies by the utilities) in order to address the requirements and circumstances of the installation. This contract is referred to as a Utility Energy Savings Contract (UESC). For purposes of qualifying under this notice, an entity must meet the definition of a Utility before an agreement can be initiated.
The proposed procurement is for the design and installation of an Energy Management Control System.
  This project provides for HVAC control installation/upgrades in 56 buildings aboard Naval Station Mayport, Jacksonville, FL. The scope of work includes expanding existing Teletrol DDC systems or replacing existing out-dated control systems (pneumatic or electric) with BACNet compatible devices beyond what is included in any ongoing projects.  New DDC points will be identified during design to be provided within existing buildings that already have incorporated DDC controls.  This scope also includes installing new DDC systems in buildings that do not currently have them.  Energy efficient strategies will be incorporated into DDC programming. All buildings will communicate via existing fiber optic network or wireless back to a central work station located at the PWD.
 The central work station will have the ability to monitor, control, and change DDC set points. The Government may elect to proceed with further phases under the UESC which include but are not limited to the engineering and design phase; the implementation phase. This project will be fully funded; therefore, financing provisions under the UESC will not be applicable.
Interested utilities may identify their interest and ability to meet the requirements stated herein and may submit their corporate capabilities for consideration. The submission must include the NAICS code and Cage Code. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.
 Responses to this posting must be submitted to susan.caldwell@navy.mil in PDF format no later than March 28, 2012. Point of Contact: Susan Caldwell, Contracting Officer, Phone (904) 270-3203.

<DESC>Notice Type:		Request For Information<br>Title:			Special Operations Forces Requirements Analysis, Prototyping, Training, Operations and Rehearsal III (SOF RAPTOR III)<br><br>Purpose: The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information and solicit industry comment prior to issuing a competitive solicitation for the SOF RAPTOR III effort.  <br><br>Brief Summary:  The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Product Manager for Special Operations Forces (SOF) Training Systems (PM STS) is looking to get information and feedback from interested sources for a new contract which would replace and expand the existing Special Operations Forces Requirements Analysis, Prototyping, Training, Operations and Rehearsal II (SOF RAPTOR II) contract.  SOF RAPTOR II supports numerous efforts in support of the objectives of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and its component commands:  United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWARCOM), Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC), and Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC).  The new SOF RAPTOR III procurement is intended to support not only the objectives of USSOCOM programs, but to support the objectives of the joint SOF community that USSOCOM interfaces with to conduct operations.  <br><br>Program Description:  PM STS requires a contract vehicle to replace the existing SOF RAPTOR II contract which is close to reaching its ceiling.  The SOF RAPTOR II contract, awarded in April 2009 with a ceiling of $48.9M, is a single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle, which replaced the SOF RAPTOR I contract.   The SOF RAPTOR I contract was comprised of efforts that were 100% Engineering Services, whereas the SOF RAPTOR II contract was a mix of Engineering Services and Program Management efforts.  Both contracts were awarded to small businesses.  <br><br>SOF RAPTOR II provides the means for conducting live, virtual and constructive training, services, training requirements analysis, concept exploration, prototyping, advanced concept exploration, rapid prototype development, and operation and maintenance functions to support USSOCOM and its component command training, simulator and simulation requirements.  <br><br>It is expected that SOF RAPTOR III will continue to evolve in the future and is geared towards overall engineering services management rather than engineering services alone.<br><br>SOF RAPTOR III will provide a vehicle that incorporates the scope of the SOF RAPTOR II contract and will be expanded to include additional scope and tasks that will support all elements of mission preparedness and mission training.  Mission preparedness, rehearsal, and training include primarily SOF tasks and include the joint community that USSOCOM operates and interfaces with such as the NATO Special Forces partners and other Government agencies.  <br><br>Acquisition Strategy:  It is the Government's intent that the SOF RAPTOR III program will be executed as a Small Business Set-Aside competition to result in a single-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity ID/IQ contract. The estimated ceiling of this ID/IQ is $97.8M.<br><br>Request For Information: Interested parties are requested to review the draft Statement of Work and provide your written responses by 12:00 PM EST on March 30, 2012.  The Government is requesting specific responses to the information provided below:<br><br>Administrative:<br>a.	Provide company name, points of contact with phone number, and e-mail.  <br>b.	Every page should have the company name, header, page numbers, date and if applicable the version number.<br>Technical:<br>a.	Program Management:  It is expected that the new SOF RAPTOR III effort will not have funding to cover overarching Program Management functions, outside of individual Task Orders.  <br>i.	Describe your approach to be able to support Task Orders, sometimes with loosely defined requirements, as they arise.  This includes the ability to provide rough order of magnitude (ROM) on cost, schedule, and performance with expedient turnaround times.<br>ii.	Describe your ability to operate in an Integrated Product Team (IPT) environment with the Government and/or its customer, and how your program management is structured to meet very short timelines to make decisions, meet documentation and programmatic suspenses, etc.<br>iii.	Describe your approach to managing the overall contract, subcontracts, and individual task orders.  Differentiate your approach between a Task Order that is complex and program management intensive versus an order that would be a Commercial Off The Shelf procurement. <br>b.	There could be instances where a significant surge of program management efforts (proposal preparation, IPT coordination, etc) is required.  These surges could be random and without notice, yet require a quick turnaround (i.e. 4th quarter of the fiscal year).  Identify your process for staffing and processing multiple proposals, while still managing current efforts.  Describe your ability to surge to meet demands.    <br>c.	A summary of SOF RAPTOR II Delivery Orders is provided only as a reference of the type and variation of orders that were previously executed.  Although potentially representative, there is no guarantee or assurance that these efforts will actually be a part of SOF RAPTOR III.<br><br>Vendors interested in this opportunity are requested to email their response no later than 12:00 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on March 30, 2012 to both the Contract Specialist Mr. Brian Serra (brian.serra@us.army.mil) and the Project Director, Mr. Norbert Granchi (norbert.granchi@us.army.mil).  Contractors are requested to provide a white paper not exceeding ten (10) pages, including the cover sheet.  Font size shall not be smaller than industry standard word processor 12-point Times New Roman in a MS Word document.  <br><br>A previous Sources Sought Notice (SSN), under Solicitation W900KK-12-SR3, was issued to FedBizOpps on November 23, 2011 in conjunction with this effort. This Request for Information (RFI) does not replace, rather coincides with, the previous SSN.  It is requested that all interested parties respond to this RFI even if you previously responded to the November SSN. All responses and feedback will be used to better the upcoming SOF RAPTOR III RFP.<br><br>You can view the previous SSN, here: https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=33c0c1c8fd4a9b9dc093088e1dd67525&tab=core&_cview=0<br><br>Disclaimer:  This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products or services nor will the Government reimburse any parties for costs associated with this request.<br><br>Contracting Office Address:  PEO STRI Acquisition Center 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando FL 32826-3276<br><br>Place of Performance:  PEO STRI Acquisition Center 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826-3276<br><br>Point(s) of Contact:<br>Primary POC - Contract Specialist:  Brian Serra   407-208-3357   brian.serra@us.army.mil<br>Primary POC - PD:  Norbert Granchi   407-384-5387   norbert.granchi@us.army.mil<br>PCO: Lovisa Parks lovisa.parks@us.army.mil <br><br><br>Enclosures:<br>Encl 1 - Draft Statement of Work<br>Encl 2 - Summary of SOF RAPTOR II Delivery Orders  <br>

The stoplogs are to be strengthened by the addition of gusset plates and bracing.  The work will involve welding gussets to structural tee sections, miscellaneous metal work, non-destructive testing (NDT) of welds, installation of structural bracing, possible lead paint abatement, paint preparation and application using US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) formulation vinyl paint V766e, and purchase and installation of replacement seals and bolts.  Gusset plate sizes are typical sizes typically 2.5 feet by 2.5 feet by   inch and welding is in accordance with AWS D1.5 and consists of fillet welds at various application directions and locations.  Approximate size for each stoplog is 4.5 feet tall, 12 feet wide, 91 feet long and weighing up to 65,000 lbs each.<br><br>The stoplogs are stored in the upstream storage pits located on the south side of the navigation lock nearest to the Bascule Bridge.  The upstream stoplogs will be made available as Government Furnished Property.  Method of pickup and delivery will require on-water methods (i.e. barge), due to the stored locations, necessary crane support, logistics and size and weight limitations.  The contract pickup and delivery methods will require coordination with the McNary Dam crane operator and operating project staff.  The stoplogs will need to be removed by barge within the Navigation lock channel.  A specific navigation lock outage schedule, pickup and delivery sequence will be required in order to allow for the most efficient Government support and least impact to the shipping industry.  The stoplogs will need to be removed from the McNary project site by barge in ascending order and will be returned in (reverse) descending order to allow for proper stacking in the storage areas.  All work activities will be required to be completed prior to Fiscal Year 2013 Navigation Lock Outage period.<br><br>

<DESC>International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) Training Services 

I. Introduction: 

This Request for Information (RFI) is for market research and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). VA is currently conducting market research to improve the understanding of the Government's requirements and industry capabilities. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI announcement. 

VA's Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested stakeholders (contractors) for information in regards to a potential procurement for International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition, (ICD-10) Procedure Coding System/Clinical Modification (PCS/CM) training services.  At this time, no formal requirement or solicitation exists; therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF A SOLICITATION.  This nationwide effort includes the development of ICD-10 training courses and training for approximately 175,000 VHA personnel who will support all VA Medical Centers, seven (7) Consolidated Patient Account Center CPACs, and other offices providing centralized services.  

II. Background: 

The compliance date for implementation of ICD-10 is October 1, 2013.  ICD-10 will replace the ICD-9-CM code set in all health care settings for diagnosis reporting with dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or after October 1, 2013.  VHA will utilize ICD-10 codes for a variety of purposes, such as: clinical studies, performance measurement, workload capture, cost determination, resource allocation, classifying morbidity and mortality, indexing of hospital records by disease and operations, data storage and retrieval, and reimbursement activities.

As a result, VA seeks training services in preparation for implementation of ICD-10 for all modes of operations, including but not limited to, recording clinical diagnosis and procedures, reporting, reimbursement, and statistical analysis.  Depending on the results of market research, there may be different contracting alternatives to meet the objectives identified in this request.  

 III. Requirements: 

VA has developed a training plan; therefore, this is not an anticipated requirement.  Anticipated requirements from contractor(s) include the following:
"	the development of course content with any support tools that would be utilized
"	to provide instructor-led training in preparation for the implementation of ICD-10
"	administration and management of instructor-led training
"	to provide various instructor-led training delivery modalities (i.e. web-based, face to face, etc.)
"	to provide defined training location(s) for any face to face training.
"	to identify/provide specific trainer credentials representing expertise in ICD-10 for each separate audience group impacted by the implementation of ICD-10.  Anticipated audience groups include:
o	Health Information Management (HIM) Coders and Coding Compliance Professionals
"	Individuals who analyze, abstract, audit health record data, and assign codes used in clinical classification systems based on health record documentation and official guidelines
o	Providers
"	Individuals associated with business entities who furnish healthcare to a consumer, including a licensed or non-licensed practitioner who is authorized to operate within the VA healthcare system
o	General
"	Individuals with a responsibility for using or interpreting ICD coded data in day-to-day activities which does not include the assignment of codes based on health record data and official coding guidelines
o	Senior Leadership
"	Individuals who are in VA leadership positions and are not included in other groups
o	"Super Users"
"	Individuals who will serve as the primary points of contact for other users
o	Data Users
"	Individuals who are downstream database owners, analysts, and program offices receiving ICD 10 coded data for statistical and aggregation purposes

Contractors will also be expected to develop methods to:
"	Ensure training for VHA employees is complete at least 90 days prior to the ICD-10 transition date  (NOTE: the estimated VHA 175,000 employees required to be trained will be staggered through the period of contract performance as per the VA training plan.  All training is anticipated to begin with the "Super Users" group).
"	Track and maintain a record of training attendance/completion
"	Establish and submit realistic target outcomes and end results for each training course and for each audience
"	Develop several reliable ways to measure these target outcomes (i.e. provide a method to determine whether the training was useful, relevant, and appropriate for the given audiences)
"	Establish target goals for each measure and describe methods in which these goals will be achieved
"	Develop a system to continually analyze and adjust training material to meet the goals to successfully train VA personnel

This is being done as it would prohibitively expensive replace the Matlab software ARIEM currently uses with another of comparable nature, it would reduce efficiency as the current users would have to retrain with the new software, and all old files would have to be converted and would require verifying the existing code-base and data sets to any replacement environment.<br>The proposed contract action is for supplies which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). This notice of intent to purchase supplies from only one source is not a request for proposals; however interested persons may submit their capability to respond to this requirement to the point of contact listed below by March 23, 2012.<br>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p>The U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Retirement Services, Benefits Officers Training and Development (BOTD) will hold its 2012 Federal Benefits Conference: Benefits Roundup in Dallas, Texas on June 4-8, 2012, at the Sheraton Dallas Downtown Hotel located at 400 North Olive Street, Dallas, Texas 75201. This year the Benefits Conference will have a vendor exhibit area on June 6 and 7. The purpose of the training is to update the group on initiatives in the benefits area, share information among agencies about actions some have taken to deal with benefits education, increased workloads, etc., and address crosscutting issues in retirement, insurance, Social Security, workers compensation, and Thrift Savings Plan administration. In addition, this year's event will feature a 2 &frac12; day conference, Benefits Roundup Conference (held on June 6 and 7 and &frac12; day on the 8th), which will include the 6th Annual Symposium on Retirement Financial Education and Federal retirement and benefits related plenary and breakout sessions. This 2 &frac12; day Federal Benefits: Benefits Roundup will have general sessions of interest to all, providing an overview of our retirement financial education programs as well as news and updates on current Federal benefits programs. In the past approximately a third of the attendees were Federal agency headquarters level staff with responsibility for administering the benefits programs within their agencies. The other attendees were field staff with benefits administration responsibilities at the field level. We anticipate approximately 450 agency representatives to attend this event.</p>
<p>Up to 30 exhibit spaces are available. Exhibitors will rent the space directly from Power Train Inc, who is acting on OPM's behalf to manage the exhibit booths and facilitate set up and dismantle with the on-site display company. The rental application and payment will be submitted to Power Train. Power Train will accept payment by check, VISA or MasterCard.</p>
<p>Exhibit spaces will be allocated on a first come first served basis. Registration must be received by May 4, 2012. The exhibit area will be in the Grand Hall on the 1st floor of the Hotel. Exhibitors may set up beginning at 8:30 am, June 6th. Exhibits must be removed by 4:00pm June 7th. Sessions in the Ballroom begin at 8:30 am each day and end at 4:30 pm. The attendees will have a number of opportunities to visit the exhibit area on June 6th and 7th. The staffed exhibit booths will be 8' by 10' with pipe and drape and will include signage, an electrical outlet, one table and two chairs. The cost of a staffed exhibit booth is $ 1,175.00 for an 8' by 10' booth. Any other items needed for your booth; such as, VCR/DVD with monitor, phone line, internet access, etc., are available for an extra charge. You must notify Power Train of any additional requests. <br />There is limited space available after the daily sessions (between 4:30 - 6:00 pm) for vendors to provide activities for attendees supporting the HealthierFeds initiatives. These activities could include workshops on healthy eating; demonstration activities such as aerobics, Pilates or stretching programs; sample health assessments; sample work site audits; or similar activities. The exhibitor cost is $750 to sponsor one of these activities. This fee covers the cost of the room for the session and placement of a vendor provided poster (maximum size 24' by 30") in the Ballroom Foyer area during registration on Sunday evening and all day Monday through Thursday.</p>
<p>Participation in the exhibit area does not mean that the U.S. Office of Personnel Management in any way endorses or approves the vendor or its products or services. Exhibitors may not represent in any way that their participation at the Benefits Training event represents any endorsements or approval by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</p>

<DESC>NASA/JSC is requesting information from industry regarding potential organizationalconflicts of interest (OCI) arising from the Human Health and Performance Contract(HHPC).The nature of the work anticipated under HHPC may create a situation, where there couldbe a potential for an OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Each potentialofferor should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASAs anticipation of OCI issues andconsider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision tocompete for the HHPC.Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under HHPC will include the followingtypes of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  This list is not all inclusive. Regulatory oversight responsibilities for other contractors at Johnson Space Center; Assessment of component and system designs, analysis, and models developed for theOrion/Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV);  Assessment of component and system designs, analysis, and models developed for theInternational Space Station (ISS) or Extravehicular Activities (EVA);  Assessment of component and system designs, analysis, and models developed for thecommercial crew or cargo providers;  Assessment of hardware designs, analysis, models developed for the JSC Space LifeSciences Directorate and/or the Engineering Directorate by Contractors, Grantees, andSpace Act Agreement Participants other than the HHPC Contractor;  Assessment of new technology disclosures (aka invention disclosures) including, forexample, new and novel hardware, software, processes, and composition of matter submittedby Contractors, Grantees, and Space Act Agreement Participants other than the HHPCContractor; Access to Government Sensitive Information such as pre-decisional informationassociated with on-going or future NASA projects that may result in future competitiveprocurements; Access to a Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participants proprietaryinformation, where said Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participant is notthe HHPC Contractor; Design, development, test and evaluation including certification and fabrication ofhardware including flight hardware and software. These types of tasks could lead to the following categories of OCI issues depending onthe composition of the team selected for the HHPC contract:  Unequal access to nonpublic information of the type that may provide the HHPCContractor an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a governmentprocurement contract; Potential impaired objectivity if the HHPC contractor or its subcontractors areassessing data developed by themselves, related companies (e.g., affiliates, jointventures, partnerships, etc.), or subcontractors; Potential impaired objectivity if the HHPC contractor or its subcontractors or relatedcompanies are responsible for assessing or performing safety and mission assurance forhardware or data generated by the HHPC contractor, its subcontractors, or relatedcompanies under another JSC contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or Space ActAgreement; Potentially creating biased ground rules by providing technical assessments to NASA onspecific technologies and methodologies that may affect NASAs preparation of aspecification of work, other contractual requirements, or NASAs evaluation of proposalsin a future competitive procurements. A link to the NASA Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest has been posted to theHHPC procurement website at:  http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/hhpc    .  Please referencethis document for additional information about NASAs policies with respect to OCIissues.  You are requested to provide electronic responses via e-mail to the ContractingOfficer listed at the end of this synopsis.  Your response is requested by 5:00 p.m.local time on March 30, 2012.  Potential offerors are requested to address the followingquestions: 1. What type of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, shouldyou choose to propose on the HHPC contract? 2. What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that youidentified (if any)?  Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience withother contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc.3. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed HHPC contract thatwere not identified in this RFI?4. Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the HHPC that would cause youto decide not to propose on the potential HHPC RFP?NASA intends to assess any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offerorsproposed OCI mitigation strategy, responding to each company who submits a mitigationstrategy in writing.  NASAs response will simply be an attempt to preliminarily examinepossible circumstances which might lead to or eliminate an OCI.  It will not be aconfirmation that, in fact, an OCI will ultimately exist or that an offeror cansuccessfully eliminate or mitigate an OCI.  Furthermore, the response in no way alters orinterprets the application of FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or afinal proposal submission, should a potential offeror elect to submit a proposal inresponse to an RFP issued under a solicitation for HHPC.  Subsequent to the initialsubmission and response, the Government will not consider further information as itrelates to this RFI.The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes,to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only.	NASA willnot affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public,but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy,and therefore such information may be recognizable to the potential offeror who submittedit.  Any information submitted in response to this RFI that is marked as ConfidentialCommercial or Financial Information will be considered as voluntarily submitted inaccordance with the Freedom of Information Act.The Government intends to release the names, addresses, and points of contact of allrespondents unless specifically requested not to do so by the respondent.  All questionsshould be directed to the point of contact identified below.  In accordance with FAR15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by theGovernment to form a binding contract.

<DESC><strong>Description</strong>: This is a Request for Information (RFI) notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.
<p>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, NC, is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of businesses to provide a unified communications system. The NAICS Code is 334210 with a Size Standard of 1,000 Employees.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) seeks to replace its current telecommunications equipment with a unified communications system which may utilize voice over IP. The purpose of the request for information is to gauge the capabilities of the vendor community to provide both equipment and services to the NIEHS. Specific Information as to the functionality sought is listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The NIEHS currently utilizes a private branch exchange (PBX) and is connected to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) via trunk lines. The current NIEHS telephone system operates on a DMS100 switch located at the off-site central office of the local service provider. These trunk lines are provided by Frontier Communications Company (http://www.frontier.com). The current phone system provides almost 2000 telephone lines and incorporates digital telephones, analog telephones, fax machines, and some modems. The NIEHS uses Polycom (http://www.polycom.com) conference phone devices for some conference calling requirements. In addition there are other services such as ISDN and DSL lines to support video conferencing equipment, which is not integrated into the telephone system.</p>
<p>Video conferencing equipment is supported at the NIEHS through a separate system which uses Tandberg (http://www.tandberg.com) equipment and ISDN lines separate from the NIEHS network.</p>
<p>The NIEHS local area network is currently being migrated from a mixed vendor installation to a homogeneous Cisco (http://www.cisco.com) network. Most NIEHS communications closets will utilize a Cisco Catalyst 4507R device to distribute to laboratories, office spaces and other public areas. These will be aggregated back to Cisco Catalyst 6509 devices. Internet connectivity to the NIEHS is provided by TW Telecom (http://www.twtelecom.com).</p>
<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

If no written responses are received at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this response, the additonal purchase will be awarded without further notice.  <br><br>Questions and comments pertaining to this proposed modification shall be emailed to Craig.E.Anderson@amedd.army.mil.

AFMETCAL at Heath OH intends to award a firm fixed price contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, for the purchase of 50 GHz Power Standards with Five-year extended warranty, and technical manuals.

<p>The current versions of the following clauses apply to this acquisition and are incorporated by reference: <br />FAR 52.203-3 Gratuities;<br />FAR 52.203-6 Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government, with Alternate I; <br />FAR 52.204-10 Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards;<br />FAR 52.209-6 Protecting the Governments Interest When Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment;<br />FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items;<br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items - (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1. Technical, Capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirements as stated in the purchase description; 2. Past Performance, Expectation the Government has that the offeror will be able to successfully complete the required effort; and 3. Price. Award will be made to the responsible technically acceptable offeror who conforms to all of the solicitation requirements, has the lowest total evaluated price, and has affirmatively demonstrated responsibility through past performance. Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. All offeror's shall provide with their proposal, descriptive literature, brochures, and technical proposal response. Offerors must submit sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc., in order for the Government to make an adequate technical assessment of the proposed unit. Award will be based on technical acceptability (acceptable or not acceptable), past performance (confidence or no confidence), and price. Technical acceptability will be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in response to this request for proposal. The technical proposal response shall include a written line-by-line response to each paragraph number of the purchase description. A simple statement of compliance is not acceptable. Where the technical literature demonstrates that the proposed unit meets the requirement of a specific purchase description paragraph you may reference that page and paragraph of the technical literature in your technical response in lieu of restating it. Past performance will be evaluated based on information submitted (3 recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items) in accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and information obtained from the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), including information linked to FAPIIS such as from the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) and the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The Government reserves the right to use performance information from other sources such as Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), Fee Determining Officials, or commercial sources. Offerors shall be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to respond to the information. The total evaluated price will be calculated as follows:<br />(1) The evaluated price will be the unit price proposed multiplied by the specified unit quantity (e.g. 1 EACH),<br />(2) For the option units where there is a quantity range, the evaluated price will be the unit price proposed multiplied by the maximum quantity in that range.<br />(3) The sum of all CLINs (Basic Year and Options) will represent the total evaluated price.<br />(4) Offeror's are advised that the evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise such options.<br />FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, with Alternate I. Each offeror shall include a completed copy of this provision. Offerors shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov .

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p><br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
<p>Online Protected Species Workshop: Hosting Services</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Pacific Islands Regional Office, Sustainable Fisheries Division (SFD) administers protected species workshops (PSW) for owners and captains of western Pacific pelagic longline vessels. The workshops are mandatory, and a valid workshop certificate is necessary for an owner to renew a longline fishing permit. The workshop training includes protected species identification, handling and release techniques, and regulatory requirements. The workshop is required annually, and each year about 200 fishermen and vessel owners are trained in Hawaii, and 100 are trained in American Samoa. Staff from SFD conducts the workshops. Online training is offered as an alternative to classroom training sessions. The existing online courseware covers the same topics as the classroom sessions. Online learners are tested, and after successful completion of the course modules and tests, they are issued a PSW certificate. The online system also houses a database for administrative and tracking purposes. The online course contains approximately 140 screens, plus the test section. The average learner takes from two to four (2 to 4) seat-hours to complete the course. The course is Adobe Flash-based SCORM 2004 compliant.</p>
<p>NEED FOR WORK AND CONTRACTOR'S CAPABILITY</p>
<p>SFD requires the services of a Learning Management System (LMS) provider to host the online course for a period of one year, with possible extensions up to a total of three years. The course must be available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year without interruption. Any deviation from this commitment must be agreed to in advance. To achieve this task, the Contractor must have knowledge, expertise, and experience in hosting SCORM 2004 courses.</p>
<p>PROJECT TASKS, DELIVERABLES, AND MONITORING</p>
<p>The Contractor will be SCORM 2004 Certified. The Contractor will be solely responsible for importing the legacy SCORM 2004 compliant course into the LMS platform, to include any programmatic or other alterations that may be necessary. The Contractor will explain how it manages the registration and delivery of online training for users, how it updates new version deployments, automates the administration, tracking, and reporting of training conducted, and how it sends data from client to server.</p>
<p>The Contractor will explain in detail how existing user and training records on the current LMS host will be migrated to the Contractor's system, including the communications plan between the Contractor's and the current LMS host' technical teams. The Contractor will be responsible for any and all costs pertaining to communications and tasks between the legacy hosting vendor and the Contractor. The data migration plan will include the mapping of data entity and elements, the approach to content and customer migration, i.e., manual, automated, or mixed, and any significant risks in data migration include the loss of data.</p>
<p>The Contractor will demonstrate its financial capability and stability by providing a brief corporate history and any other applicable supporting information. The Contractor will describe its customer support philosophy and commitments to high quality services to SFD.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be able to demonstrate the ability to provide the required services by providing at least three references of current customers for which similar hosting services are being provided, including dates of service, brief description of products and services, number of online learners, institution name, and point of contact information. The Contractor will demonstrate their experience by providing live links to actual or demonstration systems that indicate the vendor's capabilities to deliver the required hosting service.</p>
<p>The Contractor will specify the proposed costs separately for year 1, and additional costs for possible additional years 2 and 3. NMFS expects the costs for years 2 and 3 to be lower than year 1, because migration and start-up will have been completed.</p>
<p>The Contractor's performance will be monitored and evaluated by SFD. The performance evaluation will be prepared according to the guidelines provided in DAO-216-13, "Evaluation of the Results of Advisory and Assistance Contracts."</p>
<p>SELECTION CRITERIA</p>
<p>The successful proposal will be selected based on the following criteria and relative importance:<br />1. Technical proposal, no more than 10 pages, that describes how the Contractor would successfully complete the project (30%);<br />2. Documented successful past work performance related to hosting online courses for other U.S. government agencies (60%); and<br />3. Price (10%).</p>
<p>SCHEDULE OF WORK</p>
<p>SFD will provide the Contractor with deadlines for all tasks as mutually agreed to with the Contractor. Deadlines are subject to change. Completion of the services and deliverables for specific tasks is contingent on SFD providing information to the Contractor in a timely manner. Delay in receipt of such information may cause unavoidable delays in deliverables under this Contract. Adjustments in work schedule and project tasks may be made by mutual consent.</p>
<p>SCHEDULE OF PAYMENT</p>
<p>SFD will pay the Contractor in five separate installments:</p>
<p>1st Installment: 20% of the contract amount will be paid after SFD verifies that the online PSW course has passed functional tests and is fully operational.<br /><br />2nd Installment: 20% of the contract amount will be paid after successful live hosting for month 1-3 of the 1-year contact term, and SFD is satisfied that all projects tasks, deliverables and monitoring expectation re being met.</p>

The past performance will be evaluated on:<br />i. Quality of Product/Service<br />ii. Similarity of products manufactured to the proposed<br />iii. Timeliness of Performance<br />iv. Overall Satisfaction Rating</p>
<p>Offerors without any record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. <br /><br />(ii) Price<br /><br />Total Price - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the offeror's proposed total price for the basic requirement (CLIN 0001) plus all proposed option total prices (CLINs 0002 thru 0006).</p>
<p>b. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.</p>
<p>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>Representations and Certifications:<br /><br />All offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items (Feb 2012).

<p>HOST AGENCY CHECK<br />Security Requirements Overview</p>
<p>1. Local national contractor employees requiring access to United States Air Force-occupied United Kingdom bases must comply with Third Air Force Instruction 31-501, and all local Security Forces requirements. This is an overview and does not contain all the specifics contained in the Instruction.</p>
<p>2. New contractor employees may be escorted onto the installation, only, to fill out paperwork. The employee is not to start work until all required paperwork has been submitted to the appropriate office.</p>
<p>3. Prior to beginning employment on the installation, individuals must, at a minimum, have a completed Local Files Check (LFC). Individuals with LFCs are required to be escorted by an authorized US citizen (reference Instruction 31-501 for US citizen clearance requirements) or a local national with a Security Check (SC) who has escort authority.</p>
<p>4. Unescorted access requires a Host Agency Check (HAC). There are two levels of background investigations that meet the standards that meet this requirement. The level of background check required, will depend on whether the position is considered sensitive or non-sensitive.</p>
<p>a. The Counter Terrorist Check (CTC). The CTC is a national-level security and police background investigation conducted by the DVA. This is the minimum check required for all contractor/subcontractor employees in non-sensitive positions requiring unescorted installation access. The CTC expires three years from the issue date.</p>
<p>b. The Security Check (SC). The SC includes all of the elements of the CTC but is a more comprehensive investigation and includes such actions as a credit check, interviewing relatives, determining and evaluating the individual's involvement in various organizations, verifying any past military experience, etc. This is the minimum check required for employees and contractor personnel in sensitive positions. Most SCs expire five years from the issue date.</p>
<p>5. Individuals employed in sensitive positions may only be assigned to and or perform the non-sensitive portion of the position until the SC is positively completed or they must be provided with direct supervision by a U.S. citizen or an individual with a completed SC.</p>
<p>6. Investigation renewal. All employees renewing their background investigation will complete an MOD Form 1109, Security Questionnaire. On the front cover of the form, under General Details, the employee will mark the appropriate block indicating a security questionnaire has been completed before and will complete the form with current information. Renewal paperwork should be submitted 6 months prior to the current background expiration date to avoid a possible lapse in installation access.</p>
<p>7. Functional Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP) will be the point-of-contact for processing security clearances. They will provide necessary documents to contractor employees, compile completed forms, submit documents to Security Forces, and sign USAFE Form 79. The following must be accomplished &lsquo;in-turn' for all new contractor employees.</p>
<p>Contractor will provide the following to QAP:</p>
<p>-Completed LCF (conducted by HAC Office)<br />-Completed MOD Form 1109, Security Questionnaire (required for CTC or SC; completed by unit<br />submitter)<br />-Completed USAFE Form 19, Residency Check for Employment with United States Air Forces in Europe<br />-Completed AF Form 2583, Request for Personnel Security Action<br />-Completed USAFE Form 79, Application for Base Entry Identification (completed by unit submitter)<br />-Completed Basic Check Verification Record (BCVR) (verified and signed by unit submitter)</p>
<p>8. Upon receipt of a favourable HAC and all required documentation, the contractor employee will be issued a USAFE Form 77 which must be in the employee's possession at all times while on the installation. The expiration date of the Form 77 will be the contract expiration date or one year, whichever is shorter. The contractor is responsible for collecting and turning in to the QAP, all Form 77s for employee who are no longer in their employment</p>

The rights and remedies of the NAFI provided in this clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.<br />8. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE (JAN 2005) The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the NAFI. If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract's date. To the extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2.<br />9. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT (JAN 2005) - Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract.<br />10. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE (JAN 2005) <br />a. (1) The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to-<br /><br />(i) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any Extension;<br />(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a) (2) below); or <br />(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a) (2) below).<br />(2) The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.<br />b. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.<br />c. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.<br />d. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any<br />(1) Completed supplies, and<br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.<br />e. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.<br />f. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.<br />g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.<br />11. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE (Nov 2011) - Inspection and acceptance will be at destination, unless otherwise provided in this contract. Notwithstanding the requirements for any NAFI inspection and test contained in specifications applicable to this contract, except where specialized inspections or tests are specified for performance solely by the NAFI, the Contractor, shall perform or have performed the inspections and tests required to substantiate that the supplies provided under the contract conform to the drawings, specifications, and contract requirements listed herein, including if applicable the technical requirements for the manufacturers' part numbers specified herein. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. Acceptance of the supplies or services or a written notice of rejections must be accomplished on or before the third working day following delivery of the supplies or services, unless otherwise specified in this contract.<br />12. VARIATION IN QUANTITY (JAN 2005) No variation in quantity of any item called for by this contract will be accepted unless authorized by the Contracting Officer.<br />13. PARTIAL DELIVERIES (JAN 2005) - Partial deliveries are not permitted unless authorized by the terms of the contract or approved by the Contracting Officer.<br />14. PAYMENTS (JAN 2005) - Partial payments will be made when deliveries are authorized or as approved by the Contracting Officer. Payments and penalties for late payments are subject to the requirements established by the Prompt Payment Act, as amended, and as implemented for NAFI's. If the NAFI makes payment but such payment fails to include a prompt payment penalty due to the Contractor within 10 days from when the contract payment is made, penalty amounts will not be paid unless the Contractor makes a written request within forty days after the date of payment.<br />15. HOLD AND SAVE HARMLESS (JAN 2005) The Contractor shall indemnify, hold and save harmless, and defend the NAFI, its outlets and customers from any liability, claimed or established for violation or infringement of any patent, copyright, or trademark right asserted by any third party with respect to goods hereby ordered or any part thereof. Contractor further agrees to hold the NAFI harmless from all claims or judgments for damages resulting from the use of products or services listed in this contract, except for such claims or damages caused by, or resulting from negligence of NAFI customers, employees, agents, or representatives. Also, Contractor shall at all times hold and save harmless the NAFI, its agents, representatives, and employees from any and all suits, claims, charges, and expenses which arise out of acts or omissions of Contractor, its agents, representatives, or employees.<br />16. MODIFICATIONS (JAN 2005) No agreement or understanding to modify this contract will be binding upon the NAFI unless made in writing and signed by a Contracting Officer from the office that issued the contract or its successor.<br />17. TAXES (JAN 2005) <br />a. Except as may be otherwise provided in this contract, the contract price includes all taxes, duties or other public charges in effect and applicable to this contract on the contract date, except any tax, duty, or other public charge, which by law, regulation or governmental agreement, is not applicable to expenditures made by the NAFI or on its behalf; or any tax, duty, or other public charge from which the Contractor, or any subcontractor hereunder, is exempt by law, regulation or otherwise. If any such tax, duty, or other public charge has been included in the contract price, through error or otherwise, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced.<br />b. If for any reason, after the contract date of execution, the Contractor or subcontractor is relieved in whole or in part from the payment or the burden of any tax, duty, or other public charge included in the contract price, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced; or if the Contractor or subcontractor is required to pay in whole or in part any tax, duty, of other public charge which was not applicable at the contract date of execution the contract price shall be correspondingly increased.<br />18. PROOF OF SHIPMENT (JAN 2005) (Applicable to shipments outside the United States through the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) and Parcel Post shipments to overseas destinations.)<br />a. Notwithstanding any clause of this contract to the contrary, payment will be made for items not yet received, upon receipt of an invoice accompanied by an appropriate proof of shipment. If shipment is made by insured parcel post, the contractor must furnish a copy of the Insured Mail Receipt issued by the US Postal Service. Otherwise, a stamped copy of a Certificate of Mailing issued by the US Postal Service must be furnished. If shipment is made by a common carrier (rail, air or motor freight), the Contractor must furnish a signed copy of the shipping document on which items are receipted for by the common carrier. A signed receipt by a NAFI representative at the delivery point (CCP or POE) is also acceptable evidence of proof of shipment.<br />b. Forwarding a proof of shipment and an invoice for payment by the Contractor shall be construed as a certification by the contractor that the items shipped conform to the specifications.<br />c. Notwithstanding any provisions of this clause or any payment made pursuant to the terms of this clause prior to receipt of the items contracted for, the NAFI retains the right to inspect upon receipt and the right to reject nonconforming items. The liability of the Contractor with respect to items for which payments have been made will, after inspection by the NAFI or after the expiration of a reasonable time following delivery to the NAFI within which inspection may be made, whichever occurs first, be limited to (i) exceptions taken at the time of inspection, and (ii) latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as amount to fraud. <br />19. COMMERCIAL WARRANTY (JAN 2005) The Contractor agrees that the supplies or services furnished under this contract shall be covered by the most favorable commercial warranties the Contractor gives to any customer for such supplies or services and that the rights and remedies provided herein are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the NAFI by any other clause of this contract. The printed terms and conditions of such warranty will be provided to the NAFI with the delivery of any supplies covered.<br />20. ADVERTISEMENTS (JAN 2005) Contractor agrees that none of its nor its agent's advertisements, to include publications, merchandise, promotions, coupons, sweepstakes, contest, sales brochures, etc, shall state, infer or imply that the Contractor's products or services are approved, promoted, or endorsed by the NAFI. Any advertisement, including cents off coupons, which refers to a NAFI will contain a statement that the advertisement is neither paid for, nor sponsored in whole or in part by, the particular activity.<br />21. DISCOUNTS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT (JAN 2005) <br />a. Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of offers. However, any offered discount will form a part of the award, and will be taken if payment is made within the discount period indicated in the offer by the offeror. As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices. <br />b.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

     (1) Meet the specifications listed in the attached Statement of Work;
     (2) Clearly identify the proposed item by-- 
       (i) Brand name, if any; and
       (ii) Make or model number;
      (3)  Provide the following information related to Factor 2, Technical Approach to demonstrate it meets those specifications described in the Attached Statement of Work.  This information will be used to determine if an offeror's proposal meets the Government's needs:
        (i) Descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and
        (ii) Clear descriptions of any modifications the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Offerors shall mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modifications.
      (4)  Provide past performance information, included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information as outlined in 52.212-2).
(End of Provision)

FAR 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).
(a) Offerors will be evaluated to the extent they can provide software that meets the specifications listed in the attached Statement of Work.  The Government intends to make one (1) award from this RFQ.   The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
Factor 1 - Past Performance
Offerors are required to demonstrate recent (within the last three years), successful performance under 3 contracts (ongoing or completed) which are similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity to the subject requirement. The proposal shall include:
a.	Government Agency/Company which awarded contract to offeror
b.	Contract Number
c.	Description of Contract Scope
d.	Total Dollar Value
e.	Performance Period
f.	Place of Performance
g.	Contracting Officer/Procurement Official
1.	Name
2.	Email
3.	Phone Number
4.	Address

Offeror Past Performance - The offeror's response to this factor will be evaluated as to its relevance and similarity to work under this project.  The Government may contact the offeror's references for information and may review performance ratings on file for prior Government projects the offeror may have performed.  Past performance information obtained from sources other than those identified by the offeror may be used.  All relevant facts and circumstances gathered from information from the offeror's listed references and other sources of information available to the Government (e.g., National Institutes of Health [NIH] Contractor Performance System [CPS] and Past Performance Information Retrieval System [PPIRS]) will be used to evaluate the offeror's overall past performance and quality of performance. If an offeror has not had a chance to comment on negative past performance evaluations obtained by the Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) the offeror may be given a chance during "exchanges" (clarifications, communications, or discussions) after receipt of proposals (FAR 15.306).  If discussions are required, and past performance issues remain, these issues will be addressed during discussions.
Offerors who do not have relevant past performance will receive a neutral rating (neither favorable nor unfavorable).
Factor 2 - Technical Approach
Offer shall meet all specifications in the Attached Statement of Work by providing those documents outlined in section (m) of the Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items.
Factor 3 - Cost/Price
Aggregate price shall also be evaluated for this acquisition.
Award shall be made using the Lowest Price, Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection process.
The Government reserves the right to designate a competitive range, if necessary.  The decision to designate a competitive range will be made solely by the Government.
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
 (d) The Contracting Officer will evaluate proposals on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer.

<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND<br />The US Department of State, (DOS) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs' (INL) mission is to minimize the impact of international crime and illegal drugs on the US and its citizens through global cooperation. INL's Office of the Western Hemisphere Programs (INL/WHP) develops narcotics control and anticrime policy initiatives for countries in the Western Hemisphere who produce and transit narcotics. INL/WHP provides overall program and policy direction for INL bilateral narcotics and anticrime assistance programs at overseas posts by developing and revising drug and crime strategies and coordinating program development with other US agencies.</p>
<p>INL/WHP is responsible for coordinating policy and programs with other US Government (USG) departments and agencies who are involved in international narcotics control and crime activities, including the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), the Departments of Defense (DOD), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Treasury (DOT), and the Agency for International Development (AID).</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of the PSC is to provide a Community Policing Advisor to the Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) at the US Embassy, Guatemala City and Coban, Guatemala. The Advisor will advise on matters related to the development and implementation of community oriented policing, prevention, and operations models for the National Civil Police (NCP).</p>
<p>Relationships <br />&bull; The Advisor will receive general guidance and report to the NAS Police Program Manager. Specific assignments originate frequently from liaison activities; the Advisor will negotiate the draft scope, and objectives of prevention and community-oriented policing related projects independently with slight input / review from the supervisor.<br />&bull; Since the Advisor is located physically in Guatemala, he/she will exercise independent judgment in developing new and improved approaches to analyze and review prevention-oriented programs in Guatemala.</p>
<p>B. STATEMENT OF WORK<br />a. Provide advice and assistance in planning, developing, and administering NAS/Government of Guatemala (GOG) police prevention programs to include community oriented policing and improved patrolling based on computer driven statistical information. <br />b. Assist the US embassy with institutionalizing GOG law enforcement prevention programs and justice sector capabilities to become self-sufficient, ensure US citizen safety, improve law enforcement, and rule of law interests. <br />c. Coordinate the implementation of policies and strategies related to citizen safety, effective and efficient patrolling, community relations, and rule of law. This includes training, strategic planning, setting priorities, and evaluating bilateral programs. <br />d. Initiate studies and advise NAS and GOG partners on strategic planning, leadership, management, and organizational requirements and reforms that affect community-oriented and prevention policing.<br />e. Identify areas for independent, professional evaluations regarding the prevention policing process and the justice sector of Guatemala.

<p>Addenda to 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i) Technical Capabilities<br />a. Experience<br />b. Understanding of the Requirement<br />ii) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capabilities and its sub factors, are significantly more important than price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single Firm Fixed Price contract from this combined synopsis/solicitation.&nbsp; Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior services than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior services. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Technical Capabilities). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES- The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the Offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Proposal. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Part 5 of the SOW. . The government must receive enough information in a proposal to make a determination that the Offeror can complete the defined work or the proposal may be considered non-responsive.</p>
<p>PRICE- The Offeror shall provide a document outlining their pricing using the contract line items listed above. Pricing must be provided separately from your technical proposal.</p>
<p>EVALUATION SUMMARY</p>
<p>FACTOR I - TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES-The Offeror shall submit a proposal that acknowledges the tasks identified in the Statement of Work to allow the Government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of performing the work. <br />Sub factor a. EXPERIENCE-The Offeror shall provide a synopsis of their experience in performing the tasks listed in the Statement of Work.<br />Sub factor b. UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT- The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal acknowledging that they are capable of completing the tasks identified in the Statement of Work, outlining their method and approach to completing the requirements.</p>
<p>FACTOR II - PRICE - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Technical Capabilities follows. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor II, Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:<br />Factor I- Technical Capabilities, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale:<br />Outstanding-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Good-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Acceptable-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Unacceptable-A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Non-Price Factors: The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first: <br />Factor I, Technical Capabilities and its sub factors combined are significantly more important than Factor II "Price". However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor II "Price" becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>Vendors who are exempt from the Service Contract Act must certify that the exemption applies using FAR 52.222-41, 52.222-48, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification.</p>
<p>Quotes must be received by Mindy Smith, Contract Specialist, no later than 3:00 PM (EST) on March 13, 2012. Quotes will be accepted by fax at (304) 256-3332 or e-mail at smith.mindy@dol.gov.

Unless a significant price disparity exists which deems a large business suitable for award, award will be made to a small business. Multiple awards will not be considered. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions, therefore, offerors' initial proposal should contain the best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation offers the Best Value to the Government.  "Best value" means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. In accordance with FAR 12.602, technical (capability of the item offered to meet the agency need), price, and past performance will be evaluated. The Government may consider, among other factors, value indicators such as past performance, special features of the supply or service required for effective program performance, trade-in considerations, probable life of the item, warranty considerations, maintenance availability, environmental and energy efficiency considerations, and delivery terms. The Gov't will review past performance in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 (b)(3)(ii). This may result in award being made to a higher-rated, higher-priced offeror. The Government's selection of a higher-priced, higher rated offer will be supported by a determination that the technical/past performance superiority of the higher-priced offer warrants the additional cost involved. <br><br>52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, 52.212-4 is amended as follows: Paragraph (g) (1): Change requirement for three copies of invoices to 1 copy of invoices.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to include the following line in the MarketySurvey below: "The Army is not requiring current sources to participate forcalibers for which they are already qualified."

DESCRIPTION:  The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey and the Office of theProject Manager for Maneuver Ammunition System are seeking sources interestedin entering into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) withthe U.S. Government on one or more of the following: 
-	5.56mm Rifle Marking Cartridges (for use in the M14 and M16 weapons): A quantity of 60,000 rounds (20,000 of each color) will be required to besubmitted. 
-	5.56mm Saw Linked Marking Cartridges (for use in the M249 weapon):A quantity of 99,000 rounds (33,000 of each color) will be required to besubmitted.
-	9mm Marking Rounds (for use in the M9, M11, and M4 weapons):A quantity of 81,000 rounds (27,000 of each color) will be required to besubmitted. 
The marking rounds (blue/red/yellow) stated above will be used with the CloseCombat Mission Capability Kit (CCMCK).  The marking ammunition shall be areduced-energy, non-lethal cartridge that leaves a bright, water-soluble colormarking compound on target upon impact. The visible impact left by the markingcompound allows for an accurate assessment of simulated lethality and shotplacement.   
In exchange for providing the cartridges, the Government will bear the cost totest the cartridges in accordance with the draft performance specificationsand each offeror will be provided the results of their test.  The cartridgeswill be subject to Proof of Principle (PoP) including preliminary life cycletesting.
NOTE:  Testing of the sample rounds will be immediately and permanentlysuspended in the event that a critical and/or major failure occurs. Offerorscan pay to have the remaining ammo shipped back.  
The information gathered during testing will be used to support thequalification of additional sources.  
The Army is not requiring current sources to participate for calibers forwhich they are already qualified.
All marking rounds stated above will be used with the Close Combat MissionCapability Kit (CCMCK). The CCMCK is a user installed temporary weaponconversion system that allows the Soldier to employ an individual weapon(5.56mm - M4/M16/M249 and 9mm  M9/M11/M4) at short range using low velocitymarking ammunition while precluding the weapon from firing standard serviceammunition.

<DESC>The following changes were made:<br><br>(1) The original posting of the synopsis indicated that the Service Contract Act is applicable.  We believe that the services related to this requirement require the use of Professional Employees, therefore, the Service Contract Act would not be applicable.  <br><br>(2) The place of performance has been updated to show the correct location.  The correct location is: <br>Building 1109<br>Fort Lee, Virginia<br><br>(3) We received questions regarding this requirement.  Please see below for answers to those questions.  <br><br>QUESTION 1: I don't see a requirement for a background check or possible security clearance requirement.  You do specify the IA requirement: DFARS 252.239-7001, Information Assurance Contractor Training and Certification but not a general clearance level, please advise.<br><br>ANSWER 1:  The efforts required for this task are expected to be UNCLASSIFIED and should not require the contract personnel to obtain a security clearance.  However, if the tasking performance requires access to classified data, a security clearance of SECRET will be required for all personnel having access to the classified data and a DD Form 254 will be submitted before work commences.<br><br>QUESTION 2:  Does an accounting system have to be approved prior to submitting proposals or at the time of Contract award?  <br><br>ANSWER 2:  Clause 252.242-7006  " Accounting System Administration"  states "The Contractor shall establish and maintain an acceptable accounting system."  An acceptable accounting system is defined in that clause.  This requirement must be satisfied prior to contract award.  We recommend that if your company does not have an accounting system that was determined to be acceptable in accordance with DFARs 242.75 and Clause 252.242-7006, that you attempt to obtain evidence of an acceptable accounting system, as soon as possible.  <br><br><br>QUESTION 3:  Do you plan on providing the final solicitations only to businesses that respond to the synopsis? <br><br>ANSWER 3:  No, the final solicitation will be posted on the Fedbizopps website, to provide the opportunity for all small businesses to propose. <br>

<DESC>The United States (US) Army has an increasing requirement to provide Force Protection (FP) services at temporary and permanent Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) installations.   Additionally, as the Department of Defense (DOD) draws down forces in support of Operations New Dawn and Enduring Freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan, services will be required for fielded FP systems including associated Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Non-Developmental Items (NDI).  <br>The Product Manager, Force Protection Systems (PdM-FPS) mission includes providing timely, affordable, modular, scalable, supportable and integratable physical security and FP capabilities to tactical forces, military installations and Other Governmental Agencies (OGA).  The PdM-FPS mission includes the requirement to install, operate, de-install/re-install, reconfigure refurbish, retrofit, retrograde, integrate and modify FP systems, equipment and components when and where needed.  Integral to the success of this mission is the ability to compete requirements among qualified contractors in an efficient and timely manner.  PdM-FPS will support the growing demand and complexity of the FP/Physical Security Equipment (PSE) requirements by awarding multiple contracts under this Request for Proposal (RFP).  The objective is to establish long-term, competitively awarded, contracts with continued competition at the Task Order (TO) level.  Each contractor will have a fair opportunity to be considered for all subsequent TO level requirements within the scope of this contract, supporting the range and depth of the required capabilities.  This contract will provide affordable access to FP/PSE services over the Period of Performance (POP).<br>

<DESC>Industry feedback received during the Industry Day event held 5-6 March was extremely beneficial to the Government. The Government will post to FBO the unclassified charts presented during the general session and a list of Industry participants. Please submit all non-proprietary questions from the general session and one-on-one meetings as soon as possible to ensure the Government can consider inputs and publish appropriate responses. To ensure the Government can finalize the Final RFP, all Industry questions related to the Draft RFP must be submitted by 14 March 2012.
<p><br />During the MRBM T1/T2 Industry Day one on one sessions we discovered that Industry has a misconception regarding the use of the SR-19/SR-19 rocket motor configuration. We want to correct the misconception that the Government requires incorporation of the SR-19 rocket motor in proposals. Proposals using SR-19/SR-19 configuration will receive no special advantage in the procurement. The Government will make a best value selection based on the stated requirements of the RFP.<br /><br />The Government currently anticipates release of the RFP during early April, 2012. The Government plans to conduct a pre-proposal conference in Huntsville within two weeks of releasing the RFP.</p>

<p>********************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p><br />I. INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE<br /><br />The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice - Request for Information to increase industry's understanding of TSA's requirement for Program Management Support Services (PMSS) in support of the Office of Security Capabilities (OSC), to improve its understanding of market capabilities and identify qualified vendors that are capable of providing PMSS to OSC, and to accept ideas on how to efficiently and effectively re-compete this requirement.</p>
<p>To help industry better understand the intent of this RFI and the information contained herein, the TSA intends to host an Industry Day at TSA Headquarters in Arlington, VA on March 9, 2012 from 1:30PM - 3:30 PM EST.</p>
<p>All interested and qualified businesses are encouraged to respond to this notice in accordance with the instructions addressed herein.</p>
<p>II. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES<br /><br />The Office of Security Capabilities (OSC), formerly named Office of Security Technology (OST), reports to the Deputy Administrator of the TSA. OSC Directly supports TSA's mission by providing security capabilities to the field. OSC continues to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our nation's transportation systems through the qualification and deployment of security capabilities that drive the global standard for security.</p>
<p>In 2008 and prior there were over a dozen Professional Service type contracts in place to support OSC, which presented a lack of efficiency, scope overlap, and was administratively burdensome. As a result, in 2009 the existing contracts were consolidated into a few primary service type contracts (e.g. Program Management, Engineering, and Testing). As performance under these contracts progressed, these contracts presented a limitation in small business, flexibility, and ability to meet surge requirements so additional "Gap Filler" contracts were awarded. Because one (1) of the Primary Service Type Contracts (i.e. Program Management) is scheduled to end in May 2013, the TSA is taking this as an opportunity to re-evaluate the Program Management and many of the other Professional Service type contracts in place to further improve efficiencies. The TSA is seeking Industry's ideas on how to efficiently and effectively re-compete the Program Management Support Services Contract, while taking into consideration the scope of the other Professional Service type contracts currently in place for OSC.<br /><br />Currently, the TSA has the following enterprise contracts in place for OSC: 1) Program Management Support (GS-10F-06-LP-A0005/ HSTS04-08-F-CT8600); Professional Engineering and Logistics Support Services (PELSS) (HSTS04-10-D-CT7006 and HSTS04-10-D-CT7007); and Test and Evaluation Support Services (TESS) (HSTS04-10-D-ST3065 and HSTS04-10-D-ST3066).&nbsp; In addition to these enterprise contracts, the TSA has several miscellaneous Program Management Support Contracts.</p>

The scope of this contract in support of OSC includes all tasks associated with managing acquisitions, budget activities, developing and evaluating performance goals and measures associated with the programs.</p>

Professional Engineering and Logistics Support Services (PELSS)<br /><br />Professional Engineering and Logistics Support Services is a multiple award IDIQ to two (2) awardees: Global Systems Technologies, Inc. and Quasars, Inc. The total combined value, base + option periods, is $100M. The total POP is April 2010 through April 2015. Specific CLINS are established at the Task Order level on a firm-fixed price or time-and-materials basis.</p>
<p>The awarded PELSS Task Orders provide OSC support with technical assessments/analysis and reports; preparing technical documents; developing technical specifications; performing data collection and analysis, monitoring security equipment performance, configuration management, system design reviews and optimization, cost estimating validation and systems engineering.</p>
<p>C. Test and Evaluation Support Services (TESS)<br /><br />TESS is a multiple award IDIQ to two (2) awardees: Battelle Memorial Institute and TASC, Inc. The total combined value, base + option periods, is $350M. The total POP is September 2010 through September 2015. Specific CLINS are established at the Task Order level on a firm-fixed price or cost plus award fee basis.

The Contractor is responsible for an integrated evaluation strategy, including all data collection and analysis services.</p>
<p>D. Miscellaneous Program Management Support Contracts<br /><br />In addition to the above described enterprise contracts, OSC has several miscellaneous Program Management Support Contracts.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, SAO East/PCO East, St. Louis Contracting Division, 11152 South Towne Square, St. Louis, MO 63125

Agency:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Employee Education Resource Center (EERC), Birmingham, AL

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This justification and approval is for a Sole Source procurement agreement with the International Association of Healthcare Central Service Material Management (IACHSMM), 213 West Institute Place, Suite 307, Chicago, IL 60610.  The proposed contract cost is estimated to be $26,000.00. Intent is to award this as a new, Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order for200 Sets of the Central Service Leadership Manual Boxed Course. Boxed set contains: one textbook and one workbook. The workbook includes chapter by chapter progress quizzes, as well as a final exam. The boxed course (with a textbook and workbook) is the key preparation tool for those studying to becoming Certified in Healthcare Leadership (CHL). Please note, the workbook is not sold separately and must be chosen at the time of purchase of a boxed course.

3.    Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  The purpose of the contract is to provide the training materials necessary for the Certification Training Program for Central Service (CS) professionals with an existing Certified Registered Central Service Technician (CRCST) certification to prepare for supervisory and leadership positions. The CHL Boxed Course contains the materials necessary (including the final exam access) to augment the VA required training through IAHCSMM that will be offered May 7-11, 2012 and August 13-17, 2012. In order to teach an IAHCSMM Course, the Instructor must be IAHCSSM Certified, and is required to use the IAHCSMM copyrighted materials. IAHCSMM Courses have been approved by the Secretary, and is an action item to standardize Supply Processing and Distribution Technicians (SPD) education and certification across the organization. The lack of standardized SPD education and certification were identified on an OIG Report as deficiencies to be corrected. IAHCSMM is the sole distributor of the booksets needed for the curriculum of the program. All three items in the bookset; manual, workbook and quiz packet are required materials for the course.
Estimated value is $26,000.00
Books are required at least 2 weeks before the May 7, 2012 start date to ensure sufficient time for the Project Manager and Project Support people to sort the publications and UPS to the training site. 

4.   Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.    Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):       At the present time, the International Association of Healthcare Central Service Material Management (IACHSMM),  is the only agency able to meet Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requirements. The Central Healthcare Leadership Boxed publication set is only sold through IAHCSMM due to copyrights. Market research showed an ISBN# of 9781450707954 for the 1st Edition Manual, but no sources outside of IAHCSMM (i.e., Amazon Books, Barnes & Noble, BookFinder4U, Google books) were able to provide price, availability, or distributor sources.  The VA has partnered with IAHCSMM for this Certification requirement, and the publications used are proprietary (copyrighted) to IAHCSMM. The IAHCSMM is a national organization and their publications are used as industry standards of practice. In light of the fact that these publications are sold only through the IAHCSMM, pursuing further attempts to find potential sources at this point in time would result in unacceptable delays in providing the VA -mandated training and certification.
 
6.    Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  No efforts were made to solicit other offerors for this procurement as IAHCSMM retains the copyrights to this material.

7.    Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  (Note: the VA is a member of IAHCSMM. The usual price per set is $160.00 - The VA will receive them for $130.00 per set, and for every 10 sets ordered, an additional set is sent for free - so for 200 sets, around 20 additional are received for free so that is a savings of $2,600 - for use in later classes- in addition to the savings of $30 per boxed set, or a savings of $6,000.00.   LINK to IAHCSMM WEBSITE for these books:  http://www.iahcsmm.org/ecommerce/store.php/products/chl-boxed-set


8.    Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Internet Market research was conducted utilizing sites including Amazon books, Google, Barnes and Noble, and BookFinder 4 U. An ISBN search was also conducted via Google and Bing Browsers and no additional providers were found.
 
9.    Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  IAHCSMM retains copyrights to the CHL Booksets and certification exams. 

10.  Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See Section 6 above.

11.  A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  A Sources Sought/RFI could be placed on GSA E-Buy. However, with copyrights and Certification controls for the CHL and related specialties being maintained by IAHCSMM, it may be an academic exercise.  Due to the well-publicized, significant issues VA has experienced with instruments and sterilization processes in a number of healthcare facilities, perhaps the maintenance of one source (IAHCSMM) for the training and certification of these specialties is in the best interest of the VA and it's customers.

12.  Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
