<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

<DESC>NA This solicitation is hereby amended as follows: a. Paragraph 2.14 Site Restrictions was mistakenly removed from the solicitation.   Paragraph 2.14 is hereby reinstated into the solicitation and should read as follows: 2.14 Site Restrictions:  In accordance with 40. U.S.C. 34, Federal Agencies are prohibited from procuring lodging facilities in the District of Columbia without specific authorization and appropriation from Congress.  In addition, the following cities are hereby excluded from consideration, Las Vegas, NV; Reno, NV; Biloxi, MS; Atlantic City, NJ; New Orleans, LA; San Diego, CA; Milwaukee, WI; and Dallas, TX.  The MTMC Symposium conference was held in Dallas, TX in 2001 and is scheduled to be held in Dallas, TX in 2002. b. Paragraph 2.19, Gaming and Labor City is hereby removed in its entirety. c. The following paragraph is hereby added to the solicitation: 13.7 Facility Restrictions.  For information purposes, the Offeror shall identify any limitations and restrictions imposed should the Government determine it necessary to initiate and/or execute the following: -Adjust or change set-ups in meeting rooms. -Set up or pull down exhibit booths. -Place signage in the facility. -Load or off-load materials and equipment from a vehicle at the loading dock. -Remove, place, set, and/or plug into electric outlets computers or equipment. -Installation and/or disconnect telephone or T-1 lines. -Use government personnel, representatives or professional crews in conjunction with the execution of the symposium. d. Clause 52.222-1, Notice to the Government of Labor Disputes. (2/97) is hereby inserted into the solicitation and should read as follows: 52.222-1 Notice to the Government of Labor Disputes.  Notice To the Government of Labor Disputes (Feb 1997) If the Contractor has knowledge that any actual or potential labor dispute is delaying or threatens to delay the timely performance of this contract, the Contractor shall immediately give notice, including all relevant information, to the Contracting Offic er.                                 (End of clause) e. The following are responses to questions received from industry: 1. Question:  The RFP, page 52, 2.8, states in addition, the military services will host tack-on meetings prior and post to the symposium.  Does a bidder need to include cost in the business proposal for such meetings?  If so, how many meetings, how many p articipants, and are there any AV, meals or other requirements? Response:  All meetings are inclusive in the solicitation.  See the CLINS for a breakout of AV and or other requirements. 2. Question:  Even with the new January 7, 2002 due date, the timeframe is restrictive.  The extended due date for questions, with the influence of two holidays, make the response time available for development of a proposal-one fairly dependent on respons es from vendors to contractors-very challenging.  Is the January 7th extension absolute? Response:  See paragraph f below. 3. Question:  Is the response to questions number 18 and 19 in modification 2 regarding handling registration differently than discussed in the RFP absolute? Response:  Yes 	f.  The receipt date for proposals has been extended until 14 January 2002 at 10:00 a.m.   The cut-off date for questions has been extended until 10 January 2002 at 10:00 a.m.

<DESC>DESC: New sources sought: During the calendar quarter ending
DEC 2001, the Defense Information Technology Contracting
Organization-Pacific (DITCO-PAC) contracted with suppliers
of communication services (generally common commercial carriers)
on behalf of Department and Agencies within the Department
of Defense, the Federal Aviation Administration and various
other Government agencies for lease of communication services
and equipment at locations within the State of Hawaii and within
the Pacific area. The service requirements include a wide     spectrum of communication services, ranging from narrow band     (voice grade) to wide band (56kbps and greater), voice and data,   switch and dedicated services, and equipment. These leased   services are generally point-to-point dedicated private line   communication with two (2) service terminals located on military   or other  Government property. To the maximum extent possible,   DITCO leases all components of each individual   telecommunications service requirement (including transmission   facilities and customer premise equipment) from a single source.   During the past quarter approximately 12 services were awarded.   The average monthly recurring charge per award was $19,172.00.

<SUBJECT>D -- FirstGov Search Services
<DESC>The General Services Administration, Office of FirstGov, has a requirement for FirstGov Search Services.  Specifically, FirstGov provides a single high-level portal to all Federal and State Government websites.  As one service of FirstGov, a search capability is provided to allow users to locate content on Government websites.  The current contract for search technology is expiring in the near future.  This procurement is intended to provide replacement search capabilities and to add additional search functionality that has been requested by the agency clients.


The contractor shall provide the following services:

Organization of SOW & Responses
Instructions to Responders
Responses
Responses to the SOW should be divided into three sections: Required Services and Capabilities, Desirable Services and Capabilities, and Supporting Materials.  Responders are instructed to provide succinct responses that describe the specific terms, performance specifications, etc. that substantiate the responder?s claim to meet the requirement.  References to supporting materials to provide further context are encouraged.
Term of Contract
This contract will be for a term of one year.  The Government may choose to extend the contract for up to 4 additional option years, with renewal on a yearly basis.  The Government will notify the vendor in writing of its intent to extend, a minimum of 30 days in advance of the current expiration period.
Evaluation Criteria
The winning proposal will be evaluated on technical capability, completeness of solution, past performance, and price.  Proposals will first be checked to make sure that they meet the Mandatory Qualifications. Any proposals that do not meet the Mandatory Qualifications will not be considered further.
The technical proposal will be evaluated separately from the cost proposal. The Government will evaluate each technical response item and assign a numerical value that indicates the degree to which the Government believes that the response meets/exceeds the requirement.   This numerical value will be multiplied by a predetermined "importance factor" that indicates the relative importance of the particular requirement to the Government.  The sum of the values derived from this calculation will be used as the total point score to rank the technical proposals.  Technical proposals that are in the top 25% of point scores for required functionality will move forward to the cost evaluation phase.
Cost proposals will be evaluated on a total cost for the projected 5 year life of the contract, using a "time value of money" calculation, such that costs in early years are considered to be more expensive than the same dollar costs that occur in later years.
The Government reserves the right to choose not to accept any of the proposals.
Completeness of Solution
It is possible that no single vendor will be able to provide a solution that fully addresses all of the required services and capabilities of Section One of this Statement of Work.  Because the various requirements will have different relative importance in the evaluation, the Government may choose a solution that does not fully address all of the Required Services and Capabilities, but is still, in the opinion of the Government, the best overall solution. In this case, the Government may elect to meet these requirements using other resources outside the scope of this procurement. Mandatory Qualifications, which if not met, will disqualify the proposal from further consideration, are clearly identified in the Statement of Work.
Assumptions
For pricing purposes the following assumptions should be used:
