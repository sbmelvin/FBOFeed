The contractor will be required to build a maintenance shelter in accordance with the technical drawing package and revise the drawing package to include mandated engineering design changes. The contractor is obliged to upgrade the electrical equipment to current Government standards and improve the structure of the maintenance shelter as identified in the SOW. Additionally, a new technical order will be required in line with DOD formatting standards. Preproduction unit testing will need Government approval to proceeding to full rate production.

This acquisition will be set-aside 100% for small business only. Two preproduction units will be required during the basic period.

<DESC>The U. S. Army Contracting Command, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) has a requirement for a Navy Medicine R&D (NAVMEDRAD) contract to provide acquisition personnel and acquisition process infrastructure services.  These services will facilitate Navy Medicine's mission to award Research & Development (R&D) contracts and assistance agreements across the Navy Medicine enterprise, including commands that NHRC reports to or supports (e.g., BUMED, OASD-Health Affairs, etc.).  In addition to providing personnel, this requirement addresses acquisition process infrastructure (such as requirements definition, acquisition package development, and acquisition document administration).  An Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) restriction does apply because this contract is intimately tied to requirements definition and acquisition package development (which includes development of Statement of Objectives and Independent Government Cost Estimates).  <br><br>The mission of Navy Medicine is to provide high quality, economical health care to beneficiaries in wartime and in peacetime.  Highly trained Navy Medicine personnel deploy with Sailors and Marines worldwide, providing critical mission support aboard ship, in the air, and on the battlefield.  Additionally, Navy Medicine's military and civilian health care professionals are providing care for uniformed services' family members and retirees at military treatment facilities around the globe.  Facility & employee security clearance is required at the SECRET level. <br><br>The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery contract vehicle in which Firm-Fixed-Price Delivery Orders may be issued within a three year ordering period.  The guaranteed minimum order will be the negotiated value of the first delivery order, and the cumulative total of all Delivery Orders awarded shall not exceed $32,000,000 over the life of the contract. <br><br>The Government envisions that only one award will be made, however, the Government reserves the right to make more than one award or no awards at their discretion.  NAICS Code 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, applies with a small business size standard of $7.0M.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source:

The Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection intend to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to the Raytheon Company for the procurement of SeaVue Radar systems and technical support services.  This is a non-competitive contract action under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii)  only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements considered as a logical follow on.  The SeaVue Radar is part of the Office of Air and Marine (OAM) avionics operational inventory and established aircraft configuration baseline.  Related efforts performed by the Raytheon Company while supporting the Ocean Surveillance Initiative (OSI) using an OAM DHC-8 aircraft configured with the SeaVue Radar system resulted in the development of advanced radar software and processing upgrades making this a logical follow on.  This action provides for the procurement of SeaVue Radar systems, spares, subcomponents, technical and repair services, technical data, and software upgrade and production support services.  The SeaVue Radar system will be supplied as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to support DHC-8 production line, ongoing P-3 aircraft operational enhancements and introduced as mission sensor for the Predator B Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS).  This notice is neither a request for proposal nor and invitation for bids.  However, sources responding to this synopsis prior to the close of business of the response date will be evaluated for systems availability in meeting the Office of Air and Marine (OAM) requirements.  There is no formal solicitation available for this requirement at this time.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Raytheon Company directly.  See Numbered Note 22.

<CONTACT>Jason Lee, CFA, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-baa-11-08@ugov.gov
<DESC>SYNOPSIS <br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Markets Analysis and Testing of Contextual Hypotheses Enhancement System (MATCHES) Program on July 14, 2011, in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:30 AM to 4:00 PM in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference will be to provide introductory information on MATCHES and the research problems that the program aims to address, to respond to questions from potential proposers, and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities and find potential team partners. This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.
<p><br />PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS<br />Every day there are billions of transactions in the worldwide public financial markets. These transactions cover multiple asset classes, and each transaction can itself be a complex financial instrument. The records of these transactions are used extensively within the financial industry. The financial industry has developed highly sophisticated technologies for market analysis, providing proprietary capabilities that directly support business interests in their highly competitive real-time environment.</p>
<p>Intelligence Community (IC) analysts who work with such market-based financial information must deal with these massive data volumes but have few computational tools to assist them. The role of these analysts is typically to provide insights into the financial context of a specific event that has taken place somewhere in the world. As such, they usually work with historical data to identify relevant facts and then to explore alternative hypotheses to understand those facts. The technologies in use in the financial industry are generally not very useful for IC analysts' tasks.</p>
<p>The MATCHES Program seeks to provide IC analysts with tools to help them quickly explore massive financial data in order to identify, retrieve and analyze those data that are relevant to a particular task. The Program expects to utilize scientific research results and techniques in multiple areas including but not limited to: mathematical &amp; behavioral modeling/finance/economics, econometrics, management science, quantitative investment analysis, financial engineering, applied mathematics, computer science and statistics.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION <br />Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm EST, July 8, 2011, at the following website: https://conference.brtrc.com/MATCHES_pd/Overview.aspx. Directions to the conference facility and other materials are available on the website. No walk-in registrations will be allowed. Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 120 registrants and to no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government-issued photo identification to enter the conference. Foreign nationals will need to present a passport.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />The late morning and afternoon will include Presentation &amp; Poster sessions to provide an opportunity for attendees to present their organizations' capabilities and to explore teaming arrangements. Details on the presentation and poster formats, and the procedure for submitting a request to present, will be provided after approval to register for the conference has been granted. Time available for presentations and posters will be limited. Therefore, presentations will be limited to the first 15 registered respondents who request an oral presentation, and posters will be limited to the first 15 registered respondents who request a poster presentation. These presentations are not intended to solicit feedback from the Government, and Government personnel will not be present during the presentations.</p>
<p>This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated BAA. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA or participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers' Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete.</p>
<p>IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this conference.</p>
<p>Questions concerning conference &amp; registration can be sent to IARPAevents@brtrc.com</p>
<p>Questions regarding the program can be sent to dni-iarpa-baa-11-08@ugov.gov</p>

<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>The Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch (HCIRB) intends to promote measure standardization and data harmonization by engaging the extramural community in some of its key initiatives; specifically, HINTS, HINTS-GEM, and GEM. To this end, the branch has prioritized four tasks/products related to HINTS, HINTS-GEM, and GEM activities. HCIRB seeks to promote measure standardization and data harmonization through use of GEM; to encourage local data collections through use of the HINTS 4 instruments; use the results of GEM and HINTS-GEM activities to strategically plan national communication about cancer prevention and control; and disseminate the results of these efforts to the extramural research community.</p>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) possesses specific expertise in measure standardization and data harmonization. Pitt has been a Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) research site since 2004, and the NIH PROMIS initiative is closely tied to the Grid-Enabled Measures (GEM) portal. The Pitt Center for Clinical and Translational Informatics is currently developing translational research informatics tools for the NCI Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid Initiative (caBIG), one of NCI's first major data harmonization initiatives. Pitt's expertise in measure standardization and data harmonization is not readily available within the research community. Additionally, Pitt is uniquely positioned to carry out the tasks of this project. Pitt personnel have worked on the redesign of the HINTS website; conducted multiple HINTS analyses that resulted in several peer-reviewed manuscripts and conference presentations at national and international conferences; worked closely with HINTS leadership to develop content and a sampling plan for the most recent iteration of HINTS (HINTS 2007); and assisted in several HINTS dissemination activities.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, to procure interviewing, data processing and administrative support for a Clinical Project "Type 2 Diabetes and Social Networks".<br /><br />The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's largest medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The Social Network Methods Section (SNMS) of the Social and Behavioral Research Branch of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) is dedicated to examining the role of social relationships on health outcomes through the development and testing of social network-based health interventions, particularly in the context of families with inherited diseases. Contracting with Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center to complete these tasks is necessary since the sample for this project is based in the community settings in Cincinnati, OH. Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center will work with the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Cincinnati to recruit study participants. The collaborators in the Department of Family Medicine have previously recruited patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) to participate in a T2D pharmacogenomics study. The current study will expand upon the Section's research involving common disease risk among Mexican American families, and families affected by Lynch Syndrome. In order to more fully develop the SNMS research portfolio and address critical gaps in medical and public health research, contracting with Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center will be integral. The Contractor will collect social network data for the research project entitled "Type 2 diabetes and social networks." The current project aims to 1) evaluate social network systems related to dissemination of T2D within families at risk of T2D based on family health history (FHH), and 2) examine family members' perceptions of the importance of sharing FHH risk information with one another and factors influencing with whom they share information. Because of this contractor's familiarity with NHGRI and the study, it would be detriment and costly to have any other source receive this contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance is for 12 months.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide the following support on the project:</p>
<p>&bull; Administer the assessment surveys to study participants (online and telephone interviews);<br />&bull; Recruitment of the participants;<br />&bull; Serve as a point contact for participants throughout the project;&nbsp;and&nbsp;<br />&bull; Enter data into electronic database and conduct quality control.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 622110, General Medical and Surgical Hospitals with size standard in dollars $34.5M Per Annum. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-52 (May 31, 2011).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by June 22, 2011, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory is interested in receiving innovative proposals that offer potential for advancement and improvement in the technical topic areas listed. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.302(d) that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. Awards under this BAA are expected to take the form of contracts. Grants, cooperative agreements, other transactions may also be awarded if appropriate. NRL encourages Educational Institutions, Small Businesses (SBs), Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns (SDBs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) to submit proposals under this BAA. In order to conserve valuable offeror and Government resources, prospective offerors shall first submit a White Paper (WP), to include in a separate volume,&nbsp;a rough cost estimate to <a href="mailto:nrlproposals@nrl.navy.mil">nrlproposals@nrl.navy.mil</a>. <br /><br />Prospective offerors are encouraged to submit White Papers as early in the fiscal year as possible to maximize the potential for award. The selection of proposals for award will be based on a scientific review of proposals submitted in response to each BAA topic. The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the technical approach of each proposal. Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation. Selection of proposals for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of funds. <br /><br />The complete BAA including proposal preparation instructions, award considerations, and evaluation criteria is available at <a href="http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/baa/index02.htm">http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/baa/index02.htm</a>.<br /><br />Specific research topics of interest include:<br />

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SOLNBR>12-233-SOL-00002
<CONTACT>James J. Horkan, Phone 3014431658, Email james.horkan@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>The proposed acquisition listed herein is a total small business set-aside. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of the Administration for Native Americans (ANA) within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) of HHS for training and technical assistance (TTA) services for region 1 (Eastern). The RFP number is 12-233-SOL-00002. The NAICS code is 541618. The size standard is $7.0M.
<p><br />ANA promotes self-sufficiency for Native Americans by providing funding and training and technical assistance to eligible tribes and native organizations to develop, implement, and administer their own community-based projects. The concept of promoting self-sufficiency is based on the following core beliefs:</p>
<p>&bull; The native community is self-sufficient when it can generate and control the resources necessary to meets its social and economic goals and the needs of its members.<br />&bull; The responsibility for achieving self-sufficiency resides within the native governing bodies and local leadership.<br />&bull; Progress toward self-sufficiency is based on efforts to plan and direct resources in a comprehensive manner consistent with long-range goals.</p>
<p>Section 803 of the Native American Programs Act (NAPA) of 1974, P.L. 93-644, as amended (hereinafter "the Act"), identifies the programs that ANA funds while Section 804 authorizes training and technical assistance to potential applicants and grantees. Other supporting statutes are the Native American Languages Act (Public Law 102-524) and the Indian Environmental Regulatory Enhancement Act (Public Law 101-408).</p>
<p>In carrying out Section 803 of the Act, ANA administers the following competitive, discretionary project grant programs: (1) Social and Economic Development Strategies (SEDS); (2) Environmental Regulatory Enhancement; and (3) Native Language Preservation and Maintenance. The demand is highest for ANA grants in the SEDS program.</p>
<p>In response to Section 804 of the Act, ANA specifically provides training and technical assistance; coordinates annual panel review sessions; conducts annual project impact evaluations on its grantees; and directly administers community-based projects and several private-public partnerships. Typically, ANA administers approximately 240 projects a year. ANA's constituency resides in reservation, village, island and urban communities.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, ANA has streamlined, standardized, and automated many of its TTA processes and services. These modifications have allowed ANA to substantially reduce TTA costs and enhance the effectiveness and quality of ANA-funded community projects. As a result, ANA has demonstrated that close partnerships with TTA providers lead to the development and funding of effective and creative community projects that make a difference in the lives of Native American children, families, and communities.</p>
<p>ANA has organized its delivery of TTA services into four regions. Each region offers standardized services, as well as community and cultural resources specific to the communities located within its geographic region. The proposed acquisition is for the Region 1 (Eastern) which includes the following:</p>
<p>Region I: Eastern<br />Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Washington, DC, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, Minneapolis, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Vermont, Wisconsin, West Virginia</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to provide training and technical assistance in a broad range of areas. The TTA providers must be knowledgeable about ANA's mission, goals, and funding priorities, as well as HHS and ACF initiatives and issues of importance to organizations and entities eligible for ANA funding. The Contractor must have community-level project management experience and an understanding of the federal grant management and administration processes and associated OMB and HHS policies, regulations, and statutes. The Contractor must also possess a demonstrated expertise in Native American issues and challenges.</p>
<p>The period of performance is anticipated to be a 12 month base period followed by 4 optional 12 month periods.</p>
<p>The RFP will be made available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov no sooner than 15 days after the issuance of this notice. All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. The closing date will be approximately 30 days after issuance of the RFP.</p>

The RFP number is 12-233-SOL-00003. The NAICS code is 541618. The size standard is $7.0M.
<p><br />ANA promotes self-sufficiency for Native Americans by providing funding and training and technical assistance to eligible tribes and native organizations to develop, implement, and administer their own community-based projects. The concept of promoting self-sufficiency is based on the following core beliefs:</p>
<p>&bull; The native community is self-sufficient when it can generate and control the resources necessary to meets its social and economic goals and the needs of its members.<br />&bull; The responsibility for achieving self-sufficiency resides within the native governing bodies and local leadership.<br />&bull; Progress toward self-sufficiency is based on efforts to plan and direct resources in a comprehensive manner consistent with long-range goals.</p>
<p>Section 803 of the Native American Programs Act (NAPA) of 1974, P.L. 93-644, as amended (hereinafter "the Act"), identifies the programs that ANA funds while Section 804 authorizes training and technical assistance to potential applicants and grantees. Other supporting statutes are the Native American Languages Act (Public Law 102-524) and the Indian Environmental Regulatory Enhancement Act (Public Law 101-408).</p>
<p>In carrying out Section 803 of the Act, ANA administers the following competitive, discretionary project grant programs: (1) Social and Economic Development Strategies (SEDS); (2) Environmental Regulatory Enhancement; and (3) Native Language Preservation and Maintenance. The demand is highest for ANA grants in the SEDS program.</p>
<p>In response to Section 804 of the Act, ANA specifically provides training and technical assistance; coordinates annual panel review sessions; conducts annual project impact evaluations on its grantees; and directly administers community-based projects and several private-public partnerships. Typically, ANA administers approximately 240 projects a year. ANA's constituency resides in reservation, village, island and urban communities.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, ANA has streamlined, standardized, and automated many of its TTA processes and services. These modifications have allowed ANA to substantially reduce TTA costs and enhance the effectiveness and quality of ANA-funded community projects. As a result, ANA has demonstrated that close partnerships with TTA providers lead to the development and funding of effective and creative community projects that make a difference in the lives of Native American children, families, and communities.</p>
<p>ANA has organized its delivery of TTA services into four regions. Each region offers standardized services, as well as community and cultural resources specific to the communities located within its geographic region. The proposed acquisition is for the Region 2 (Western) which includes the following:</p>
<p>Region 2: Western<br />Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to provide training and technical assistance in a broad range of areas. The TTA providers must be knowledgeable about ANA's mission, goals, and funding priorities, as well as HHS and ACF initiatives and issues of importance to organizations and entities eligible for ANA funding. The Contractor must have community-level project management experience and an understanding of the federal grant management and administration processes and associated OMB and HHS policies, regulations, and statutes. The Contractor must also possess a demonstrated expertise in Native American issues and challenges.</p>
<p>The period of performance is anticipated to be a 12 month base period followed by 4 optional 12 month periods.</p>
<p>The RFP will be made available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov no sooner than 15 days after the issuance of this notice. All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. The closing date will be approximately 30 days after issuance of the RFP.</p>

<DESC>The proposed acquisition listed herein is unrestricted. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of the Office of Child Care (OCC) within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) for a National Center on Child Care Subsidy Innovation and Accountability, as described below. The RFP number is 11-233-SOL-00260. The NAICS code is 541611.
<p><br />The OCC supports low-income working families&nbsp;through child care financial assistance and promotes children's learning by improving the quality of early care and education and after-school programs. The OCC is responsible for administering the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) - a program that helps low-income families access child care for children while parents work or participate in education or training. A portion of CCDF also is used to improve the quality of child care. In FY 2010, the OCC awarded $5 billion in CCDF funds to States, Territories, and Indian Tribes through block grants. States and Territories invest $1 billion each year in quality improvements.<br /><br />Each State, Territory and Tribe appoints a Lead Agency to administer the CCDF funds. These Lead Agencies make decisions about CCDF priorities, policies, and expenditures, including: determining eligibility requirements, setting family co-payment levels, establishing provider payment rates, setting target populations, and prioritizing quality investments. States, Territories and Tribes are required to complete a comprehensive planning process every two years, and to provide information on child care policies to ACF in biennial CCDF Plans.</p>
<p>OCC recognizes that efficient, well run programs enhance access to services for eligible families and children and create a key link in the education of young children and the self sufficiency of families. The National Center on Child Care Subsidy Innovation and Accountability will provide technical support that combines strong policies that support access, quality, and accountability into a holistic framework. Subsidy administration encompasses a wide range of activities that may include, but is not limited to, program management and governance, strategic planning, policy review and development, community partnerships and business practices. Program integrity involves the strengthening of accountability while continuing to preserve access for eligible children and families. The center will coordinate activities that combine subsidy administration and program integrity through coordinated technical assistance activities. The intersection of these two areas will help ensure that child care subsidy programs are being managed in an efficient and effective manner and that limited program dollars are leveraged to benefit the low-income eligible families for which assistance is intended.</p>
<p>OCC has established a Child Care Technical Assistance Network (CCTAN) to support the work of States, Territories, and Tribes that administer the CCDF. In the years 2007-2011, CCTAN projects included: After-School Investments; the Center on the Social and Emotional Foundations for Early Learning; Child Care Aware; Child Care and Early Education Research Connections; the Child Care Information System Technical Assistance Project; the Communications Management Center; Healthy Child Care America; the National Child Care Information and Technical Assistance Center; the National Infant and Toddler Child Care Initiative; the Tribal Child Care Technical Assistance Center, and the Child Care Improper Payments Initiative.</p>
<p>In FY 2011, OCC will reorganize its CCTAN to specialize its technical assistance (TA) in core areas, including the following new projects: the National Center on Child Care Quality Improvement; the National Center on Child Care Professional Development Systems and Workforce Initiatives; the National Center on Child Care Subsidy Innovation and Accountability; and the State Child Care Systems Specialist Network.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this contract is expected to be a base year plus four option years. The purpose of this contract is to create an integrated technical assistance framework that provides valuable support to Lead Agencies in their efforts to: <br />&nbsp; - Develop and maintain a strong subsidy administration that promotes policies and implementation strategies that are child-focused, family-friendly, and that work in partnership with child care providers; and <br /><br />&nbsp; - Increase accountability and integrity of programs to ensure that program dollars are utilized appropriately and efficiently to promote high-quality services and best serve the low-income eligible families for which assistance is intended.</p>
<p>While the specific topics for new technical assistance will evolve based on current needs, input from stakeholders and the CCDF Plans and goal setting, OCC's objective is for the technical assistance, consultation, training and materials under this contract to help States and Territories work toward four core goals:</p>
<p>1) A higher proportion of low income children, in particular children who receive child care subsidies, served in higher quality care.<br />2) Increased stability and continuity of subsidy receipt and quality child care arrangements to promote families' financial security and children's development. <br />3) An adequate and stable supply of high quality providers.<br />4) Strong program integrity in the context of CCDF.</p>
<p>The RFP will be made available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov no sooner than 15 days after the issuance of this notice. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. The closing date will be approximately 40 days after issuance of the RFP.</p>

<SUBJECT>E-Consent Trial: Education, Collection, & Evaluation of Patient Choice 
<SOLNBR>11-233-SOL-00256

<CONTACT>Anthony Foster, Phone 301-443-3415, Fax 301-443-2761, Email anthony.foster@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC><p><br />The Office of the Chief Privacy Officer (OCPO) within the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), through the Departmentof Health and Human Services, Division of Acquisition Management, Strategic Acquisition Service, Program Support Center (PSC), will be issuing a solicitation for the education, collection, and evaluation of patient choice in the electronic exchange of health information.</p>
<p>One of the key goals of the Federal Health Information Technology Strategic Plan is to inspire consumer trust and confidence in health information technology and electronic health information exchange. Informed patient choice is one way to ensure a trust relationship with patients for the success of electronic health information exchange. Recent recommendations by the Health Information Technology Policy Committee (HITPC) stress the importance of meaningful consent, noting that the person who has the treating relationship with the patient is responsible for educating patients regarding how information will be shared and with whom, as well as obtaining and tracking patient consent. The recommendations further state that ONC should provide resources to providers related to enabling patients to make meaningful choices with respect to consent.</p>
<p>With the growing interest in electronic consent mechanisms, and considering the role of meaningful patient choice in the success of electronic health information exchange, it is important to look carefully at the issues surrounding electronic consent. Research to date on this topic is limited, and in particular, the educational component of electronic consent must be explored in more detail. It is critical to understand what information patients desire and need when making decisions regarding their personal health information as well as what information they consider relevant for patient choice regarding the exchange of their health information in an electronic environment. In addition, it is essential to understand issues related to presenting educational material to patients about the realities associated with the electronic exchange of health information and patient choice with respect to sharing their health information. It will be important to address the unique challenges of collecting and tracking patient choice regarding sharing their health information in an electronic environment, where information exchanged between health care providers must indicate a patient's meaningful, informed choice and enable the patient choice to be honored.</p>
<p>The Contractor selected will use innovative ways to educate and inform individuals of their option to exercise individual choice in a clinical setting regarding the electronic exchange of their health information; and ensure that individuals are knowledgeable participants in decisions about the sharing their electronic health information in a clinical environment as well as explore and evaluate ways of electronically obtaining and recording meaningful, informed choice from individuals in a clinical setting, regarding the electronic exchange of their health information.</p>
<p>The anticipated contract period of performance will be for a 12-month base period plus one 12-month option period. It is anticiapted that the solicitation will be issued approximately 15 days after this synopsis notice is issued and will be made available electronically at this address: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Only electronic copies of the solicitation will be available. Proposals will be due approximately 30 days after the date the solicitation is issued. Competition will be restricted to small business concerns only, under NAICS Code 554990 during the period of July 6, 2011 through August 5, 2011</p>

<DESC>Scope:
<p>Under the James Zadroga 9/11 Health Compensation Act of 2010 (Pub.L.111-347), hereinafter referred to the World Trade Center (WTC) Act, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has been authorized to establish Clinical Centers of Excellence (CCEs) to provide health care for first responders to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The WTC Act requires the CDC to pay claims associated with medical treatment for first responders for a period of five years. The WTC Act also requires that an OPDIV other than CDC process the payments for these services; the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has established an interagency agreement with CDC to pay these claims and is seeking a WTC Payment Contractor to effectuate that arrangement. CMS intends to award a four year contract beginning 3/15/12 to a WTC Payment Contractor in order to provide payments to providers for medical services for first responders in accordance with the WTC Act.</p>
<p>Due to the urgent and compelling need to begin making payments by July 2011, CMS awarded a one year Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) contract to a WTC Payment Contractor 5/5/11. CMS is now seeking sources capable of issuing payments to WTC providers beginning May 2012 using an established, tested and approved payment system that complies with CMS IT security and architecture requirements. The WTC Payment Contractor must have established Gentran connectivity with the CMS data center to exchange EFT and check files with the Medicare bank (US Bank) used for this project. The WTC Payment Contractor must have an established point of presence on the CMSnet in order to exchange payment files with the CDC designated contractor using Connect.Direct. The WTC Payment Contractor must also be FISMA and 508 compliant and meet all the security compliance and financial management and liability requirements that are identified in the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) contracts at the time of award.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>

<DESC>FEDBIZOPPS ANNOUNCEMENT SOURCES SOUGHT - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<p>As prescribed in FAR 15.209(c), the following provision is inserted: IAW FAR 52.215-3 --Request for Information (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of identifying information on Repeater Site Monitor (RSM) systems that have already been developed or may be modified from other commercial industry solutions to meet the agency requirement as listed below:</p>
<p>The Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, is seeking sources interested in providing the component level hardware for a Repeater Site Monitor (RSM) system. The RSM Program will support the measurement and recording of signal parameters relating to radio repeaters and operating conditions inside the repeater enclosure. The recorded data are periodically retrieved and stored in a central data base that can be accessed through a web-based reporting system. <br /><br />The system is planned for operation in shielded communication shelters, walk-in communication shelters, observational look-out posts, and communication closets. Forest Service personnel with access to the Forest Service Intranet may view a web enabled utility that monitors trend data on operating and environmental parameters and determine if service is warranted at specific sites.</p>
<p>Ethernet capability is not available at all intended sites; the RSM device should be capable of communicating through an RS232 serial port as an alternative to the Ethernet port in the event that a serial data modem is required as part of the communications link.</p>
<p><br />REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />Responses to this RFI are to include suggestions on design approaches with regards to the following specifications:</p>
<p>I. Continuous and Triggered Measurements<br />a) Several parameters require monitoring regardless of repeater activity. DC battery voltages, AC source voltages, enclosure temperature, and entry door status are parameters that should be checked frequently, although measurements may be binned hourly.<br />b) External voltage dividers or converters may be employed to convert the measured voltage levels into signals compatible with the RSM inputs. For turnkey systems, the voltage dividers should be transparent to the installer; that is, the installer should not have to construct an external circuit to comply with the input voltage limitations of the data logger.<br />c) Parameters associated with repeater activity need only to be measured when a repeater is active. Transmitter RF output power and reflected RF power from the antenna or duplexer should be monitored during transmissions; the push-to-talk signal (PTT) from the transmitter is the trigger for RF power measurements. On the receiver side, the carrier-operated relay (COR) signal from the receiver is the trigger for measuring the relative signal strength indicator (RSSI) output of the receiver.<br />d) Several parameters need to be measured repeatedly when the transmitter is active. Battery voltage is likely to sag during transmissions, and transmitter output power may vary as the power amplifier warms up. During an active PTT interval, maximum and minimum values should be recorded for battery voltage, forward RF power, and reflected RF power.<br />e) A desirable logging feature would be to record how many minutes in each hour have repeater activity.<br />f) Whereas routine data need only be reported daily and will be subject to polling from a server, out-of-tolerance conditions should initiate immediate data broadcasts to the server. Typical alarm conditions are open door, low enclosure temperature (near or below freezing), low battery voltage, or high reflected power.</p>
<p>II. Standard and Expanded Versions<br />The standard RSM should be capable of monitoring three repeaters and/or base stations. In addition, it should have inputs for monitoring at least four system voltages, enclosure temperature, and the status of the entry door. This collection of monitored parameters adds up to the following:<br />a) At least 7 digital inputs (door, 3 PTT inputs, 3 COR inputs);<br />b) At least 14 analog inputs (temperature in Fahrenheit, 6 RF power sensor levels, 3 RSSI inputs, 4 system voltage scalars).<br />c) Expansion options should be available for monitor 1-2 additional repeaters. This amounts to 2 digital inputs and 3 analog inputs per repeater/base station.</p>
<p>III. Probable specs list<br />a) 16 analog inputs (minimum count), 12 bit resolution or greater, +/- 5V range (minimum), sampling time &lt; 1mS. Analog inputs may be used for monitoring system voltages, temperature, outputs of RF power sensors, fuel level for backup power source.<br />b) RF power monitoring: directional RF watt meters should be capable of monitoring up to 100W of transmitter output power and 10W of reflected power from the antenna or combiner with less than 5% error. Accuracy should be specified for operation between 160-173MHz. The reflected power sensor should be capable of tolerating power levels of 50W for 5 minutes.<br />c) DC voltage monitoring: built-in voltage dividers provide scaling for full-scale voltages of<br />1) +/- 25V<br />2) +/- 50V<br />3) +/- 100V<br />d) 8 digital inputs (minimum count), voltage threshold near 2.0V, ability to withstand 15V inputs.<br />e) Active pull-ups available on PTT and open door sensor inputs.<br />f) Ethernet and serial (RS232) communications options.<br />g) At least 500 kB data memory.<br />h) 12V system operating voltage +4/-2V; 20 mA nominal operating current when not communicating.<br />i) Door Position Sensor: accepts normally-closed switch, such as a magnetic reed switch.<br />j) Environmental Considerations: Hardware will be capable of withstanding temperatures from -<br />-30&deg; to +60&deg; C</p>
<p>IV. Preferred mechanical configuration<br />a) 2U chassis for mounting in 19 inch relay rack. Final product may contain multiple 2U chassis.</p>
<p>V. Preferred RF connectors<br />a) N female.</p>
<p>VI. Preferred connection for power and signals <br />a) Rear panel terminal block.</p>
<p>VII. Communications and Database Software<br />a) The data logger must contain communications features that permit downloading data to a database and allows the logging program to be modified remotely. Client software must permit immediate connections to RSM and scheduled data downloads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />RESPONSES</p>

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled , veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541511 with a small business size standard of $25 million.<br />This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research.<br /><br />Background<br />The primary mission of TEHIP is to provide core information resources and services, facilitate access to national and international information resources, and strengthen the infrastructure for toxicology and health information. In support of this mission, the Program makes available on the web a suite of databases containing both factual and bibliographic information on environmental and health topics.<br /><br />The advent of the web technology made it possible for TEHIP to extend the reach of its existing databases by hyperlinking to other health information resources in and outside of the government. Moreover, the web technology helped to make its information resources easily available not only to its traditional users such as toxicologists, industrial hygienists, healthcare providers, and regulatory specialists, but also to the public at large seeking information about health effects.
<p>The unprecedented consumer interest in nutrition, the limited governmental oversight and regulation of the supplement industry and the potential impacts of supplement use on health care costs have caused government and academic scientists to examine closely the patterns of supplement use and their health consequences. Through surveys, researchers attempt to draw conclusions regarding the nutritional status of populations and the significance of supplement intake in relation to total diet or disease risk. One hurdle researchers face is lack of complete knowledge of ingredients in supplement brands used by consumers.</p>
<p>Objectives<br />The purpose of this procurement is to acquire updates to existing product data and new product data for the NLM Dietary Supplements Labels Database. <br /><br />Project Requirements <br />For each of approximately 1,000 dietary supplement products the following types of information shall be provided.</p>
<p>&bull; Brand name, Form, Active and Inactive Ingredients, Amount of Active Ingredient/unit, Suggested dose, Health claims, Warnings, Percentage Daily Value provided by the suggested dose, FDA warning, Universal product code (UPC) and any other product information located on the label <br />&bull; Manufacturer/Distributor Name, Address, Website and Customer Information Telephone Number from Product Label, and Name, Address, and Telephone Number of Parent Company (from label or literature sources)<br />&bull; Fact Sheets on supplements, when available from Federal Government sources<br />&bull; CAS registry numbers, when available, for active ingredients<br />&bull; Supplement Categories<br />&#61485; Vitamins<br />&#61485; Minerals<br />&#61485; Botanicals<br />&#61485; Amino Acids<br />&#61485; Weight Loss/Gain<br />&#61485; Specialty</p>
<p>Approximately half of the product information would be for new products that currently do not exist in the NLM Dietary Supplements Labels Database. The other half of the data would be updated information for existing products within the database. Note, the government would not provide any existing data to build from since it is copyrighted. The awardee would be required to collect /obtain data for existing products independently.<br /><br />Anticipated Period of Performance<br />The Project Start (PS) date shall be within 10 days after award. The period of performance shall be 12 months from effective date with the option to extend the period of performance for 3 additional 12 month periods. Inclusion of options does not commit the Government to exercise the options. <br /><br />Other Important Considerations<br />The proposed acquisition will be procured in accordance with the policies and procedures under FAR 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine. This Sources Sought Notice is not a Request for Quotes (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.<br />Interested firms responding to this Sources Sought Notice must adhere to the following:</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK


BACKGROUND 
Patients with Parkinson's disease often have poor speech intelligibility that affects their everyday communication. The VA RR&D recently awarded a grant to develop appropriate tools for the quantification of speech intelligibility in these patients. This 4-year study (2009-2013) will conduct a series of experiments to better understand the speech intelligibility deficits in these patients and the present contract is related to this overall objective. This contract is being funded by the grant entitled "Measurement of Dysarthric Intelligibility Using Speech Recognition." 

OBJECTIVE
The overall objective of this contract is to acquire professional services to assist in the execution of research studies on speech intelligibility in patients with Parkinson's disease. The primary job responsibilities will be to develop, implement and test suitable digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms to quantify speech intelligibility in patients with Parkinson's disease. 

DEFINITIONS 
DSP - Digital signal processing

PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS
The contractor to perform the specifications outlined in this contract. The contractor's representatives will each have minimum qualifications of: 
Ph.D. or Master's degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering. Students enrolled in Ph.D. program in ECE may also be considered for this position. Candidates must have good working knowledge and experience in DSP algorithms especially that related to speech analyses, coding and compression. 

SCOPE OF WORK
The contractor's representative will assist the VA researcher and other members of the VA research team by:
The candidates will:
1. Analyze large databases of normal and disordered speech (from patients with Parkinson's disease) to identify salient acoustic characteristics that differentiate the patient samples from normal speech. 
2. Identify and implement suitable algorithms for speech analyses especially those related to the assessment of speech intelligibility. 
3. Test these algorithms to determine whether these predict speech intelligibility in patients with Parkinson's disease with suitable sensitivity and specificity.
4. Suitably modify existing algorithms or develop new algorithms for the assessment of speech intelligibility in patients with Parkinson's disease.
5. Provide assistance with any other procedures required for the success of the research study.
The candidates will be required to attend weekly research meeting with the Principal Investigator. In addition, the candidates will need to maintain regular contact with the Principal Investigator via e-mail, telephone or through personal meetings to ensure continuous progress on the research. 

DATA/DELIVERABLES 
The deliverables will consist of initial Matlab-based software that will automatically categorize the intelligibility of disordered speech, preliminary results on existing data set and a report describing the contributions.
Deliverable Reporting Summary: at the end of the contract a minimum of two algorithms will be produced based on the assessment of speech intelligibility throughout the year. A summary and confirmation of these algorithms will be provided to the principal investigator on the grant and the principal investigator will verify it's completion to the contracting officer's representative (COR). The COR may at anytime ask for an update or progress report from the contractors.

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION: INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR "ADVANCED AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGIES FOR BLAST AND FRAGMENTATION EFFECTS MITIGATION FOR INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENTS." This is an announcement that the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) intends to award a Sole Source contract. The AFRL, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Airbase Technology Division (AFRL/RXQ) is contemplating the award of a contract to the National Institute of Building Sciences, 1090 Vermont Ave NW, Ste 700, Washington, DC 20005 for the program entitled "Advanced and Applied Technologies for Blast and Fragmentation Effects Mitigation for Infrastructure Components" under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5) as implemented by FAR 6.302-5, "Authorized or Required by Statute." The National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) was established by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Public Law 93-383, as currently codified at 12 U.S.C. 1701j-2. Section 809(g)(3) of the statute states: "Every department, agency, and establishment of the Federal Government having responsibility for building or construction, or for building- or construction-related programs, is authorized and encouraged to request authorization and appropriations for grants to the Institute for its general support, and is authorized to contract with and accept contracts from the Institute for specific services where deemed appropriate by the responsible Federal official involved." This effort will facilitate the agile acquisition and application of technical capability and expertise necessary to perform research, development, test, evaluation, modeling, analysis and prototyping of various protection technologies in support of protection against blast and fragmentation susceptibility of forward operating base infrastructure. AFRL intends to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) task orders to the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) under the authority cited above to obtain this capability. Task orders may be issued under this contract in the following areas: <br />1. Research and Development Scientific Technical Expertise: Provide scientific and technical expertise in multiple disciplines to provide infrastructure modeling design, blast effects modeling, blast testing data evaluation and new technology deployment best practices recommendations. Necessary capabilities include access to mature modeling software in these areas as well as resources to provide pertinent analysis, evaluation, recommendations and reporting. <br />2. Design-to-Prototype Realization Capability: The ability to implement physical prototypes of various infrastructure components suitable for blast and fragmentation testing is necessary to test efficacy of new technologies. Accordingly, the ability to fabricate prototypes to design specifications at various test ranges is necessary. Necessary capabilities include, but are not limited to, requisite construction engineering experience, extensive knowledge and experience in the myriad construction technologies and methodologies, requisite prototype construction capability in various materials, site construction processes, test site preparation, test instrumentation and measurement capability, post-testing analysis and post-test site clean-up and debris removal. <br />3. Technology Transfer Expertise: Successful deployment of newly developed blast and fragmentation technologies requires knowledge and understanding of the processes and methods required to insert new technology into existing and new construction infrastructure. Expertise in the challenges faced concerning retrofitting existing infrastructure, cost-benefit issues associated with new technology insertion, expert knowledge of construction best practices and current and state-of-the-art construction methodologies and their benefits and shortfalls is particularly necessary. Expertise and capability must be highly experienced and qualified in all aspects of insertion of new construction technology and methodology into existing and new proposed infrastructure with optimal cost, schedule, and performance as the primary goals. <br />4. Expertise and Research Capability Identification and Acquisition: Given the complex nature of research and development into these mitigation technologies, the ability to provide pertinent expertise and capability to perform the necessary R&amp;D is critical. The ability to locate and broker R&amp;D expertise and capability as well as the ability to bring this expertise to bear in a timely and efficient manner is crucial to these types of efforts. The ability to broker work agreements, develop multiple relationships between various R&amp;D partners, and obtain these resources in a timely and cost effective manner is crucial. <br />It is estimated that the planned sole source IDIQ contract will be awarded with a total contract ceiling price of $5,000,000. The period of performance for this procurement is anticipated to be 84 months. Vendors who are capable of providing the services stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above not later than 3:00 PM, Eastern Daylight Time, on the fifteenth day after publication of this synopsis. Responses must be submitted to Scott Savory, Contracting Officer, via email at Scott.Savory@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>Introduction: Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army<br>RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of PM-SCIE, intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole<br>source basis to: TEXTILE PROTECTION AND COMFORT CENTER (T-PACC), 2401 Research Drive, Raleigh NC, 27695.  <br><br>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.<br><br>RESPONSES WILL BE RECEIVED FOR FUTURE REQUIREMENT CONSIDERATION ONLY.<br><br>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.<br><br>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the<br>agency's needs:<br>The objective of this effort is to compare the results of burn predictions from two exposure durations for several differing garment types in order to establish correlation between two testing falcilities. Results will derive from exposures conducted at both the Natick Thermal Test Facility (TTF) and at the Textile<br>Protection and Comfort Center (T-PACC) PyroMan test facility located at North Carolina State University(NC State.) Proprietary business confidential flux data and burn predictions from these exposures will be exchanged for collaborative analysis. In addition, analysis using the current burn model, calculations<br>including the emerging ASTMF 1930 burn standard, will be conducted.<br><br>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to<br>provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights,<br>etc.):<br>Until the recent opening of the Natick TTF, an ASTM F 1930 thermal manikin burn tests for Product Manager, Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM SCIE) were conducted at the Textile Protection and Comfort Center (T-PACC) at NC State. With the development of the new ASTM F 1930 flash-fire manikin at the Natick Soldier Center (NSC) thermal test facility (TTF), there are a number of opportunities<br>for T-PACC to collaborate with Natick personnel to enhance the quality of thermal manikin testing at both falcilities. This proposal for research collaboration will advance the understanding of the comparisons and differences between the thermal response of the two systems and the corresponding burn predictions.<br><br>This effort will allow PM SCIE to correlate future burns of clothing and individual equipment conducted at the Natick TTF to the burns conducted in the past at T-PACC. This correlation and testing effort will be lead by a team of scientists at the T-PACC who possess extensive education and experience in conducting tests for the military utilizing whole ensemb1e fue exposure testing. These scientists include: Professor Roger Barker, Director of the Textile Protection and Comfort Center and Burlington Professor of Textile Technology at NC State and Mr. Anthony Shawn Deaton, Special Projects Director of the T-PACC. Professor Barker has conducted testing and researeh of thermally protective textiles for over twenty years and is internationally recognized as an expert in this. field. Mr. Deaton has been involved in testing and research on thermally protective garments for over seven years and is an active member of the American Standard Testing Materials (ASTM) subcommittee that is updating the Fl930 standard as well as creating a<br>new Stored Energy Test standard.<br><br>It is unreasonable to expect another vendor to be able to assimilate the variables of this complex service and provide PM SCIE with the same level of services and appropriate skill mix of contractor experience and staffing in the short term required for this effort. Any new contractor would need adequate time to<br>build a facility, purchase and calibrate their equipment and adjust and familiarize themselves with the military's processes and policies. PM SCIE considers a minimum four to five year transitional period is required to provide similar or superior quality testing to support the Army's requirements.<br><br>Another competition in lieu of a sole source award to NC State would result in a costly duplication of effort estimated to be $500K without any benefit to the Government to re-due all testing to date. Additional resources would be expended to conduct a competition, to include soliciting and evaluating competing proposals and selecting the successful offeror, and as previously stated a four to five year transition period would be required to enable a new contractor to develop the ability to perform at an acceptable level required. Also, assuming there were other vendors capable of competing for an effort, a competition would take approximately six months.<br><br>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or<br>a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<br><br>Knowledgeable individuals within the Government and Industry were contacted to ascertain market capabilities to meet the requirements of this effort. PM SCIE determined that there are only two faleilities,the T -PACC at NC State and the DuPont Corporation. The DuPont facility does not contract for test and<br>evaluation of materials outside of their own product lines. Additionally, the PyroHand is a unique instrumented manikin, developed by NC State, TP & CC, under Government contract for NSRDEC.<br><br>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<br>As explained above, competition for the subject interim work is not possible.<br><br>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or<br>overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for<br>the supplies or services required:<br>Competition of this effort is not contemplated after the correlation of the two test facilities is completed. PM SCIE will conduct all future thermal testing at the Government owned Natick TTF.<br><br>6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this<br>requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick<br>Contracting Division via e-mail to: gregory.d.schroeder@us.army.mil no later<br>than COB 22 June 2011.<br>Contracting Office Address:<br>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<br>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<br>Kansas Street, Building 1<br>Natick, MA 01760-5011

<DESC><strong>RFI Purpose:<br /></strong>The Department of Education is issuing this request for information (RFI) in an effort to conduct market research for potential sources that may have the technical capability to meet its requirements to upgrade the Office of Inspector General's Education Investigations Tracking System. The goal of the RFI is to ascertain the level of interest and availability of potential vendors seeking to provide Computer System Design Services and obtain additional information regarding Computer System Design Services options and best practices.
<p>Important Note:<br />This is a request for information (RFI) only. This RFI is issued as market research, solely for information and planning purposes. It shall not be considered as an invitation for bid (IFB), request for quotation (RFQ), request for proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the government to acquire any products or services. Any response to this RFI is purely voluntary and will be treated as information only. The government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred. The information provided may be used by the Department of Education in developing its acquisition strategy and the related statement of work, statement of objectives or performance specifications. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued</p>
<p><strong>Background: <br /></strong>The ED-OIG implemented EDITS in February 2005. EDITS is a web-based information system that replaced the former case management system known as Investigative Case Tracking System. EDITS was instituted to ensure ED-OIG investigative data collected during investigations is stored for the effective retrieval, cross referencing and analysis by ED-OIG investigative personnel nationwide.</p>
<p>The implementation of EDITS has fulfilled ED-OIG's need to establish an accurate method to process investigative data, evidence, training records and other information essential to the agency's investigative mission in an orderly, systematic and accurate manner. ED-OIG investigative staff members such as special agents, desk officers, regional supervisors and headquarters support personnel utilize EDITS to input, cross reference, review, update, and track investigations and other investigations-related data within the agency. EDITS provides headquarters investigative management and regional supervisors with the ability to query the investigative data to establish investigative trends to make better informed decisions relative to investigative matters, resource allocations, training needs and the initiation of new investigative processes. Headquarters investigative management and regional supervisors use EDITS to evaluate ongoing cases/workplans, collect data to assist with performance evaluations, assemble investigative data and statistical accomplishments in preparation for the Semi-Annual Reports to Congress, for Congressional inquiries, and the annual report to the President. EDITS is a versatile and effective case management system that is required for ED-OIG to adhere to the Council of Inspectors General Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) quality standards for investigations, and to continue to maintain compliance with those standards. Failure to maintain these standards could have severe adverse consequences for an OIG, up to loss of statutory law enforcement authority.</p>
<p>The Department is currently considering an upgrade and enhancement to the U.S. Department of Education (ED), Office of Inspector General (OIG), Investigative Services Investigation Tracking System (EDITS). Upgrades to the system will incorporate advanced technologies, improve the underlying software architecture, meet the technical standards for Section 508 compliance at 36 CFR 1194.21 and 1194.22., and permit for expeditious future development of other modules or features throughout the upcoming years.</p>
<p>EDITS is a modified version of an existing Government Off The Shelf (GOTS) investigations case tracking program developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Office of Inspector General (NASA-OIG). The firm ED-OIG seeks to partner with will provide the necessary programming and documentation support for newly identified requirements for this GOTS application. This contract will be for programming and documentation tasks needed to further customize this GOTS application developed by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Office of Inspector General, by modifying the written codes of the software design to meet customer needs. <br /><br /><strong>Information Being Requested:<br /></strong>Responses to this RFI will help shape the government's strategy for upgrading EDITS, as well as any subsequent formalized requests for proposal. The information provided in response to this RFI should include the following:</p>
<p>1) Reasonable and fair market cost estimates of labor rates and identification of technical expertise required to perform work stipulated in the Statement of Work attached. The thrust of work performed will be to upgrade the U.S. Department of Education (ED), Office of Inspector General (OIG) Investigative Services Investigation Tracking System (EDITS). Upgrading and enhancement will incorporate advanced technologies, improve the underlying software architecture, meet the technical standards for Section 508 compliance at 36 CFR 1194.21 and 1194.22., and permit for future development and enhancements, expeditiously, going forward. <br />2) Technical expertise based on industry standards and demonstrated performance in programming with expert knowledge of computer, electronic and information technology. <br />3) Workable staffing approach including identification of staff and skill sets required to complete the project in one year or less.<br /><br /><strong>RFI Submission Requirements:<br /></strong>Proprietary information is not being solicited; however, if it is submitted, it should be appropriately marked. Please limit your formal submission to no more than 20 pages, to include cover letter and response. Electronic submissions are strongly encouraged. All items must be in Microsoft office 2000 or adobe pdf format and should be free of all computer viruses.</p>
<p>Technical questions and industry responses shall be submitted via email to: Tracie L. Hull at Tracie.Hull@ed.gov. Technical questions must be received no later than 4:00 pm eastern standard time on Thursday, June 23, 2011. RFI responses must be received no later than 4:00 pm eastern standard time on Thursday, June 30, 2011. All material submitted in response to this RFI must be unclassified and properly marked.</p>

<DESC>There is no solicitation.  The United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Contracting and General Services Division in Portland, OR has plans to award using other than full and open competition to Bigfoot Consulting of Sherwood Oregon.  Requirement involves work to finalize a Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP) for the Kaua'i National Wildlife Refuge Complex. Given contractor's past work in this area for this Refuge and knowledge of Service policies,  the government determines it to be in their best interest to conclude the requirement through this contractor as a substantial duplication of costs would otherwise be anticipated to bring another contractor on board.  The Service intends to award Sole Source to Bigfoot Consulting.  This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue award using other than full and open competition and is not a request for competitive proposals.  The determination of the Government not to open subject requirement to full and open competition was made IAW FAR 6.302-1.  Technical inquiries may be directed to Shannon Smith at (808) 828-1413.  Contracting inquiries may be directed to Karl Lautzenheiser at telephone number (503) 231-2052.  No further notice will be posted on Fedbizopps.

<CONTACT>Marc Manheimer, Email dni-iarpa-rfi-11-01@ugov.gov
<DESC>Synopsis<br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) often selects its research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process.  This request for information (RFI) is intended to provide information relevant to a possible future IARPA program, so that feedback from potential participants can be considered prior to the issuance of a BAA.  Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to adequately address the scientific and technical challenges described below. Additionally, responses to this request may be used to inform a one-day workshop (explained below). Therefore, responses to this RFI must be available for unrestricted public distribution, and hence proprietary material should not be included in responses.  The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.<br />Background <br />The goal is to develop memory technologies that will enable high performance computing systems with greatly improved energy efficiency.
<p>Computing systems based on single flux quantum (SFQ) logic are of interest for their potential to provide both lower energy per operation and higher speed relative to CMOS. SFQ logic is based on pulses generated by Josephson junctions with quantized flux &#61510;0 = 2.07 mV&#61655;ps. Pulses are typically of magnitude ~1 mV and duration ~1 ps. Variants of SFQ logic include: rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ), efficient single flux quantum (eSFQ) and reciprocal quantum logic (RQL).</p>
<p>In addition to logic, computing systems require memory and interconnects. An intermediate term goal is a 10-100 GHz, 32-bit, 1-million gate processor with at least 1 MiB of local memory integrated on a multi-chip module (MCM).</p>
<p>High performance computing systems need significant quantities of memory in close proximity to the logic circuits. Systems based on SFQ logic are currently hampered by the lack of compatible cache (on-chip) and main memory (on-chip or off-chip, but still physically close) of sufficiently low energy dissipation, high speed, and high density. Practical SFQ logic implementations currently require the use of low temperature superconductors in the Josephson junction switching elements and typically must operate at temperatures below 10 K. Memory is needed that can operate in the 4-10 K temperature range, preferably on the logic chips.</p>
<p>SFQ logic pulses are low voltage (~1 mV) and contain very little energy. Amplifying SFQ logic pulses to drive memories can require significant time, energy and circuitry. In general, the less amplification required, the more compatible the memory. Superconductive memories based on flux quanta are compatible with SFQ logic, but have not yet achieved sufficiently high area density.</p>
<p>The fabrication technology used to produce a memory affects compatibility with SFQ logic circuits. Fabrication technologies for SFQ logic currently are expected to have the following general characteristics:</p>
<p>&bull;	Technology Node: 250 to 90 nm<br />&bull;	superconducting material: Nb<br />&bull;	superconducting layers: 8-12 (most planarized)<br />&bull;	compatible with CMOS back-end-of-line fabrication processes in most cases<br />&bull;	Josephson junction critical current density: 10-50 kA/cm2, &lt; &#61617;5% spread (1 sigma)</p>
<p>Memory of different types may be needed to balance requirements for energy efficiency, speed, density, and cost. The memory hierarchy typically includes register, cache and main memory. Register memory is within the data path. Cache memory may be subdivided in a hierarchy such as Level 1 (L1) and Level 2 (L2) with L1 cache memory being the fastest. Memory directly on the CPU chip may include some or all of the cache memories.</p>
<p>Memory technologies suitable for use as cache or main memories are of interest. Candidates for cache or main memory elements should have read/write energies in the 10-17 to 10-19 joule range, with read/write times in the low nanosecond range or better. Main memories that operate above 4 K are also of interest, with relaxed energy requirements given the reduced cooling overhead. The initial memory density target is for 108 bits/cm2 with the expectation of an order of magnitude improvement over time or better. Access latency for memory that includes decoding and addressing should be ten clock cycles or less (@10 GHz clock).</p>
<p>The above numbers represent rough initial goals, and cryogenic memories will need to exceed these goals for eventual success of a program to develop superconducting computing. Information on memories that meet or exceed these goals is especially welcome.  Ideas for which these numbers have not been determined are nevertheless encouraged with the expectation that good estimates could be established within a year's time,  as are ideas that do not meet these goals initially but for which it is anticipated that a clear path to improvement, given a modest level of effort, is possible within a year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Scope</p>
<p>Information is requested about memory technologies compatible with SFQ logic chips. Memory that can be fabricated on the same chip and operable using the mV-level signals produced by SFQ Josephson junction logic circuits is preferred but is not required. Information requested here would, at a minimum, address the following questions:</p>
<p>&bull;	What is the physical basis of the memory element?<br />&bull;	What is the evidence that the memory elements will operate in the 4-10 K temperature range necessary for compatibility with SFQ logic circuits?<br />&bull;	Is fabrication compatible with SFQ logic, or would separate chips be required?<br />&bull;	How would the memory interface with the mV-level signals typical in SFQ circuits?<br />&bull;	Including interface circuits, what read and write times (latency and throughput) are expected?<br />&bull;	What energy dissipation is expected per read and write?<br />&bull;	How is the energy dissipation expected to scale with the amount of memory (number of bits)?<br />&bull;	What is the timescale needed to demonstrate these solutions?<br />&bull;	What are the compelling advantages?<br />&bull;	What challenges are foreseen?<br />&bull;	What resources are needed?<br />&bull;	Are supporting technologies available?</p>
<p>The responses to this RFI will be used to help in the planning of a one-day workshop.  The selection of topics, participants, and setting of the agenda of this workshop will in part be informed by the responses, with responders potentially being invited to participate and present at this workshop.  The results of this workshop may justify a competitive program.  It is anticipated that this workshop will be held on or about 19 July 2011.</p>
<p>Preparation Instructions to Respondents<br />IARPA solicits respondents to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in formulating a potential program.  IARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, and comment on the expected performance, robustness, and estimated cost of the proposed approach.  This announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response.  No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed. <br />IARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources from within and outside of the US.  Because IARPA is interested in an integrated approach, responses from teams with complementary areas of expertise are encouraged.  Responses have the following formatting requirements: <br />1.	A one page cover sheet that identifies the title, organization(s), respondent's technical and administrative points of contact - including names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of all co-authors, and clearly indicating its association with IARPA-RFI-11-01; <br />2.

<DESC>It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate for additional licenses and software maintenance renewal services. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. NIH requires SUDAAN software maintenance to support its mission for basic research. NIH researchers use SUDAAN to analyze clustered data, including complex sample surveys, randomized experiments, and epidemiological studies. SUDAAN is an internationally recognized statistically software package that specializes in providing efficient and accurate analysis of data from studies. SUDAAN provides modeling procedures which include both linear and multinomial-logistic models. SUDAAN fits marginal or population-averaged models using generalized estimating equations (GEE). SUDAAN is the only software package to offer all three popular robust variance estimation methods in its descriptive and modeling procedures: (1) Taylor series linearization (GEE for regression models), (2) Jackknife (with or without user-specified replicate weights), and (3) Balance Repeated Replication (BRR). Currently, all nine of SUDAAN's analytic procedures offer these three methods. Together, these procedures and techniques provide a powerful variety of analytic tools not available in any other commercially-available software product. In addition, a critical feature of SUDAAN is that it is available for a wide variety of computing platforms including PCs under Windows, PCs under Linux, and Sun workstations under Solaris.&nbsp;NIH researchers, especially visiting fellows, must have the tools they have used to develop their science at their disposal, rather than being forced to learn new tools that may not provide the required functionality.<br /><br />RTI has not authorized any other party to provide these software maintenance or technical support (help desk) services. These software licenses are mission-critical basic research. Support for these licenses is absolutely required. RTI is the only source capable of providing this support.<br /><br />Sources having the ability to provide the services described above shall provide clear and comprehensive information supporting their experience, past performance and pricing. Any questions can be submitted to Cara Calimano, Contracting Officer, at 301-496-6546. All information received will be considered as part of a competitive acquisition. RESPONSES ARE DUE BY 12:00 PM LOCAL PREVAILING TIME ON June 24, 2011, AND SHALL BE SENT VIA E-MAIL TO: Calimac@mail.nih.gov. This requirement is being processed for CIT by the National Library of Medicine (NLM), NIH.<br />

<DESC>Statement of Work: National Recovery Month 2011 Major League Baseball Initiative
<p>Background:</p>
<p>National Recovery Month, now in its 22nd year, highlights the societal benefits of substance use disorder and mental health illnesses treatment, lauds the contributions of treatment providers and promotes the message that recovery from these disorders in all its forms is possible. The September observance also encourages citizens to take action to help expand and improve the availability of effective treatment for those in need. The month-long celebration educates policymakers, federal, state and local government entities, business leaders, substance abuse providers, and the general public about substance abuse and mental health illnesses as a national public health problem affecting millions of people and the crucial role treatment plays in reclaiming lives ravaged by these disorders. All activities and products produced and distributed in connection with the celebration advertise and promote the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) as leaders in the federal effort to expand the availability of effective substance use disorder and mental health illnesses treatment and recovery services to all Americans.</p>
<p>The 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) reports that in many areas there is an increase in the use or misuse of substances in comparison to the 2008 report. For instance, current illicit drug use increased among the nation's adolescents. The rate of adolescents ages 12 to 17 acknowledging drug use in the past month rose from 9.3 percent in 2008 to 10.0 percent in 2009.</p>
<p>The report also indicates that the use of cigarettes remained the same from 2008 to 2009 among people ages 18 to 25. This last figure, however, had been gradually decreasing from 45.3 percent in 2002 to 40.8 percent in 2008. Similarly, the level of underage drinking, ages 12 to 20 remained stagnant from 2008 to 2009. Current alcohol use among underage persons steadily dropped from 2002 to 2008 but rose in 2009.</p>
<p>Among the most notable findings was that the level of current marijuana use among youth ages 12 to 17, which had declined significantly from 8.2 percent in 2002 to 6.7 percent in 2006 and stayed there until 2008, increased to 7.3 percent in 2009. <br />There was also an increase in the misuse of prescription drugs. Nonmedical use of prescription drugs among young adults aged 18 to 25 increased from 5.5 percent in 2002 to 6.3 percent in 2009, due largely to an increase in the nonmedical use of prescription pain relievers from 4.1 percent in 2002 to 4.8 percent in 2009.</p>
<p>In general, the 2009 survey reveals that an estimated 22.5 million persons (8.9 percent of the population ages 12 and older) may have had either substance abuse or dependency problems in the past year. Of these, 3.2 million were dependent on or abused both alcohol and illicit drugs; 3.9 million were dependent on or abused illicit drugs but not alcohol; and 15.4 million were dependent on or abused alcohol but not illicit drugs.</p>
<p>The survey also shows that the problems of substance abuse and mental illness are often intertwined. For example, among the 45.1 million adults aged 18 or older with any mental illness in the past year, 19.7 percent met criteria for substance dependence or abuse. Moreover, among the 11 million adults aged 18 or older with a serious mental illness (SMI) in the past year, 25.7 percent also had past year substance abuse dependence of abuse.</p>
<p>Goals and Reasons:</p>
<p>The Major League Baseball (MLB) initiative will be an integral part of SAMHSAs 22nd annual National Recovery Month. The effort proposed is to collaborate with the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America (CADCA) and continue work with local organizations to coordinate and sponsor National Recovery Month events involving both the professional league and the minor league baseball community. The National Recovery Month MLB events will recognize the need to support treatment for alcoholism, drug addiction, and mental health illnesses and educate people that these disorders know no boundaries in race, gender, culture and social and economic status. Baseball has been coined as America's National pastime and millions of Americans tune into and attend Major League Baseball games. MLB players and coaches become household names and children and adults admire them as heroes and leaders. Because of the admiration baseball players and coaches receive from people, they add value to events, initiatives and activities held by civic leaders and the community, and therefore, encourage greater participation and involvement.</p>
<p>SAMHSA has sponsored the National Recovery Month MLB initiative since 2004. The aim for the 2011 observance is to grow the attendance record of each event and to engage major figures of MLB and recognized public elected officials and their spouses in order to draw increased media attention to these events. Additionally, this year Recovery Month will collaborate with CADCA to garner additional participation and interest in the recovery-oriented events. CADCA, the nation's leading drug abuse prevention organization, represents the interests of more than 500 community coalitions in the country. They are also instrumental in training local grassroots groups, known as community anti-drug coalitions, in effective community problem-solving strategies, teaching them how to assess their local substance abuse-related problems and develop a comprehensive plan to address them. The 2011 theme, "Join the Voices for Recovery: Recovery Benefits Everyone!" highlights the physical, emotional, economic, and social benefits that health reform will bring to individuals, families, and communities. This campaign draws attention to the importance of treatment and recovery, and the positive effect that a united community can have on those suffering from substance use and mental health disorders. The month-long celebration also attempts to educate policy makers, federal, state and local government entities, business leaders, treatment services providers, and the general public about substance abuse and mental health illnesses as a national public health problem affecting millions of people and the critical role treatment plays in reclaiming lives, ravaged these disorders. <br /><br />As with all of the National Recovery Month efforts, the proposed community events will advertise and promote SAMHSA as a leader in the federal effort to expand the availability of effective treatment and recovery services available to Americans. This goal is consistent with SAMHSA's strategic initiatives: prevention of substance abuse and mental illness and recovery support. These events aim to assist attendees in developing prevention prepared communities where families, schools, faith-based organizations, workplaces, and communities take action to promote emotional health and reduce the likelihood of mental illness and substance abuse. The proposed events also focus on other SAMHSA's strategic initiatives such as: public awareness and support; and healthcare reform. A continued key focus of the 2011 celebration is treating the whole person, not just the disorder. In addition, the community events support the overall Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) goal of demand reduction and other Administration treatment initiatives.</p>
<p>SAMHSA activities and events must give special consideration and emphasis in the coordination of the community-based events to promote the interests of special emphasis groups and minorities. These groups include African American, Asian Pacific Islander, Hispanic, American Indians/Alaskan Natives, older Americans, adolescents and youth, medication-assisted therapy patients, and the disabled community.</p>

<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>I. Contracting Organization: The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</p>
<p>II. Description of Action: Sole Source</p>
<p>III. Description of Supplies/Services: National Recovery Month 2011 Major League Baseball Initiative</p>
<p>The Major League Baseball (MLB) initiative will be an integral part of SAMHSAs 22nd annual National Recovery Month. The effort proposed is to collaborate with the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America (CADCA) and continue work with local organizations to coordinate and sponsor National Recovery Month events involving both the professional league and the minor league baseball community. The National Recovery Month MLB events will recognize the need to support treatment for alcoholism, drug addiction, and mental health illnesses and educate people that these disorders know no boundaries in race, gender, culture and social and economic status. Baseball has been coined as America's National pastime and millions of Americans tune into and attend Major League Baseball games. MLB players and coaches become household names and children and adults admire them as heroes and leaders. Because of the admiration baseball players and coaches receive from people, they add value to events, initiatives and activities held by civic leaders and the community, and therefore, encourage greater participation and involvement.</p>
<p>SAMHSA has sponsored the National Recovery Month MLB initiative since 2004.

This campaign draws attention to the importance of treatment and recovery, and the positive effect that a united community can have on those suffering from substance use and mental health disorders. The month-long celebration also attempts to educate policy makers, federal, state and local government entities, business leaders, treatment services providers, and the general public about substance abuse and mental health illnesses as a national public health problem affecting millions of people and the critical role treatment plays in reclaiming lives, ravaged these disorders. <br /><br />The collaboration of SAMHSA/CSAT and CADCA will successfully work to expand the reach of Recovery Month and awareness that prevention works, treatment is effective, and people recover. SAMHSA/CSAT works to educate consumers that treatment is effective and recovery is possible. SAMHSA recognizes that prevention, early intervention and treatment of mental and substance use disorders are an integral part of improving and maintaining overall health and that treatment must be personalized to best fit the consumer's needs in order to achieve maximum benefit of services provided. <br />CADCA's work aligns to support three of SAMHSA's Strategic Initiatives: Prevention of Substance Abuse and Mental Illness, Recovery Support, and Public Awareness and Support.</p>
<p>IV. Authority: 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(FAR 6.303-2(a)(4)</p>
<p>V. Efforts to Obtain Competition: At Recovery Month Planning Partner Meeting as we let organizations know of future opportunities that will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities website and encourage them to apply. At that time and at present there are no organizations that are interested or capable of providing this service. Additionally, smaller organizations have held this contract in the past and they have been unable to complete the tasks fully. This contract is a logical follow-on to previous actions.</p>
<p>VI. Fair and Reasonable Costs: Research has revealed that the price of this initiative and ongoing outreach is fair and reasonable based on comparison to other training efforts.</p>
<p>VII. Market Research: Market Research was conducted to see if there were any small business that could provide this requirement. Market Research was conducted via the web and then CCR, based on this it was determined that there were no small business that could provide these services.</p>
<p>VIII. Other Facts: The Proposed Contractor is the nation's leading drug abuse prevention organization, represents the interests of more than 500 community coalitions in the country. They are also instrumental in training local grassroots groups, known as community anti-drug coalitions, in effective community problem-solving strategies, teaching them how to assess their local substance abuse-related problems and develop a comprehensive plan to address them. They are in a position to support the community organizations that will host the local events because of their unique leadership capacity. It would not be in the government's interest to advertise this requirement as full and open because CADCA is uniquely positioned to complete this requirement at a fair and reasonable, price.</p>

This patent application involves a novel, proprietary air-cooled heat exchanger technology, known as the "Sandia Cooler" or alternatively the "Air Bearing Heat Exchanger".  The current solicitation regards licensing opportunities in the field of electronics chip cooling.  Sandia will be establishing a separate process for exploring partnering and/or licensing opportunities in other fields.<br /><br />In conventional chip cooling schemes, the heat transfer bottleneck is the boundary layer of "dead air" that clings to the cooling fins.  In this new device architecture, heat is efficiently transferred across a narrow air gap from a stationary base to a rotating structure that combines the functionality of cooling fins with a centrifugal impeller.  Dead air enveloping the cooling fins is subjected to a powerful centrifugal pumping effect, providing a 10x reduction in boundary layer thickness.  This enables a dramatic improvement in cooling performance within a much smaller package.  Additionally, high speed rotation minimizes the problem of heat exchanger fouling.  The way in which the cooling fins slice through the air greatly improves aerodynamic efficiency, which translates to extremely quiet operation.  The above benefits have been verified on a proof-of-concept prototype approximately sized for cooling of computer CPU's.<br /><br />For further information, please reference the following:<br />
<p>&bull; EERE Tech Portal: https://techportal.eere.energy.gov/technology.do/techID=527<br />&bull; White paper: http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/2010/100258.pdf<br /><br />Companies interested in licensing Sandia Cooler technology for chip cooling applications should provide the following: 1. Company name and address; 2. The name, e-mail address and telephone number of a point of contact; 3. A brief statement (no more than 500 words) of interest, intent and capabilities relevant to commercializing this technology.<br /><br />Please e-mail responses, as well as questions, to cooler@sandia.gov.  Responses should be submitted no later than July 15, 2011.<br /><br />Sandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Company, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

The offerors quote shall be labeled in a consistent manner with this document. Offerors are expected to submit a quote in sufficient detail to allow the Government evaluation without the need for further clarifications. The Government does not assume the duty to search for data to cure problems it finds in quotes. The burden of proving acceptability remains with the offerors. 
General: The quote shall be presented in sufficient detail to allow Government evaluation of the response to the requirements of the request for quote (RFQ). The Government will not assume offerors possess any capability, understanding, or commitment not specified in the quote. All inquiries/questions concerning this procurement, either technical or contractual, must be submitted via email to the Contracting Office, phone call inquiries will NOT be accepted. No direct discussion between the technical representative and a prospective offeror will be conducted. USACC, BLCC, Attn: ACC-PICA-JA, Katelyn Warren: Katelyn.a.warren@us.army.mil 
*FOB Destination  Benet Laboratories, Watervliet Arsenal, NY 

1.   Basis for Award:  The Government plans to award a single firm fixed price purchase order as a result of this Request for Quotation (RFQ). The evaluation of quotes shall be conducted based on the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the government as reflected by the evaluation actors established below at #3.  Careful, full and impartial consideration will be given to all proposals received in response to the contemplation letter, and the evaluation will be applied in a similar matter. The government will weigh the relative benefits of each proposal, and award will be made based on an integrated assessment of the  technical (capability of item(s) offered to meet the government need), and price which will be most advantageous to the government. Under this evaluation approach of Best Value, a quote capable of Part H of the technical requirements above will receive additional credit for exceeding the established minimum defined requirements of technical acceptability. However, a quote capable of Part A through G of the technical requirements above will still be found capable to compete. Therefore, the government reserves the right to award to other than lowest priced offeror or to other than the highest technically rated offeror. 
1.1 Discussions: The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial quote should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.
2. Areas to be Evaluated:  The government will weigh the relative benefits of each proposal, and award will be made based on an integrated assessment. The order of importance for evaluation is (1) Technical and (2) Cost. 
3. Evaluation Approach: Careful, complete, and impartial consideration will be given to all quotes received pursuant to this RFQ. A team of Government personnel will evaluate each quote in the areas described below.
In order for a quote to be deemed acceptable it must meet all of the following minimum criteria:  Offerors must submit a quote for a quantity of one (1) re-circulating chiller that at a minimum meets Part A through G of the technical requirements and capabilities above. 
(1) Technical: The technical portion of the quote will be rated acceptable or unacceptable based on assessment of the stated minimum requirements below. These items are deemed critical to meet the Governments requirement. If any one of these requirements is rated as unacceptable this will result in an overall technical rating of unacceptable and the quote will not be considered any further. 

(2) Price: Price will be evaluated for reasonableness. The Government will evaluate quoted price per unit and overall total quoted price. 
Price Inconsistencies: A quote is presumed to represent an offerors best effort to respond to the solicitation. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between promised performance and price, shall be explained in the quote. Any significant inconsistencies, if unexplained, raise a fundamental issue of the offerors understanding of the nature and scope or the work required and their financial ability to perform the contract, and may be grounds for rejection of the quote. 
Please complete provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; OR indicate that your companys representations and certifications are current and available via Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). Quotes must be received No Later than 05 July 2011 4:30pm, Eastern Standard Time (EST).

Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br><br>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br><br>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br><br>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>GSA's Integrated Workplace Acquisition Center (3QSA) is issuing the Solicitation on or about June 20, 2011, electronically only. The Schedule is entitled FSC 71, Furniture. This Solicitation number is 3QSA-JB-100001-B, Refresh #4. 

Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to a sis (6) months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received.

<p>The elements being rates are as follows:<br /><br />a. Quality of Product or Service -</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory- Non-conformances is jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards containing similar requirements.<br />Poor - Overall compliance requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.<br /><br />Fair - Overall compliance requires minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.<br /><br />Good - There are no, or very minimal, quality problems, and the Contractor has met the contract requirements.<br /><br />Excellent - There are no quality issues, and the Contractor has substantially exceeded the contract performance requirements without commensurate additional costs to the Government.<br /><br />Outstanding - The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that was significantly in excess of anticipated achievements and is commendable as an example for others, so that it justifies adding a point to the score.

<p>Unsatisfactory - Ability to manage cost issues is jeopardizing performance of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, this level of ability to manage cost issues constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards.</p>
<p>Poor - Ability to manage cost issues requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Fair - Ability to control cost issues requires minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.<br />Good - There are no, or very minimal, cost management issues and the Contractor has met the contract requirements.</p>
<p>Excellent - There are no cost management issues and the Contractor has exceeded the contract requirements, achieving cost savings to the Government.</p>
<p>Outstanding - The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where the contractor achieved cost savings and performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".<br /><br />c. Timeliness of Performance</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory - Delays are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards.</p>
<p>Poor - Delays require significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Fair - Delays require minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Good - There are no, or minimal, delays that impact achievement of contract requirements.</p>
<p>Excellent - There are no delays and the contractor has exceeded the agreed upon time schedule.</p>
<p>Outstanding - The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".<br /><br />d. Business Relations</p>

If not substantially mitigated or corrected it should constitute a significant impediment in considerations for future awards.<br /><br />Poor - Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is marginally effective.<br /><br />Fair - Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is somewhat effective.<br /><br />Good - Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is consistently effective.<br /><br />Excellent - Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues exceeds Government expectation.<br /><br />Outstanding - The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score.

A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
 Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  
 
FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement.  
(a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.

(i) TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION OF PROPOSED ITEM
(ii) PAST PERFORMANCE
(iii) PRICE

Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.
  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  A will comply statement without accompanying technical specifications and/or drawings of product being offered is automatic failure under this factor.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below.

Only those Offers which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) and delineated in CLIN0001 above will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating the offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE combined with factor (i) is approximately equal to Factor (iii), PRICE.

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.
  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   

(b)  TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION OF PROPOSED ITEM.  Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating technical information submitted in response to this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated and determined to be either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 

(c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.
  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 

Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.

UNSATISFACTORY:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.

(End of Clause)

Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ .
 

Additional instruction to offerors: Offers shall include following:
(1)	Signed priced offer on company letterhead (see FAR 52.212-1) with point of contact information, DUNS, Cage Code, business size/type, and payment terms.
(2)	Technical Specifications of items with drawings and/or photos; chassis must include brand name, trim level, year of manufacture, and engine size
(3)	Statement addressing how minimum requirements, if not in technical drawing/specifications, will be met
(4)	Filled-in FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The incumbent serves as a Senior Contract Specialist in the Management Bureau, Office of Acquisition and Assistance (M/OAA). The employee is responsible for work assignments in support of the Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance Bureau, Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI) involving the preparation of pre-award and post-award procurements of significant importance to the Agency, to ensure the efficient and rapid implementation of DCHA/OTI political transition programming overseas. Requirements for acquisition and assistance instruments are awarded for highly visible and complex countries in crisis involving sensitive international programs. This is a key position in a busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations. For M/OAA to support DCHA/OTI in implementing its rapid response strategy, it is essential that prompt procurement support is provided. The incumbent must have a strong sense of responsibility, a high customer service standard, be highly organized, pay close attention to detail, and be able to complete task with minimal guidance.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire a Senior Contracts Specialist who will assist the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES<br />The position requires either: knowledge of contracting principles, laws, regulations and procedures applicable to pre-award and/or post-award actions sufficient to procure and/or administer contracts for major development, testing, and/or production, or mastery of a procurement functional area sufficient to provide expert technical leadership, staff coordination, and consultation including responsibility for formulating guidelines, implementing new developments, and providing policy interpretation. Familiarity with business strategy and program or technical requirements is required to sufficiently perform direct in-depth evaluations of the financial and technical capabilities, or the performance of the contractor.<br />Policies and precedents are available but stated in general terms or are of limited use. Extensive searches of a wide range of regulations and policy circulars are frequently required. The employee uses experienced judgment and initiative in applying principles underlying guidelines, in deviating from traditional techniques, or in researching trends and patterns to develop new approaches, criteria, or proposed policies.<br />The work is characterized by breadth of planning, review, and coordination or depth of problem identification and analysis, stemming from the variety of the procurement functions or from the unknowns, changes, or conflicts inherent in the issues. Decisions involve responsiveness to continuing changes in programs or technological developments. Procurements typically require new or modified contract terms and conditions, funding arrangements, or policy interpretation throughout the pre-award or post-award phases.<br />The Senior Contracts Specialist will:</p>
<p>&bull; Perform contract administration activities for significant, highly specialized procurements which directly support DCHA/OTI's field programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Monitor and evaluate contractor performance to assure compliance with technical, financial, delivery, and other terms of the contract.</p>

<p>&bull; Following award of the procurement action, develop schedules for oversight and administration of the award; identify reporting requirements and monitor compliance with reporting requirements; advise OAA staff of issues stemming from noncompliance with contract terms and/or deadlines;</p>
<p>&bull; Establish close coordination with the COTR/AOTR/supervisor on assigned actions; respond to questions from these officials as needed, conferring with the CO/AO as needed;</p>
<p>&bull; Draft procurement documents as requested, including contracts, grants and cooperative agreements, and amendments or terminations thereto;</p>
<p>&bull; Serves as negotiator on behalf of the OAA principal officer (contracting officer, grants officer, etc.), resolving issues independently to the maximum extent possible;</p>
<p>Perform other contract specialist duties as required.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to George Washington University, School of Public Health and Health Services, Department of Health Policy, 2021 K. Street, NW, Suite 800, Washington, DC, for updated legal surveys and analyses of state laws related to (1) vaccination benefits for adult Medicaid beneficiaries, (2) provision of vaccination services by non-physician healthcare providers under standing orders, and (3) vaccination requirements for employees and residents in long-term care facilities, based on three previous reviews conducted by George Washington University. Purpose and Objective: Legislative Review &amp; Analysis of State Laws Related to Immunization. The purpose of this project is to update three comprehensive legislative reviews exploring laws related to immunization in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Topics covered by these reviews include (1) vaccination benefits offered to adult Medicaid beneficiaries, (2) scope of immunization practice by non-physician practitioners under their own license and standing orders protocols, and (3) vaccination requirements for staff and residents at long-term care facilities. State immunization laws are constantly evolving in response to new scientific discoveries, political pressures, and other external factors. Updating these reviews will ensure that CDC has access to the most current information available related to state immunization laws. This information is critical to CDC&rsquo;s ability to (1) track the impact of healthcare reform on access to vaccination benefits and (2) to conduct and provide technical assistance for emergency preparedness planning that fully utilizes available healthcare resources in each state. Public health authorities at the national, state, and local levels will benefit from understanding how non-physician providers can be used to expand vaccination opportunities both during pandemic or bioterrorism events as well as during non-emergency vaccination campaigns. Policymakers and researchers can use information about Medicaid vaccination benefits to monitor potential disparities in access between currently eligible beneficiaries and those who gain coverage under Affordable Care Act expansions of Medicaid. The goal of this contract is to build on work already completed by researchers at the George Washington University (GWU) School of Public Health and Health Services as part of The Epidemiology of U.S. Immunization Law project. GWU published three reports on the above-referenced topics between Winter 2003 and Winter 2007 (research was completed from approximately Spring 2003 to Spring 2007). These reports have served as important references for CDC researchers and grantees in the interim. CDC is perceived by state and local health authorities and researchers as the preeminent resource for information related to public health, up to and including laws and regulations governing public health. As a result, the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases regularly receives queries from the public on aspects of state law pertaining to immunization. The updates proposed in the present statement of work will provide CDC with the information needed to furnish appropriate technical assistance to its grantees and to the public, as well as targeting our efforts in collaboration with professional and other organizations. Specific objectives of this contract are to: (1) Update the 2003 report produced for CDC as part of The Epidemiology of U.S. Immunization Law to include new legislation as needed: &ldquo;Medicaid Coverage of Immunizations for Non-Institutionalized Adults.&rdquo; (2) Update the 2007 report produced for CDC as part of The Epidemiology of U.S. Immunization Law to include new legislation as needed: &ldquo;State Laws Related to the Use of Standing Orders Covering Immunization Practice.&rdquo; (3) Update the 2005 report produced for CDC as part of The Epidemiology of U.S. Immunization Law to include new legislation as needed: &ldquo;Immunization Requirements for Staff and Residents of Long-Term Care Facilities Under State Laws/Regulations&rdquo; (4) Update the project website housed at www.gwumc.edu/sphhs/departments/healthpolicy/immunization/ to display the updated reports and related materials as necessary. (5) Develop and submit manuscripts to peer-reviewed, legal and public health journals and health professional newsletters and magazines disseminating findings of updated legal review. Background and overview: CDC provided initial funding for The Epidemiology of U.S. Immunization Law in 2002. The overall goals of the Project were to achieve greater understanding of the policy barriers to immunization financing and access and furnish technical assistance support to initiatives that promote change. These reports have served as important references for CDC researchers and grantees in the interim. During the recent H1N1 influenza pandemic, there was particular interest in understanding how non-physician providers could assist in mass vaccination efforts in order to rapidly increase communitywide coverage with 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine. However, interest in expanding access to vaccination services has prompted changes in state law since 2007, particularly with regard to immunization practice by pharmacists. In addition, personnel shortages experienced during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic response may have prompted states to expand the scope of practice of non-physician providers in preparation for future emergency response activities. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 expands Medicaid eligibility to persons living at up to 133% of the federal poverty level, representing a significant expansion in coverage for childless adults. Newly-eligible Medicaid beneficiaries will have access to all ACIP-recommended vaccines without cost-sharing as determined by provisions of the ACA; however, current adult Medicaid beneficiaries are not covered by these provisions. In order for CDC to monitor the effect of the ACA on access to vaccinations, a baseline level of benefits must be established. Since GWU&rsquo;s initial report, three new vaccines (human papillomavirus, tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis, and herpes zoster vaccine) have been recommended for use among some adults 18-64. In addition, increasing budgetary pressures at the state government level have likely affected benefits provided to current Medicaid-eligible adults. Increased interest in vaccination of healthcare personnel as an important indicator of healthcare quality has increased the prominence, and potentially the prevalence, of state laws requiring vaccination of healthcare personnel in various healthcare settings. The Joint Commission is currently updating its accreditation standard for influenza vaccination of staff in long-term care facilities to expand the facilities covered and the activities required for accreditation. A review of current laws related to vaccination requirements in long-term care facilities will determine which states may be better equipped to comply with national reporting requirements related to vaccination of healthcare personnel in long-term care settings. With the exception of the proposed contractor, no organization or unit within or outside CDC currently tracks and summarizes laws related to the above-referenced topics. In the absence of the proposed review, there is no central repository of legal information that can inform the planning, monitoring, and technical assistance activities described in Section 1.0. Scope of Work: For this project, the Contractor will submit a plan for completion of the work described herein. Throughout the award period, the Contractor will submit reports describing progress toward completion of the project tasks. At the end of the project period, the Contractor will summarize findings during the time of the project and submit three reports detailing changes in state laws related to the topics described above. More detailed requirements are given below. Place of Performance/Hours of Operation: Work will take place at the contractor&rsquo;s site. Period of Performance: The period of performance is 24 months from the date of award. Technical Services Required: Legal review and analysis to discover and synthesize changes in the legislative environment related to Medicaid benefits for adults, scope of immunization practice by non-physicians, and vaccination requirements in long-term care facilities. (See tasks 2.1) Tasks: The contractor shall: Task 1: Update report on Medicaid immunization benefits for non-institutionalized adults. Within 12 months of award of the task order, the Contractor will complete data collection as necessary to update the Medicaid report, to include benefits for HPV, zoster, and Tdap vaccines. Data collection will include a survey of state Medicaid directors regarding their future plans for adult immunization benefits and total state expenditures on immunizations for Medicaid beneficiaries. Within 24 months of award, the Contractor will submit the final updated report. CDC may request a preliminary final report for review within 18 months of the award. Task 2: Update report on state laws covering immunization practice by non-physician providers under their own license or via the use of standing orders. Within 12 months of award of the task order, the Contractor will complete data collection as necessary to update the standing orders report, to include medical assistants. Within 24 months of award, the Contractor will submit the final updated report. CDC may request a preliminary final report for review within 18 months of the award. Task 3: Update report on vaccination requirements for staff and residents in long-term care facilities. Within 18 months of award of the task order, the Contractor will complete data collection as necessary to update the long-term care facilities report. Within 24 months of award, the Contractor will submit the final updated report. CDC may request a preliminary final report for review. Task 4: Update &ldquo;Epidemiology of Immunization Law&rdquo; project website. Within 24 months of award of the task order, the Contractor will update the project website at www.gwumc.edu/sphhs/departments/healthpolicy/immunization/index.cfm to include the updated reports described in the previous tasks. The Contractor will also modify existing graphic depictions of project results (i.e. the Standing Orders Project map) to reflect the findings of the current task order. Task 5: Develop manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals. Within 24 months of award of the task order, the Contractor will, in conjunction with CDC scientists, draft and submit to CDC clearance at least one manuscript describing the findings of the above-referenced tasks for submission to a peer-reviewed journal. All publications based on project data will need to be cleared by CDC, even manuscripts drafted or published after the end of the performance period. Specific Task Deliverables: See tasks above. (1) Medicaid immunization benefits report, (2) Scope of immunization practice/standing orders report, (3) Vaccination requirements of long-term care facilities report, (4) Web site, (5) Manuscripts for publication, (6) The Contractor shall bring problems or potential problems affecting performance to the attention of the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) as soon as possible.

<DESC>The following is merely an overview of the requirement. See all attachments for the complete solicitation package. <br /><br />__________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) requires facilities management, maintenance &amp; logistics support services for the International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) training facility/campus in Roswell, New Mexico. <br /><br /><strong>Overview of Scope</strong> <br /><br /><br />
<p>PROGRAM SUMMARY: The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) advises the President, Secretary of State, other bureaus in the Department of State, and other departments and agencies within the U.S. Government on the development of policies and programs to combat international narcotics and crime.</p>
<p>One of INL's major goals is the enhancement of the professionalism of foreign criminal justice officials to enable them to efficiently combat crime in their respective countries and, at the same time, prevent the movement of transnational criminal elements into the United States and throughout the world. An effective and efficient way to accomplish this goal was the creation of an ILEA providing training to a global student body. In furtherance of this effort the Department of State established an International Law Enforcement Academy located in Roswell, New Mexico. The ILEA in Roswell became operational in 2001. The Academy has a dedicated campus facility with two training rooms, a series of small break-out rooms, administrative offices, a computer lab, and office space for instructors.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide facility management and maintenance for the ILEA Roswell facility in Roswell, NM. The contractor shall also provide delegation logistical support for international students attending the ILEA Roswell training program in Roswell, NM. INL plans to host approximately 400 - 500 foreign government officials per year, multiple weeks at a time, as participants in various Department of State foreign policy and technical outreach training programs.</p>
<p>The contractor will coordinate all activities - facility and international delegations logistics - with the ILEA training facilitator to support the overall ILEA training program.</p>
<p>________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The Government is conducting a single source selection under this solicitation and intends to award one (1) contract by conducting a 100% HUBZone set-aside competition in accordance with FAR Part 15. We anticipate a one year contract with four one-year options which the Government reserves the right to unilaterally exercise any or all one-year options (IAW FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract).</p>
<p><strong>Telephone requests for the solicitation will not be accepted.</strong></p>
<p>QUESTIONS: Prospective offeror(s) should submit any questions regarding this solicitation in writing by e-mail Contract Specialist, Terry Lord.

The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 339112 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.

PURPOSE

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct market research and obtain information regarding potential solutions to replace the existing Internal Revenue Service (IRS) non-contact center telephone services with an Enterprise Voice over IP (VoIP) and Unified Communications solution that results in convergence of the network and voice infrastructure, as well as convergence of the user experience.  The converged solution will provide all required functions and features outlined in the attached Configuration, Technical and Functional Requirements document, and will put the IRS in a position to reap the future benefits of Internet Protocol (IP) enabled technology.  Further, this RFI will help to identify possible new or alternative solutions available in the marketplace which will introduce additional features and lower total cost of ownership. 

Responses to this RFI will be used to accomplish the following:

  Collect industry input on the attached Configuration, Technical and Functional requirements
  Gain insight into vendor designs supporting the attached requirements
  Identify alternative designs that provide added value to the IRS


TERMS

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes, and does not constitute a solicitation or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Should the IRS issue a solicitation, the IRS may consider using the Connections II, Alliant or NASA SEWP IV contract if appropriate, and if Connections II is awarded in time.

REQUESTED INFORMATION

At this time the IRS is finalizing the configuration, design, technical and functional requirements for this project.  The attachment to this notice contains the current draft of these elements.  Vendors are encouraged to provide a proposed high level design based on the configuration requirements in the attached document, and provide comments on these requirements.  Vendors are encouraged to identify major system hardware and software components and approximate quantities recommended at the DMVPN hub locations, a typical Category 1 site and a typical non-Category 1 (smaller) site.  Vendors are encouraged to provide input on their various maintenance support offerings, including 24/7 maintenance associated with software, hardware and licensing.  

Vendors are also invited to provide alternative design options along with any rationale as to why the alternative design would be more advantageous to the IRS than the design contained in this RFI.  

Interested vendors are requested to submit a maximum fifty (50) page statement of their knowledge in these areas, as well as their capabilities to meet the requirements outlined in the attached Configuration, Technical and Functional Requirements document.

RESPONSES

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with PerkinElmer LAS 710 Bridgeport Avenue Shelton, CT 06484. The National Institutes on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Division of Intramural Research in Baltimore, Maryland conducts studies that measure alterations in ion channel function, and synaptic circuits in the brain following exposure to commonly abused drugs. This research is heavily dependent upon confocal microscopy to measure ion channel function with voltage and ion sensitive fluorescent dyes, and for the identification of fluorescent proteins expressed in nerve cells from genetically modified mice. Confocal microscopy requires high-powered laser light to activate fluorescent molecules. The laser that was original to our confocal microscope has recently failed after 8 years of daily use. Because of this, we require a replacement laser and power supply to permit our time-sensitive studies to continue. The confocal system components, including the scan head, camera controller and The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Additional Questions to Industry:

In addition to the information previously requested, industry responders are encouraged to address significant capabilities not already identified in the RFI that would be of value in the execution of MCOTEA's mission.  Such additional information shall be incorporated as additional rows in the spreadsheet response.

Lastly, the government is seeking Industrys advice on appropriate incentive structures that a contractor would find value in should the government solicit a contract type of Fixed Price Incentives Fee (FPI).

Questions and Answers to Date--

Q - Is it the governments intent to limit responses in Part One to the per cell character limits inherent to Excels functionality?

A - The government, and specifically MCOTEA, is currently using MS Office Excel 2007 and the character limits for an individual cell are considered to be adequate, given the constraint on the size of RFI responses.
  If necessary, contractors can insert an additional row within the spreadsheet to provide an effective description of relevant capabilities.

Q - If it is the governments intent to limit responses as described in question 1, could the government clarify these limits specifically?

A - It is not the government's intent to limit responses, other than to constrain the overall length of the RFI response.

Q - If it is not the governments intent to limit responses as described in question 1, how does the government prefer respondents address any need to use multiple cells in response to any single item identified in Part One?   

A - It is not the government's intent to limit responses, other than to constrain the overall length of the RFI response.
 If necessary, contractors can insert an additional row within the spreadsheet to provide an effective description of relevant capabilities.   

Q - Will the government consider allowing respondents to utilize a MS Word table for responses to Part One?

A - Responses shall be in Excel spreadsheet format.

Q - Part One provides instructions on the core capabilities utilizing the Matrix provided.  Are we to assume the response to Part One is to incorporated within the Matrix provided?  Or will a supplemental narrative be expected as well?  

A - Responses shall be in Excel spreadsheet format addressing each of the governments called out areas.  Should the contractor not exceed the 25 page limit and have additional page availability after addressing each of the areas within the Excel matrix template provided, then the contractor may choose to submit additional information by means of his own choosing.

<DESC>correction to the initial RFI posting:  paragraph 4 now reflects MCOTEA website at: 

http://www.quantico.usmc.mil/activities/?Section=MCOTEA


Additional Questions from Industry as of 15 April 2011:


Q - Who is the current incumbent? 

 
A  see earlier Q/A posting


Q - What is the approximate current / expected level of effort in terms of the number of contractor personnel performing this mission?

A - Current efforts equate to approximately 95 Full Time Equivalents (FTEs).  Future levels of effort are expected to be comparable.  Workload and associated Contractor support requirements may change (in either direction) by 10% to 20% during a given year based upon test support requirements.
  
 

Q - What is the approximate mix between ground, amphibious and air systems involved in MCOTEA's work load portfolio?

A - MCOTEA does not evaluate air systems.  OT&E efforts are aligned with 4 Test Divisions.  The Divisions are identified on the MCOTEA website referenced in the RFI.  The approximate mix in work efforts between the Divisions may change substantially as a result of changes in program support requirements.  At present an approximate mix is: MAGTF C4ISR (35%), Expeditionary Test Division (18%), Ground Combat Test Division (8%), and Combat Service Support Test Division (10%).  Additionally, there are efforts that are not Division specific including Information Assurance assessments, Model Verification & Validation, and operational contingency evaluation support (30%).
  

Q - NACIS code 541330 is identified at the top of the RFI document.  The size standards as listed on the SBA site for this particular code are as follows:

A -  541330 Engineering Services; Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons $27 MILLION

<DESC>	JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION IAW FAR 6.203-2
VETERANS BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION


Upon the basis of the following justification, I hereby approve the issuance of the contractual action described below using other than full and open competition, pursuant to the authority cited herein.

1.  Contracting Activity

     Department of Veterans Affairs
     Veterans Benefits Administration
     Office of Facilities Management (20M31)
     Washington, DC  20420

2.  Nature of Action Being Approved:  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intends to procure from C-CAT, Inc. for materials and labor to install cabling, security and AV infrastructure for the VA Regional Office in Indianapolis, IN.  C-CAT, Inc. is an emerging small business with a GSA Schedule that was a subcontractor on phase I of our renovation project.  It is in the government's best interest to sole source this task to C-CAT, Inc. We are currently in the phase II construction and due to unusual and compelling need, we don't have time to compete out this project.  Per FAR 6.302(2) the delay would result in financial loss by having the Regional Office (RO) operational.  They are the only responsible source that has current access to the Federal Campus and VA space would allow the VA to avoid unnecessary burdens to complete this requirement.  We are expecting occupancy of this space by the end of November 2011.  It was determined that C-CAT would use their GSA schedule to provide pricing for this project. 

3.   Description of Service and Supplies:  This justification and approval sets forth the facts and request approval for a contract to be issued with a vendor that is certified and authorized on the GSA Schedule.  The required services are mandatory to satisfy the relocation date and minimize any interruptions to the Regional Office.  The proposed contract costs are estimated at $856,250.00

4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority of this justification is FAR 6.302 (2).

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  The RO  is currently located partially in two different swing space sites, 10 miles away from their permanent location at Federal Building which is under renovation and has to relocate on the above date to minimize additional charges.  GSA has established an aggressive schedule for this relocation and the installation of the cabling, audiovisual and security equipment must coincide with the construction schedule for this project.  The construction for this project has started and is scheduled for completion in November 2011.  Any delays with this project will have a direct negative impact on the Regional Offices and the phase two of the VARO renovation project.  Currently the Regional Office has taken partial occupancy of the office space and must be fully operational at the above date.

6.  Description of Market Research:  N/A

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable:  Prices are determined to be reasonable and  are consistent with the contractor's GSA schedule pricing.

8.  I certify that this justification is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The United States Army Medical Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis,IAW FAR 13.501(1)(ii) under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996), with Crist Instrument Co Inc, 111 West First Street, Hagerstown, MD 21740, as the only responsible source that can provide the customized items needed to fulfill this acquisition.<br>This requirement is for various customised cart systems and 1-9 channel Biela Commutator to add more support/continuity on approved small rodent protocols. Compatibility and interchangeability of these items with existing systems used at MRICD will increase the reproducibility of results from these instruments. To maintain data integrity, these systems must be compatible or data comparisions will be invalid and it will be a costly waste of animals. There are not other commercially available systems that are exactly identical to the current systems already provided by Crist Instrument Inc. <br>All capability statements received by closing of this notification of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Based on the above information, the only technically acceptable system is provided by Crist Instrument Co. Submit email capability statements (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments) to Jackie McGurk at, Jacklyn.McGurk@amedd.army.mil. Fax quotes may be sent to 410-436- 4863; Attn: Jackie McGurk. Email statements are preferred. Statements are due no later than 1:00 P.M. EST on 08 JUL 2011. No telephone calls will be accepted.
