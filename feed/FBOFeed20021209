<SUBJECT>A--Department of Defense Foreign Comparative Test Program for High Power Density Fuel - FY 2003
<SOLNBR>DAAB15-03-R-0004
<RESPDATE>012303
<ARCHDATE>03242003
<CONTACT>Patricia Davis, 703-325-1713
<DESC>NA The US Army CECOM RDE Center, Army Power Division, has received approval from the Department of Defense to initiate the Foreign Comparative Test Program for High Power Density Fuel in Fiscal Year 2003. The five candidate fuel cell power systems are the 2 k W fuel cell system manufactured by Intelligent Energy of the United Kingdom (qty: 5); the 25 Watt fuel cell power system manufactured by SmartFuel Cells, Bmbh of Germany (qty: 5); the 650 Watt PEM fuel cell power systems manufactured by NoVars, Gmbh of Ger many (qty: 5); the 1 kW fuel cell power systems Ballard Power Systems of Canada (qty: 5); and the 500 Watt fuel cell power system manufactured by Hydrogenics, Inc of Canada (qty: 5).  The candidates are non-developmental (in production or fielded) fuel cel l power systems (not considering stack-only units) with the capability to produce 12 or 24 volt DC power from a variety of non-logistic fuels. Several categories of fuel cells are sought in both the 25 watt and greater than 500 watts sizes, as follows:  hy drogen-based systems, hydrogen-based hybrid systems (with battery), methanol systems, and alternative fuel systems.  Hydrogen-only systems must offer power/weight densities of 800 W/kg or greater.  Hybrid systems must offer 10 W/kg or greater power density  (this number includes fuel for 6 hours operation at rated load).  All non-hydrogen fuels must be capable of refueling at an energy density greater than 700 W-hrs/kg.  All systems must be aurally non-detectable at 100 meters.  All systems should be rugged enough to support field use for battery charging and other troop support power requirements.  All systems must be capable of operation in ambient temperatures ranging from 10C to 520C.  The resulting contracts will also include options for test support inc luding spare parts supply, analysis of data, troubleshooting and operator training.  The test support will include both laboratory and field tests, and will occur in the Mar 2003-Sep 2004 timeframe.  The statutory authority for other than full and open com petition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), 'Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements'.  Specifically, other than full and open competition is permitted for Foreign Comparative Testing under the application of Defe nse Acquisition Regulation (DFAR) 206.302-1(b) which states that the 'authority may be used for acquisitions of test articles and associated support services from a designated foreign source under the DoD Foreign Comparative Testing Program'.  However, all  responsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can provide a non-developmental (in production or fielded) fuel cell power system with a capability which can successfully meet the above requirements may submit a quote to be consid ered by the agency. Technology suitable for testing by July 2003 will receive consideration.  Responses should be no longer than ten (10) pages.  The resultant contracts will be firm fixed price.  Responses are to be received via email no later than close of business 23 January 2003.  All requests for further information must be in writing or via email, telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. You may forward responses to the following e-mail address:  pat.davis@cacw.army.mil.  Ack nowledgement of receipt will be issued.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>This notice is the official pre-solicitation notice under the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) solicitation #DTFR53-02-R-0008. The Department of Transportation, FRA, has a requirement to acquire contractor support services capable of evaluating the Guided Lamb Wave (GLW) approach of the Acoustic Emission Testing (AE) when applied to tank cars. The contractor will evaluate a refined AE inspection in its present state.  AE testing is considered a passive technique due to the fact that the sensors just "listen" and any sound that is detected is usually generated by a defect under load.  If a pulsar were to be added to the AE setup, the equipment being tested could be periodically pulsed to determine the state of the material between the pulsar and the AE receivers.  This form of active monitoring can be categorized as a GLW approach and will be the basis of the
Request for Proposal (RFP).  The following tasks are to be performed.  Task 1 - Kick off meeting, Task 2 - Determine Sensitivity Requirements, Task 3 - Develop Inspection Standards, Task 4 - Data Collection, Task 5 - Data Analysis, Task 6 - Software Development Part I, Task 7 - Software Development Part II, Task 8 - Field Testing, Task 9 - Further Data Analysis, Task 10 - Demonstration & Evaluation.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) award is anticipated. The period of performance will be 14 months from date of award. The solicitation for this proposed contract will be available to interested parties via the internet at www.FEDBIZOPS.gov.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be available.  Potential offerors shall be responsible for monitoring the Internet site for the release of the solicitation, amendments (if any), and responses to any questions submitted in accordance with the solicitation.  Issuance of the Request for Proposal is anticipated on or about September 1, 2002. This is an unrestricted solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by the FRA.

<DESC>AFMETCAL Det 1 intends to award a sole source purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures to VMetrix for the purchase of an Upgrade of Josephson Junction Voltage Standard.  Issue date 9 Dec 02.  Closing date 24 Dec 02.  The proposed procurement under Request for Quotation (RFQ) F33660-03-Q-0003 is for VMetrix to upgrade the existing system by having selected hardware and software components either upgraded or replaced with more modern and improved technology components.  Supplies and/or services are available from only one responsible source.  No other type of supply and/or service will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  If no written response is received at AFMETCAL by 24 Dec 02, to the effect that comparable supplies/services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these supplies/services through a sole-source procurement with VMetrix, a sole-source award will be made.

<DESC>Solicitation Notice, NAICS Code 541330  Title: Advanced Engine Testing and Optimization.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seeks proposals to provide it with a service contract for the on-site operation of Government-provided test cells (located in Ann Arbor, Michigan) to perform flexible engine power train testing and optimization related to small displacement engines with efforts focused on testing for emissions and improved efficiency (lower carbon dioxide emissions).  This work is in support of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality's National Vehicle and Fuels Emission Laboratory (NVFEL) Advanced Technology Division in its continuing work to develop advanced clean and fuel efficient automotive technology to better protect the environment and to save energy.  This Clean Automotive Technology (CAT) program includes researching and testing hybrid vehicle technologies to examine their fuel economy and reduced carbon dioxide emission potential. 	Work will primarily include testing of engines, but limited testing of power trains, subsystems, control systems, hydraulic pump motors and fuel systems may be necessary.  It may be necessary to convert testing equipment to alternate-fuel emission operation if not capable.  Alternate fuels to be addressed will include alcohol fuels and may also include natural gas, DME, petroleum gas, and reformulated gasoline.  However, a large part of the work may include work with petroleum-based fuels.  It is expected that the majority of testing will be performed on EPA supplied engines.   	The contractor shall provide qualified engineering personnel including backup personnel and tools to operate the EPA on-site test cells.  The contractor shall also have experience and capability in calibrating and testing prototype automotive components, including components used in engines, subsystems, control systems, and fuel systems as well as experience in the fabrication of unique parts, calibration and optimization of advanced prototype engines, new concept screening that requires on-the-spot decisions on one-of-a-kind prototype engines and components.  The contractor shall also be able to accommodate modifications and fabrications of Direct Injection Fuel Injection Systems and engine components such as cylinder heads. 	The Government anticipates the award of a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee Level of Effort (LOE) with a 12-month Base period and four (4) twelve month option periods.  It is anticipated that each period will consist of a base level-of-effort of 6,000 hours with an option to increase the level of effort by an additional 18,000 hours each period.  The solicitation is subject to Full and Open competition.  The full Statement of Work will be included as an attachment to the solicitation.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal provides the best value to the EPA, technical, price and other factors considered.  The full technical evaluation criteria will be included in the solicitation.  	It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available on or about 27 January 2003 at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/  It is estimated proposals will be required within 45 days of solicitation issuance.  POC for this solicitation is Camille Warfield, Contract Specialist, at (513) 487-2095, or via e-mail at Warfield.Camille@epa.gov  Telephone requests will not be honored.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  FAR Part 12 procedures will not be used.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation RFQ5-154980 on a sole source basis for studies of Low Energy Neutral Atom (LENA) Modeling Work. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to procure this effort from the Mission Research Corporation under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. The Government requires a study that will begin with a series of local Monte Carlo calculations to see how the steady state ion and neutral velocity distributions develop for a given perpendicular heating rate and neutral density for the LENA investigation.  Next, one-dimensional (radial) transport studies will be performed to see how the neutral velocity distribution develops with increasing altitude and decreasing neutral densities.  Finally a two-dimensional (radial and latitudinal, assume axial symmetry) transport study will be done to see what fraction of the neutrals produced in a local region can be collisionally deflected outward from the earth by collisions at points away from their source region. Mission Research Corporation's participating scientist, Dr. Gordon R. Wilson, is the Principal Investigator for this study.	Dr. Wilson has been actively involved both in planning for the mission and in the analyis of the data obtained.  His efforts have focused primarily on data from the LENA investigation, where he has specialized in the peculiar observations obtained from the perigee parts of the spacecraft orbit.	Due to his extensive  experience and unique expertise in low energy ion-neutral interactions, Mission Research Corporation is the only corporation uniquely qualified to perform this study. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 20, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Mr. J.N.A. Nunoo, Managing Director and Mr. F.K. Brew, Chief Manager, Planning and Development, Ghana Water Company Limited, P.O. Box M194, Accra, Ghana, Phone (233) 21-665-649, Fax:  (233) 21-663-552  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a water distribution system from the Volta River in Ghana to Lom?, Togo.

In recent months, Ghanaian President Kufuor has expressed his desire to improve Ghanaian-Togolese relations.  This water supply project was designated as a priority of the President and is viewed as significant to regional and bilateral relations.  Kufuor?s prioritization of this project was underscored by the fact that he met personally with U.S. Trade and Development Agency's (USTDA) Definitional Mission team in Accra.  Since the signing of the Grant agreement with USTDA in July 2002, the Ghanaian officials and their counterparts in Togo have conducted bilateral negotiations with the goal of expanding the scope of the study to ensure implementation of the project.

The project involves the construction of a water treatment facility on the Volta River at Sogakope, Ghana.   A volume of 190,000 cubic meters will be taken in every day and treated.  Approximately 80 kilometers of transmission pipelines will link Ghanaian communities east of Sogakope to treated water.  The pipeline will end at the Togolese border, where the Togolese water company, R?gie Nationale d'Eau du Togo (RNET), will take 91.5 percent of the total water passing through the pipeline.  

The U.S. firm selected to perform the study will be required to review overall objectives of the project, review conceptual design documents that have been prepared to date,
collect available data that will be used as the basis of design; visit potential locations for the intake structure, treatment plant, reservoir, booster stations and visit the riparian villages to be supplied up to Aflao.  Further, the selected U.S. firm will establish a preliminary draft project schedule which will assess feasible alternatives including the transfer of raw water to Lom? and treated water to Ghanaian communities as well as the transfer of treated water from the source to both Lom? and Ghanaian Communities.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $440,000 grant to the Grantee from the USTDA.  The Ghana Water Company Limited is seeking a potential developer for the project to conduct the feasibility study and the Grant Agreement includes an implied cost-share of $135,000 making the total level of effort to complete the Terms of Reference $575,000.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 10:00 a.m., February 28, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

There will be a site visit for this contract on December 5th.  It is strongly encouraged that all contractors that are seriously considering submitting an offer attend the site visit.  Contracts in Guantanamo Bay are unique in nature and actually seeing the facilities will help to understand the conditions and enable the offeror to submit a more competitive proposal.

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Algeria:  Port of Algiers Second Container Terminal Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to upgrade the productivity of the existing container facility at the Port of Algiers and possibly develop a second container terminal that satisfies its needs.

Of the eleven major multipurpose ports in Algeria, the Entreprise Portuaire d'Alger (EPAL) has the largest container traffic.  At present, seventy percent of Algerian container traffic passes through the Port, and this activity has increased rapidly over the past seven years.  EPAL plans to address the increased demand by adding additional rows for storage containers and improving cranes for lifting and stacking containers.  To accommodate growth, the construction of a second container terminal has been proposed.  In addition to examining the potential market for the proposed second container terminal, the feasibility study will evaluate options for increasing productivity at the existing container terminal through logistics management and information technology improvements.

The study represents Phase I of an assessment of the viability of this project.  Upon the completion of the Phase I study, the U.S. firm selected by EPAL to perform the Phase I study shall submit a final report to EPAL and TDA.  TDA would then consider, subject to the availability of funds, providing additional funds to cover Phase II study costs.  TDA authorization to proceed with TDA grant funding for Phase II would be set forth in a letter to EPAL and the selected Contractor.  TDA is under no obligation to cover expenses incurred by the Contractor or any other entity for such a Phase II study if TDA does not provide such specific written authorization to proceed.  The Contractor must be capable of completing both Phase I and Phase II.  

The objective of this Feasibility Study is to assess upgrading the productivity of the existing container facility at the Port of Algiers in Algeria and possibly develop a second container terminal that satisfies its needs.  The tasks for Phase I are as follows:  1.1) review of existing cargo demand and development of projections, 1.2) development of alternatives, and 1.3) Phase I final report.  The proposed Phase II tasks are as follows:  2.1) selection of alternative, 2.2) detailed improvement planning for the existing container terminal, 2.3) conceptual design for a second container terminal, 2.4) cost estimating, investment plan and financial analysis, 2.5) environmental assessment, 2.6) financing options and privatization analysis, and 2.7) Phase II final report.    

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $217,050 grant to the Grantee (EPAL) from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and in French directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M. local Algerian time on Monday, December 16, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<SUBJECT>Z -- Fragmentation Retention Film
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-C4255-N60495-FRAGFILM
<RESPDATE>013103

<DESC>This is a sources sought request for commercial items. Due to sensitivity of this project, the fragmentation film specification and proper, experienced application of the specialized fragmentation film is paramount. The vendor must have some form of documented performance record of success with high risk/threat areas within the Department of Defense and other federal agencies. All qualified companies, please submit performance documentation, to include where performance was accomplished, technical specification information, along with business size to ROICC, Bldg 307, 2nd Floor, NAS Fallon, NV 89496-5000. Point of Contact is Lisa Eyrich 775-426-3206 or alternate Belinda Bratcher 775-426-2926. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS: The Fragmentation Retention Film (FRF) being sought shall  be an optically clear polyester, polyethylene terephthalate, or a composite.  It must be multi-layered or factory laminated and include an abrasion resistant coating on the exposed surface.  The film shall have an optically clear, weather resistant, pressure-sensitive adhesive that shall contain ultraviolet (UV) inhibitors that prevent 95 percent of radiation between 300 and 380 nanometers.  The adhesive shall not be water activated.  A water-soluble detackifier and/or release liner may be used over the adhesive to make film application easier.  MINIMUM PERFORMANCE: As a minimum level of performance, the film must pass American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z97.1 OR CFR Title 16, Part 1201, Category II impact tests. These tests include samples that have a simulated 1-year exposure to sunlight and UV radiation.  TEST SAMPLE: For the purposes of the test, the film should be attached to a piece of 1/4-inch thick flat glass conforming to the requirements of ASTM C 1036, Type I, Class 1, Quality q3.   PASSING CRITERIA: After the impact portion of the test, satisfactory performance of the test specimen is determined using ANSI 797.1, paragraph 5.1.3 or CFR Title 16, Part 1201, paragraph 1201.4(e) on the interpretation of results.  To be acceptable for use as FRF, the manufacturer must provide a statement that the film satisfactorily performed according to ANSI Z97.1, paragraph 5.1.3(1), (3), or (4) or with CFR Title 16, Part 1201, Paragraph 1204.4(e)(1)(I), (iv), or (v) without tearing.   TENSILE STRENGTH: The tensile strength of the film shall be 25,000psi minimum.   THICKNESS: Minimum thickness should be based upon design requirements.  Ten-mil film is recommended for most applications.   PEEL STRENGTH: The peel strength should be a minimum of 4.7 pounds/inch for 7-mil and thicker films.   
OPTICS AND TINT: All film, regardless of color, should be optically clear from the inside to ensure an undistorted view through the glass.  Color, tint, and reflectivity, when required, shall be specified by the requiring activity.  The amount of reflectivity of solar radiation is specified as a percentage.   FLAME SPREAD AND SMOKE DENSITY: When required by life safety or local building codes, the requiring activity shall specify a flame spread rating and a smoke density rating for the film.  The film should not exhibit a flame index exceeding 25 and a smoke density index exceeding 100 when tested in accordance with ASTM E 84.  For the purpose of testing, the specimen should be mounted to 1/2-inch thermally tempered glass.   MANUFACTURERS QUALIFICATIONS: The film shall be a standard product of the manufacturer and intended for the purpose described in the specifications.  Only films designed for fragment retention will perform in an acceptable manner.   CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS: The Contractor shall ensure the manufacturers cleaning instructions are provided, as many cleaning compounds are not compatible with film.   WARRANTY: The film shall have at least a 7-year warranty against cracking, crazing, delaminating, peeling, or changing color.   INSTALLATION: Installation of FRF for new construction is not required.   Retrofit Application: Film can be installed beyond the frame edge to improve retention characteristics of the glass panel.  However, any extension of the film past the inner frame edge will require at least partial frame dismantling.  For this application, the glazing should be removed and the film applied to the outside edges of the glazing material, which extended into the frame bite.  If dismantling is too expensive, the requiring activity may require a daylight application where the film is applied to within 1/16 inch of the edge of the visible glazing.   FILM SPLICE: The film may be spliced or lapped when a glazing dimension exceeds 60 inches in either direction.  All seams or splices shall be applied with a butt joint.  For windows with seams, catch bars should be placed at 90 degrees to the seam direction.  For installation where smash-and-grab theft is also a concern, seams should always be horizontal.   VISUAL INSPECTION: Within 30 days of application, the adhesive should be 95 percent cured.  No water bubbles, foreign particles, or excessive distortion shall be visible when viewed by the unaided eye from a distance of up to 10 feet from the interior room side at angles up to 45 degrees.   APPLICATION: This film is attached directly to the glass surface.  FRF shall be applied on the interior of windows for protection from the effects of spalling.  For double-glazed units (insulated glass), apply the film to the room (protected) side of the innermost frame.  Specify that the film must be applied in strict accordance with the manufacturers application instructions.  If the film is used on double-glazed units, film anchorage on two sides is strongly recommended to improve glass retention of the unprotected outside glazing.   QUALIFICATIONS OF PERSONNEL: Personnel applying or supervising the application of the FRF shall be certified by the film manufacturer.   ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES: The film will not be applied if there are visible dust particles in the air, if there is frost on the glazing, or if any room conditions such as temperature or humidity do not meet the manufacturers instructions.  The manufacturer must be informed about the environment the film must withstand, such as exterior atmosphere, solvents, chemicals, or excessive humidity.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce,Southeast Fisheries Science Center, Miami, FL, intends to purchase services for molecular/immunological services from Duane Schultz, Miami, FL. This services is the immunologic determination of the sex and reproductive status of billfish. Reliable tools for determining the sexual identity and reproductive condition of billfish are needed: 1) to properly interpret the movement of electronically and conventionally tagged fishes; and 2) to significantly improve stock assessments by enabling the collection of sex-specific catch data. This project is a continuation of work previously conducted. In order to further develop and refine immunologic assays and tools thus far developed qualified sources must be able to perform the following task: 1) Synthesize or obtain from commercial suppliers the following antisers: (a) anti-vitellogenin (VTG) (b) anti-testosteron (T); (c) anti-11- testosterone (11-KT); and (d) anti-estradiol-17 (E-B). 2) acquire and process National Marine Fisheries Service collected gonat, muscle and blood samples from male and female billfish. Samples will be extracted in physiologic buffers and a standard immunologic assay for each antiserum (ELIZA)will be developed to detect the presence of VTG,T,11-KT, and E-B.. An immuno-flurescent assays will subsequently be developed.  These assays are precursors to developing "field kits" for biologists to sample at tournaments and/or from commercial landings. The proposed contract actions is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Any small business sources, able to provide this service is encouraged to respond to this announcement within 15 calendar days after its publication.

<DESC>MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS: The Fragmentation Retention Film (FRF) being sought shall  be an optically clear polyester, polyethylene terephthalate, or a composite.  It must be multi-layered or factory laminated and include an abrasion resistant coating on the exposed surface.  The film shall have an optically clear, weather resistant, pressure-sensitive adhesive that shall contain ultraviolet (UV) inhibitors that prevent 95 percent of radiation between 300 and 380 nanometers.  The adhesive shall not be water activated.  A water-soluble detackifier and/or release liner may be used over the adhesive to make film application easier.  MINIMUM PERFORMANCE: As a minimum level of performance, the film must pass American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z97.1 OR CFR Title 16, Part 1201, Category II impact tests. These tests include samples that have a simulated 1-year exposure to sunlight and UV radiation.  TEST SAMPLE: For the purposes of the test, the film should be attached to a piece of 1/4-inch thick flat glass conforming to the requirements of ASTM C 1036, Type I, Class 1, Quality q3.   PASSING CRITERIA: After the impact portion of the test, satisfactory performance of the test specimen is determined using ANSI 797.1, paragraph 5.1.3 or CFR Title 16, Part 1201, paragraph 1201.4(e) on the interpretation of results.  To be acceptable for use as FRF, the manufacturer must provide a statement that the film satisfactorily performed according to ANSI Z97.1, paragraph 5.1.3(1), (3), or (4) or with CFR Title 16, Part 1201, Paragraph 1204.4(e)(1)(I), (iv), or (v) without tearing.   TENSILE STRENGTH: The tensile strength of the film shall be 25,000psi minimum.   THICKNESS: Minimum thickness should be based upon design requirements.  Ten-mil film is recommended for most applications.   PEEL STRENGTH: The peel strength should be a minimum of 4.7 pounds/inch for 7-mil and thicker films.   
OPTICS AND TINT: All film, regardless of color, should be optically clear from the inside to ensure an undistorted view through the glass.  Color, tint, and reflectivity, when required, shall be specified by the requiring activity.  The amount of reflectivity of solar radiation is specified as a percentage.   FLAME SPREAD AND SMOKE DENSITY: When required by life safety or local building codes, the requiring activity shall specify a flame spread rating and a smoke density rating for the film.  The film should not exhibit a flame index exceeding 25 and a smoke density index exceeding 100 when tested in accordance with ASTM E 84.  For the purpose of testing, the specimen should be mounted to 1/2-inch thermally tempered glass.   MANUFACTURERS QUALIFICATIONS: The film shall be a standard product of the manufacturer and intended for the purpose described in the specifications.  Only films designed for fragment retention will perform in an acceptable manner.   CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS: The Contractor shall ensure the manufacturers cleaning instructions are provided, as many cleaning compounds are not compatible with film.   WARRANTY: The film shall have at least a 7-year warranty against cracking, crazing, delaminating, peeling, or changing color.   INSTALLATION: Installation of FRF for new construction is not required.   Retrofit Application: Film can be installed beyond the frame edge to improve retention characteristics of the glass panel.  However, any extension of the film past the inner frame edge will require at least partial frame dismantling.  For this application, the glazing should be removed and the film applied to the outside edges of the glazing material, which extended into the frame bite.  If dismantling is too expensive, the requiring activity may require a daylight application where the film is applied to within 1/16 inch of the edge of the visible glazing.   FILM SPLICE: The film may be spliced or lapped when a glazing dimension exceeds 60 inches in either direction.  All seams or splices shall be applied with a butt joint.  For windows with seams, catch bars should be placed at 90 degrees to the seam direction.  For installation where smash-and-grab theft is also a concern, seams should always be horizontal.   VISUAL INSPECTION: Within 30 days of application, the adhesive should be 95 percent cured.  No water bubbles, foreign particles, or excessive distortion shall be visible when viewed by the unaided eye from a distance of up to 10 feet from the interior room side at angles up to 45 degrees.   APPLICATION: This film is attached directly to the glass surface.  FRF shall be applied on the interior of windows for protection from the effects of spalling.  For double-glazed units (insulated glass), apply the film to the room (protected) side of the innermost frame.  Specify that the film must be applied in strict accordance with the manufacturers application instructions.  If the film is used on double-glazed units, film anchorage on two sides is strongly recommended to improve glass retention of the unprotected outside glazing.   QUALIFICATIONS OF PERSONNEL: Personnel applying or supervising the application of the FRF shall be certified by the film manufacturer.   ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES: The film will not be applied if there are visible dust particles in the air, if there is frost on the glazing, or if any room conditions such as temperature or humidity do not meet the manufacturers instructions.  The manufacturer must be informed about the environment the film must withstand, such as exterior atmosphere, solvents, chemicals, or excessive humidity.

<SUBJECT>R--CCR Registration
<DESC>In compliance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB)/Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) FY 2003 performance requirements for expanding on-line procurement, beginning October 1, 2002, Department of the Interior contracting personnel will: Use the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov), as the single validated source of data on vendors doing business with Interior.  Prospective vendors must be registered in CCR prior to the award of a contract; purchase order, delivery order, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchase agreement by Department of the Interior bureaus and offices.  Prime contractors are not required to have their subcontractors register in CCR.  However, if a prime's subcontractor wants to bid directly for contracts with the Department of the Interior, they should register in the CCR. Exceptions to the CCR Registration Requirements:  The above policy applies to all types of awards except the following, as identified in Department of the Interior Financial Administration Memorandum No. 98-034, Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996-Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Policy and Implementation Guidelines, dated December 17, 1998, and Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 32.11, Electronic Funds Transfer: 1.  Purchases paid with a Government-wide commercial purchase card; 2.  Convenience Check transactions; 3.  Awards paid to foreign vendors where the political, financial, or communications infrastructure in a foreign country does not support payment by EFT; 4.  Payment to a recipient within an area designated by the President or an authorized agency administrator as a disaster area (This exception is limited to payments made within 120 days after the disaster is declared); 5.  A response to contingency operations conducted by or in support of the Department of Defense; 6.  Where payments by EFT may pose a threat to national security, the life or physical safety of an individual may be endangered, or a law enforcement action may be compromised; 7.  Where the bureau does not expect to make more than one payment to the same recipient within a one-year period, i.e., payment is non-recurring, and the cost for making the payment by EFT exceeds the cost of making payment by check; 8.  Where a bureau's need for goods and services is of such unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless payment is made by a method other than by EFT; or where there is only one source for goods and services and the Government would be seriously injured unless payment is made by a method other than by EFT. In addition, effective October 1, 2003, Department of the Interior bureaus and offices will no longer accept or maintain Standard Form 129, Solicitation Mailing List Applications as a source of vendor information.

<SUBJECT>A -- AEF - Industry Day Announcement
<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Flight Vehicles Integration Branch (AFRL/MNAV) is announcing an Industry Day briefing and optional, afternoon and next-day, one-on-one team appointments for the Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) Munition program.  The AEF Industry Day will be held at Eglin AFB, FL, beginning at 0800 on Wednesday, 15 Jan 03, in conjunction with the Persistent Area Dominance (PAD) Industry Day announced under MNK-PRDA-03-0004.  Foreign-owned companies are prohibited from participation at the prime contractor level, but may take advantage of available subcontracting opportunities.  

The AEF munition program objective is to develop a next-generation, miniature, long-range, standoff weapon for use in conjunction with today's highly mobile and forward-deployed Air Expeditionary Forces.  The program will involve exploration and integration of airframe, micro-munition dispensing, propulsion, data link, and payload integration technologies into an AEF Munition.  These new technologies will provide a low-cost, long-range, compact, and precise munition to defeat sophisticated mobile and limited fixed enemy targets.  Current cruise missiles address the need for a long-range standoff weapon, but these relatively expensive systems are limited to large launch platforms and fixed target sets.  The AEF Munition will employ miniature technologies, which allow delivery from legacy and next-generation fighter/bombers against mobile and fixed enemy targets.  The weapon's efficient propulsion system will allow for long-range midcourse cruise before micro-munitions are released against an intended target.  The payload to defeat the target may consist of a unitary warhead or use multiple dispensed guided micro-munitions to increase target kills per sortie.  The challenge is to design a robust suite of technologies that will integrate into a low-cost solution.  The Government anticipates one contract award for an approximate 3-year program.

Although the conference will be unclassified, visit requests and approved DD Forms 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, are required.  For one-on-one team appointments, limit team size to a total of five personnel.  Interested parties/firms must schedule attendance and identify personnel attending the AEF Industry Day briefing, and one-on-one team appointments, prior to 7 Jan 03, with the AEF Program Manager, Dr. Mike Valentino, at 850-882-8878, ext. 3331, email michael.valentino@eglin.af.mil, telefax 850-882-4793.  Dr. Valentino can also provide visit request and specific meeting locations information.

<SUBJECT>A -- Collision Avoidance (CA) Program
<DESC>COLLISION AVOIDANCE (CA) PROGRAM INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT.  POC Ms. Michelle Kalphat, RDECOM STC, Fax (407) 384-5454. E-MAIL: To send via e-mail questions regarding exact location and times of the CA Industry Day, Michelle_Kalphat@stricom.army.mil. The US Army PEO STRI, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826-3276 will initiate research in FY03 for COLLISION AVOIDANCE (CA) under BAA N61339-01-R-0023 issued in March 2001.  PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  This is the official notification/announcement  for an Industry Day for the Collision Avoidance Program to be held on behalf of Mr. Sam Wilson, DARPA/TTO Program Manager for the Collision Avoidance Program scheduled for Wednesday, 8 January 03, in Orlando, FL.  The goal of the Collision Avoidance (CA) program, as discussed at the CA Workshop held 30 September 02-2 October 02, is to prototype Collision Avoidance Systems highlighting advanced technology for Mirco Air Vehicles (MAVs) and Organic Air Vehicles (OAVs); assess  strengths and limitations of each Collision Avoidance system based on actual field experiments under the following conditions: Under Canopy, MOUT, Inside Buildings, and Inside Caves and Tunnels; develop and validate critical technology  for understanding Collision Avoidance system performance with coordinated use of small numbers of vehicles and degraded communications or sensors.  The CA Program is a 4 year DARPA program to develop a Collision Avoidance system for "Private Jones".  It is anticipated that the program will be a 3 Phased approach as presented at the CA workshop. Availability of funding beyond FY2002 will be predicated on the success of the technical research demonstrated during Phase I of the program effort. Great latitude in prototype architecture and testing methods for development are encouraged.   Field experiments for evaluation of strengths and weaknesses will focus development efforts and assist in understanding the tradeoffs in performance in conditions relevant to future missions for the vehicle.   PROGRAM SCOPE: Multiple awards are anticipated and may take the form of a contract, cooperative agreement, or technology investment agreement. Collaborative efforts/teaming is encouraged. Under technology investment agreements cost share must be 50/50 to the extent practicable. To the extent an offeror proposes 50/50 cost share or greater, the Government will consider waiving or reducing most patent and data rights. Contractors interested in presenting a poster session/display must request a display area within one week of the scheduled Industry Day, but no later than COB 03 January  2003 to Ms. Kalphat via email. WHITE PAPER/PROPOSALS SUBMISSION: Additional information regarding specific BAA information, questions regarding white paper/request for proposal submittals and evaluation criteria will be presented at the Industry Day. NON-GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL: Awardees under the CA Program will be required to exchange technical information with the participants selected in the other solicitations. All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in strict confidence. Restrictive notices, notwithstanding proposals, may be handled, for administrative purposes only, by SRS Technologies, Inc. of Arlington, VA, a support contractor which is bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. In addition, input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants and experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. These non-Government technical consultants will not have access to proposals that are labeled by the offerors as "GOVERNMENT ONLY." Only Government evaluators will make selections under the CA research effort.
