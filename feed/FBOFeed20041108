U.S. COAST GUARD
HU25 AILERON REPAIR
STATEMENT OF WORK
12 MARCH 04

1.0	BACKGROUND 
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate within salt-laden environments.  This condition accelerates the corrosive attack to the HU-25’s Ailerons (P/Ns MY20151-4 LH and MY20152-4 RH).
2.0	OBJECTIVE
2.1.	The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized 
repair center to effectively repair and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 aileron assemblies.  Repaired ailerons must meet the OEM’s critical profile and contour dimensions to ensure the fit to aircraft with minimal adjustment during installation.  In addition, corrosion preventative steps shall be incorporated during repair.
2.2.	The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of repair for these control surfaces.  First, a “baseline repair” would be required for ailerons that are subject to limited damage, such as exterior corrosion or impact damage and replacement of hardware and/or skin.  The Second level, “extensive repair” would include baseline repairs and the replacement of major extrusions, i.e., fittings.  The quoter shall provide a cost break down for items above and beyond a baseline repair.  At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the quote.  Quoters may submit additional levels of service.
3.0	To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives the quoter will be required to meet the following technical criteria: 
3.1.	The quoter is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited, required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance,  preservation, storage, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul these control surfaces
3.2.	Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling and fixtures to meet the OEM’s critical profile and contour dimensions.
3.3.	Past Performance.
3.3.1.	Provide documentation for having performed repair/overhaul of similar or like items.
3.3.2.	Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references’ name, company, phone number, and e-mail address
3.3.3.	Provide evidence of and ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.
3.0	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 
The following Technical Specifications are applicable:
a.	OEM drawings
b.	CG Technical Orders:
1.	CGTO 1U-25A-3 (Structural Repair Manual)
2.	CGTO 1U-25A-4, Chapters 57 (Illustrated Parts Catalog)
e.	Data Availability:

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement to include additional work via a modification to an existing purchase order # NNL04AM34P awarded to Innovative Materials and Testing Technology, Inc. (IMTT) on September 24, 2004. The additional work is described in Attachment 1.   NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the additional work requirements from IMTT because only IMTT is capable of satisfying NASA LaRC's requirement to include a completion schedule of not later than December 24, 2004. IMTT has accumulated significant knowledge and experience under purchase order NNL04AM34P and thus IMTT is uniquely capable to quickly and effectively respond to NASA LaRC's requirement.  The requirement for the original purchase order NNLO4AM34P was also synopsized as a sole source requirement on September 7, 2004;  NASA LaRC received no responses or inquiries to the synopsis and thus proceeded to award a non-competitive purchase order to IMTT.  Given the unique requirements of the additional work described in Attachment 1 and IMTT's unique capabilities, knowledge and experience, only IMTT is capable of meeting the NASA LaRC requirement. Therefore, NASA LaRC intends to execute a modification to the purchase order to add the additional work. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 15, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST), Microelectromechancial Systems Group (MEMS)  proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the University of Notre Dame for the development of advanced microfabricated atomic clocks.  NIST constructed and tested the first atomic clock physics package based on fabrication techniques usually used in microelectronics and micromachining.  There are several design changes to implement to improve the performance of the device.  Specific Tasks are as follows:  1) develop new structural designs for microfabricated atomic frequency references with the goal of reducing the power dissipation, improving the long-term frequency stability and simplifying the fabrication and assembly process; 2) collaborate with NIST MEMS group to accomplish the fabrication of individual elements; 3) assemble elements into functioning clock structure and 4) test assembled clock with regard to performance metrics such as frequency stability and power dissipation.  The research outlined above requires extensive expertise in the following areas:  1) precision measurements of optical and hyperfine transitions in alkali atoms, such as Cesium and Rubidium; 2) coherent population trapping and nonlinear excitation of atomic hyperfine resonances; 3) the use of diode lasers in atomic spectroscopy; 4) atomic clocks and frequency references; 5) excitation of high-order electromagnetic moments in atoms with coherent optical fields; 6) thermal modeling of microstructures.  The research also requires a post-doctoral-level researcher capable of carrying out independent research, writing research papers, presenting results at conferences.  The research group at the University of Notre Dame is uniquely qualified in this area. The work will be carried out by a post-doctoral researcher, Vladislav Gerginov, from the University of Notre Dame. Dr. Gerginov’s extensive experience carrying out precision measurements of atomic transitions in alkali atoms make him an ideal candidate to accomplish the tasks outlined in the statement of work above.  In his recent work measuring optical transitions in atoms, Dr. Gerginov has had substantial experience using and characterizing optical and microwave clocks and oscillators. Dr. Gerginov’s interaction with the Time and Frequency Division throughout the last two years entailed carrying out research in collaboration with the Optical Frequency Measurements Group on precision spectroscopy of Cs, which has made him familiar with many of the critical test and measurement techniques required for characterizing the micro-miniaturization atomic clocks.  The contract period is December 1, 2004 through November 30, 2005.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Terms and Conditions can be found on http://www.arnet.gov/far/ and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops/reflib/alp1296.htm.  A copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date – November 24, 2004.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Sean Murphy, 508-233-6255
<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM - Natick Contracting Division, in support of the US Army Soldier Systems Center-Natick has a requirement for a new Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) which will replace the helmet known as the Personnel Armor System Ground Troops (PA SGT). The ACH will provide an improved helmet to Soldiers that in addition to providing the Soldier ballistic and impact protection, will be used as a  platform to mount electronics such as communication devices, and Night Vision devices among other items.   As a helmet it will provide standard Helmet, Ground Troops and Parachutists and (PASGT) protection as well as increased 9mm protection. The reduced edge cut of the ACH, although reducing area of coverage, will improve the field of vision and hearing, l eading to better situational awareness over the current helmet. The ACH has five basic components: The helmet shell, the pad suspension system, the retention system (chinstrap/napestrap), helmet cover, and eye strap.  The Government anticipates that this r equirement will be a Full and Open Competitive acquisition, however, the Government reserves the right to change the solicitation procedure. It is anticipated that a final Fedbizopps Announcement and solicitation will be released in December 2004, with pro posals due in January 2005. Firms shall not be reimbursed for any costs associated with proposals.  The Government envisions that multiple Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts  will be awarded as a result of the R equest for Proposals (RFP) but reserves the right to award one or none. The Government anticipates a one-year Base Ordering Period, with four, one-year Options. If one contract is awarded, the anticipated minimum requirement is 100 ACHs and a maximum requi rement of  880,000 ACHs and applicable spare parts kits for the entire period of performance. If more than one contract is awarded the yearly requirements will be divided (ratio to de determined) among successful offerors. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE WILL THE TO TAL REQUIREMENT EXCEED MORE THAN 880,000 ACHs.  Offerors are to note that Federal Prison Industries (FPI) also known as UNICOR, is currently the mandatory source for helmets. Currently, UNICOR does not have a helmet that meets the ACH requirements. However , at some time UNICOR may develop a helmet that meets the ACH requirements. If the Contracting Officer makes a determination in the future that UNICOR helmets meets the Governments needs in terms of quality, price and time of delivery, UNICOR may be eligi ble to receive a portion of the aforementioned requirement. The required source for the chin strap, helmet cover and eye strap will be National Industries for the Severely Handicapped (NISH) and National Industries for the Blind (NIB). When released, the s olicitation, including all amendments, and applicable documents (with the exception of patterns, if applicable) will only be available in electronic medium at US Army RDECOM  Natick Contracting at https://www3.natick.army.mil .  It is anticipated that a d raft of the solicitation will be posted to the Natick website for comments no later than November 30, 2004.

SECTION L – INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS OR RESPONDENTS

SECTION L is Attachment 2

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a)  This acquisition will utilize the Technically Acceptable-Performance/Price Tradeoff (TA-PPT) source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision.  The NAVAIDS need to be compatible in performance and data protocol with CLIN 0001 through 0007. A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror’s proposal will be made. Meeting the schedule requirements is one of main the determining factors for contact award. For those offerors who are determined to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past performance and price.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the tradeoff process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the selection process.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as schedule, place of delivery, terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those included in paragraph (b)(1) below.

            
(b)   The TA-PPT evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:

     (1)  Technical.   Each offeror’s technical proposal will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach to meeting the government’s minimum requirements as described in the Schedule of Supplies.  Offeror’s proposals meeting the government’s minimum requirements will determined to be technically “acceptable”. The equipment needs to be standardized across the system for logistical, training, spare parts requirements and to enable it to be able to transmit data back to the ACC in Baghdad.  Installation of the NAVAIDs requires that these systems be compatible in performance and data protocol to the systems at Baghdad.
 
(2)  Performance.  For technically acceptable proposals, the past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet users’ needs including cost and schedule.  The currency and relevancy of the information, the source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered.  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The Government may consider an offeror’s contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

•	VERY RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this solicitation requires. 
•	RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. 
•	SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. 
•	NOT RELEVANT:  Did not involve any significant aspects of above.

In assessing present and past performance, the Government will employ several approaches, including, but not limited to:

(i).  Information utilized may be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, as well as from other sources known to the Government.  Data from previous source selections may be used if the data is recent and relevant.  Evaluation of present and past performance will include consideration of overall customer satisfaction and conclusions of informed judgment.  

	(ii).  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to  respond to the information.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence assessment will consider issues including, but not limited to, the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.

	(iii).  Past performance information will also be considered regarding any critical subcontractors and key personnel.  If an offeror, or the proposed key employees of the offeror, do not have a past performance history deemed relevant to this solicitation, the offeror will receive a neutral confidence rating.  The neutral confidence rating will be considered in the overall assessment for a best value decision.

	(iv) An overall confidence assessment rating will be made.  The following confidence assessment ratings apply:

Rating				Definition

Blue  			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
exceptional/high confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Green 		Based on the offerors record of performance there is very
good/significant confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Yellow		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
satisfactory/confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Grey			Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
neutral/unknown confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Black		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is
marginal/little confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Red			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
unsatisfactory/no confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

(3)  Price.  

 	    (a) IAW FAR Part 15.305 (a)(1) Cost or Price Evaluation, this competitive procurement will establish the basis for price reasonableness.
	
              (b) Total evaluated price, for award purposes, will be based upon the total price proposed
 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>Reference is made to the 18 October 2004 announcement, reference number 0430041B, inviting submission of qualifications and proposal data to develop a technical assistance program for a 120-megawatt coalmine/coalbed methane fired power plant for the Shanxi Jincheng Anthracite Coal Mining Group Company Limited (Grantee).

This announcement serves to inform prospective proposers on the above-referenced project about amendments to the subject Request for Proposal (RFP).

1) Additional information on potential supply of coal mine methane for feedstock on the 120 MW power plant:

Based on ADB-financed studies conducted in 2003, the ADB projected that CMM drained from the Sihe mine and CBM produced from surface wells that is available for power generation will be about 500,000 cubic meters (100% methane) a day by 2008 (or 182.5 million cubic meters a year). The ADB also confirmed that in case of any shortfall, other mines in the vicinity of the Sihe mine would be able to supply up to 200,000 cubic meters (100% methane) a day.  As a result, the ADB based the basic design of the power plant (installed capacity of 120 MW) on the availability of 500,000 cubic meters of methane a day.  The ADB will approach the Grantee during the week of November 8, 2004, to determine if more recent drainage figures are available with regard to CMM drainage from the Sihe mine.

2) Clarification on companies allowed to compete in the international competitive bidding process under ADB rules and procedures:

The ADB has issued this guidance with respect to vendors being allowed to bid on project implementation using ADB funds:  The issue is whether there is a conflict of interest between the role of the consultant to prepare nonrestrictive, technical specifications and other requirements with regard to the supply of the equipment that would attract the widest possible interest among potential bidders (thus promoting competition and the lowest possible price) and any other interests the consultant may have. If the latter includes an interest of the consultant to be able to win the supply contract by using technical specifications and other features of equipment in which it has a financial or other interest, there is obviously a conflict of interest. Therefore, if a consultant for the power plant (irrespective of source of financing, i.e., USTDA-grant assistance) is also a potential bidder for equipment to be financed by ADB, such a consultant will not be eligible for bidding for the ADB-financed package.  For further information about specific prohibitions on ADB ICB procedures, please contact Mr. Edu Hassing at the Asian Development Bank at the following address:

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  The US Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs (OJP), provides federal leadership in developing the nation's capacity to prevent and control crime, improve the criminal and juvenile justice systems, increase knowledge about crime and related issues, and assist victims of crime.  Through the programs developed and funded by its bureaus and offices, OJP works to form partnerships among federal, state, and local government officials to control drug abuse and trafficking; reduce and prevent crime; rehabilitate neighborhoods; improve the administration of justice in America; meet the needs of victims of crime; and address problems such as gang violence, prison crowding, juvenile crime, and white-collar crime.  Among other programs, OJP sponsors information sharing initiatives to improve the effectiveness and fairness of the justice system through better information sharing among all its components, including juvenile justice, law enforcement, prosecution, defense, adult courts, corrections, probation and parole.  Justice leaders place top priority on integrating information systems in order to: improve the operational efficiency of the justice process among stakeholders & across jurisdictions; provide all justice personnel critical information needed for their safety and to enhance service in a cost-effective manner; and to allow decision-makers to uphold the fundamental ideals of the justice system.  One of the programs supported by OJP to meet its mission is the Global Justice Information Sharing Initiative (Global).  Global is a “group of groups”, representing more than thirty independent organizations spanning the spectrum of law enforcement, judicial, correctional and related bodies representing Federal, state, local and tribal agencies.  The Global Advisory Council (GAC) operates under the auspices of the OJP and advises the Federal government, specifically, through the Assistant Attorney General, OJP and the US Attorney General.  The focus of Global is to promote more efficient sharing of data among justice entities by facilitating standards-based electronic information exchange throughout the justice and public safety communities.  The broad scope of the effort is fundamental and crucial to its success.  The Global Executive Steering Committee (GESC) provides leadership for the GAC.  Global aids its member organizations and the people they serve through a series of initiatives, including facilitating Global working groups, developing technology standards such as the Global Justice XML Data Model (GJXDM), creating white papers on data sharing issues such as the National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan, and disseminating information via Global-related Web sites.  The work of Global and the GAC is primarily carried out in Working Groups.  There are currently four Working Groups, which may at times be supported by subcommittees.  Work products of these groups are submitted for consideration and approval by the GAC in its advisory role.  The Criminal Intelligence Coordinating Council (CICC) was established in support of the National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan.  The CICC will initially act as another subcommittee or Working Group under the auspices of the GAC.  Additional information about Global may be found on the Web at:  http://it.ojp.gov.  OJP requests information from potential offerors as to their capabilities of providing management support to Global and the Designated Federal Official (DFO) including, but not limited to (1) Logistical support:  coordinate site and facility selection, schedule, and announce meetings; provide on-site meeting management; facilitate coordination of public relations needs; provide post-meeting support, including coordinating reimbursement of travel expenses for attendees; assist in coordinating conference calls and other meeting support; ensure notices of GAC meetings, in coordination with DFO, are published in the Federal Register.  (2) Meeting support:  assist in identifying, readying and distributing preparatory documents, meeting materials and presentations as directed by OJP or Global leaders; provide policy research and support to facilitate group discussions as directed by OJP; attend meetings related to GAC, GESC, working groups, subcommittees, and special projects/events; attend annual meetings, coordinated and facilitated as previously stated, as a minimum, two meetings of the GAC and five meetings of the GESC; attend Global Working Group and subcommittee meetings as required by the DFO and GAC Chair, with planning to arrange and provide reimbursements for at least 35 meetings per year with an average attendance of 25 people; coordinate attendance of Global members and/or support staff to at least six conferences and meetings that promote justice information sharing via Global; attend at least six justice integration meetings and conferences to conduct outreach and promote the work of Global in coordination with OJP.  (3) Prepare reports of the GAC, Working Groups and subcommittees; attend and record proceedings; prepare and distribute minutes of all meetings, special projects and events for Global; prepare and distribute, as directed, reports of activities and meetings of Global; provide authoring, editorial and consultant assistance as requested; assist in the authoring of reports by GAC, GESC, Working Groups, subcommittees and special projects and events (may require contacting and involving Subject Matter Experts as needed for specific reports or tasks); assist in outreach activities as directed by OJP; prepare communications and multimedia products to support the goals of the Global Initiative; research, develop and produce informational and multimedia products as needed to highlight the goals and mission of the Global Initiative and improve understanding of Global goals and activities; produce CDs and other marketing materials rapidly while maintaining ability to incorporate changes quickly; support outreach activities to highlight the goals and objectives of Global; plan, develop and support outreach activities in close coordination with members of the GAC and OJP; develop and provide content for Web sites and support Global-related web site(s); work with the Program Office in accordance with Federal guidelines to provide and maintain content, including reports and event notifications for Global-related Web site areas, including affiliated programs such as the Justice Standards Clearinghouse Program and the GJXDM; ensure compliance with applicable rules, and policies, including Federal accessibility standards; ensure ability to restore all content quickly in the event of production system failure; facilitate coordination of multiple groups providing Web site support (Web site must incorporate feedback and content from a variety of sources, including support staff, Web site designers and maintainers, OJP program officials, GAC and Global officials, GTRI (as part of GJXDM), and others as directed by OJP); work with Web site designers as directed by OJP; coordinate regular timely reviews (may be done by conference call) by appropriate personnel to discuss design, content and direction of the Web site; provide semi-annual reports of activities to OJP.  Other expectations and requirements:  The Global Advisory Committee (GAC) operates in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, often referred to as “FACA.”  FACA enumerates to the public the establishment, operating procedures, and responsibilities of federal advisory committees such as the GAC.  Successful applicant must:  be familiar with FACA requirements and be able to ensure that all requirements are met; be prepared to handle GAC meetings as required by FACA; be prepared to handle Working Group meetings as appropriate, in coordination with the DFO and Global leadership; and be prepared to handle the CICC with the guidance of the Program Office and other appropriate entities.  Successful applicant shall demonstrate experience in:  supporting development of national policy recommendations; working with multiple disciplines across all levels, particularly within the criminal justice arena; its record of work that includes Federal, state, local, and tribal-level jurisdictions; its track record of working successfully with a variety of associations, governmental and quasi-governmental organizations, and private vendors; and its track record of team-building.  Due to the range of agencies involved with Global, it is possible that the applicant may support involved agencies.  Any current or potential conflicts of interest should be identified.  The applicant should provide an explanation of how these potential conflicts will be handled internally so as to minimize any appearance or reality of conflict of interest.  Successful applicant must demonstrate its productivity and experience.  Evaluation of applicants will include consideration of successful performance in a similar environment.  Because the performer will be expected to play a significant role in authoring documents, applicants may wish to attach supporting work (portfolio) as an Appendix.  OJP intends to allow submission of requested information for a two-week period.  Upon receipt of the requested information, OJP may schedule one-on-one market research sessions to further explore the state of the marketplace as it relates to the stated objective.  During the one-on-one market research sessions, OJP may request evaluation copies of recommended products.  THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUCED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.  Please include relevant information pursuant to your company’s corporate experience and past performance in this area.  Responses shall be received no later than 2:00 P.M. EST on Tuesday, November 23, 2004 at:  US Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Office of Administration/Acquisition Management Division (OA/AMD), ATTN:  Brenda K.

<RESPDATE>112304
<CONTACT>Contracting Officer - Eva Johnson, Contracting Officer, Ph:(202) 273-8753, Fx:(202) 573-6175
<DESC>This announcement 101-11-05 replaces Announcement 776-04-190 and 776-04-191 previously posted in May 2004. Contractors who submitted capability statements under the previous RFI announcements must re-submit capability statements under this announcement.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Information (OI) Health Systems Design & Development (HSD&D) is seeking industry capability statements for the contract work related to two specific but not mutually exclusive areas of information technology (IT) support.  The specific support areas are VistA Contractor Support (VCS) and VistA Rehosting Support (VRS).  VA is conducting a market survey and analysis of industry capabilities for the follow-on contracts designed to replace the current VistA Contractor Support contracts expiring in March 2005 and for rehosting VistA applications from the current M based programming language to modern technologies.  The contracts will provide for performance measures with incentives and specific socioeconomic goals to include participation by small business firms.  The contractors interested in providing services under VCS will be expected to provide non-personal services relating to specific projects during the life of that project as identified in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW) under the VCS Section A.10.  The contractors interested in providing services under the VRS contract will be expected to provide services relating to specific functional areas for rehosting projects as identified in the attached draft SOW under the VRS Section A.11.  Place of performance shall be designated in each task order.  The VCS project areas outlined in the SOW Section A.10 are not all inclusive, but include: Application Modernization, Common Services, Blood Bank Replacement, CoreFLS (Core Financial and Logistics System), Computerized Patient Medical Records (CPRS), Fee Basis Replacement, Federal Health Information Exchange (FHIE) VA/DoD Support, Health Data Repository, HealtheVet VistA VHA OI HSD&D Support Services, Laboratory Replacement, Patient Financial Services System (PFSS), Pharmacy Reengineering, Registration/Enrollment/Eligibility, Scheduling Replacement, Security Services Support, VistA Imaging, VistA Maintenance.  The VRS functional areas outlined in the SOW Section A.11 are not all inclusive, but include:  System Development and Support, Technical Support, and Requirements Gathering and Support.  The intent is to establish Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with multiple vendors for each specific support area (VCS and VRS).  One set of awards will be awarded utilizing full and open competition and one set will be set-aside for small business concerns.  The government anticipates that resulting task orders issued against the IDIQ will be firm fixed price; some time and material task orders are anticipated. Provide the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code your business falls within.  Included with this Request for Information (RFI) is a draft SOW with specific VCS project descriptions (Section A.10), and VRS functional areas (Section A.11).  Project requirements for section A.10 may consist of but are not limited to software maintenance, application enhancements, development support, requirements gathering, technical support and project management support. In order to determine which projects to set-aside for small business, contractors interested in the VCS contract are requested to submit capability statements addressing their ability to perform all of the project requirements for the projects areas identified in SOW Section A.10.   In order to determine which functional areas to set-aside for small business, contractors interested in the VRS contract are requested to submit capability statements addressing their ability to perform the functional areas identified in SOW Section A.11.  The capability statements are to be in Microsoft Word format (not to exceed 10 pages) and submitted via email no later than November 23, 2004 to SDDContract@med.va.gov and copy to Eva.Johnson@mail.va.gov.  The capability statements shall include Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) by project.  Capability Statements for each project area (Section A.10) or functional area (Section A.11) shall also include a description of similar work performed in the past 5 years inclusive of dollar value and customer.  Contractors shall provide their point(s) of contact name, address, telephone number, and email address; the company's business size, including applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code(s); and Capability Maturity Model for Software level.  This information will be used to develop a bidders list.  The release of a draft request for proposal (RFP) also affords industry an opportunity to comment on any perceived issues with regard to the initiative and to allow the Government to receive the benefit of industry comments.  The Government's purpose in providing an opportunity for industry comment is to identify potential problem areas, and provide alternative recommendations in order to enhance the success of the initiative.  The Government believes industry feedback is important, and is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with the initiative.  Any comments provided should not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific proposal but as an opportunity to improve an eventual solicitation package.  This request for information, or "sources sought", shall not be construed as an RFP.  Information is to be provided on a voluntary basis.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges including postage and shipping will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information.  If you experience any problems or have any questions concerning this announcement, please contact Contracting Officer, Eva Johnson at (202) 273-8753 between the hours of 8:00 am and 4:30 pm ET, Monday through Friday.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, VISN 3 Centralized Acquisition Service, intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with Lumenis. This proposed contract action is for maintenance and repair of a Coherent Medical Aura Yag Laser located in the Ophthalmology Clinic at Northport VAMC for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under the authority of FAR 603.2. The VA believes that Lumenis is the only company that can provide, critical maintenance and repair parts for this equipment. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document is available and telephone or e-mail requests will not be accepted. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 5 days from the date of publication of this announcement. Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements for maintenance and repair of this  Coherent Medical Aura Yag Laser. Information may be sent to Josephine Tuitt, Contract Specialist, VA Medical Center, 130 W. Kingsbridge Road, Bronx, NY 10468. Written responses received will be evaluated, however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the VA Medical Center will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Lumenis. Award period will be 11/22/04-9/30/05 with four (4) option years renewal.

<SUBJECT>A--JPL MOTION SIMULATOR FOR TOUCHDOWN DYNAMICS TESTING REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<SOLNBR>JC-04-05
<RESPDATE>111204
<ARCHDATE>11082005
<CONTACT>Mary Helen  Ruiz, JPL Business Opportunities Office, Phone (818) 354-7532, Fax (818) 393-1746, Email maryhelen.ruiz@jpl.nasa.gov
<DESC>The California Institute of Technology’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Caltech/ JPL), operating under a prime contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), seek responses to this RFI for a Motion Simulator for Touchdown Dynamics Testing. BACKGROUND: JPL, located in Pasadena, California, will be launching a rover to Mars in 2009.  The rover is expected to arrive in 2010 and will be delivered to the Mars surface using a new Entry, Descent and Landing System. The rover will use a rocket powered descent stage to lower the rover safely to the surface directly onto its wheels. The goal of this RFI is to request information to determine industry capability and Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate for the costs to produce a motion simulator for touchdown dynamics testing. Your responses will also help us determine the interest in the motion control community and allow us to refine our requirements and subcontract implementation approach. The following documents are provided as illustrations of JPL specifications: 1. Motion Simulator Specification 2. Exhibit 1 – Touchdown Dynamics Test bed Project Overview and Test bed Objectives This effort is in support of a cost capped activity. As such, JPL is interested in maximizing the performance of the motion simulator per dollar spent on it. In particular JPL is interested in understanding the sensitivity between Z-axis stroke (from as low as 5 meters to a maximum of 8 meters) and cost for a fixed response bandwidth. WE ASK THAT YOU IDENTIFY YOUR PROPOSED TECHNOLOGICAL APPROACH AND COMMENT ON ITS PRINCIPAL PERFORMANCE-COST RELATIONSHIPS. JPL is currently planning to provide a gantry to support the motion simulator (see Figure 8 in Exhibit 1). One of the objectives of this RFI is to understand the extent to which the vendor community is interested in and able to provide their own gantry as part of the eventual contract. The gantry being designed by JPL makes use of existing structural elements for which JPL would like to make the most use of for cost savings purposes. The configuration of the gantry; however, can and will be modified to best meet the needs of the selected motion simulator. PLEASE COMMENT ON THE CURRENT GANTRY CONFIGURATION’S COMPATIBILITY WITH YOUR SYSTEM. The Request for Proposals (RFP) for this effort will be issued sometime during November 2004. We expect to receive and commission the motion simulator approximately five (5) months after the start of the subcontract. QUESTIONS: The vendor is requested to provide written responses to the following: 1.) What experience do you have in building similar motion control projects? 2.) How aggressive is the five-month delivery time for your company?  How much longer, or shorter, would your company recommend JPL allocate for the delivery after start of subcontract? 3.) What changes to the requirements or Statement of Work (SOW) do you suggest to reduce cost or schedule in the procurement? 4.) What is the ROM costs?  Please provide this information for both a Cost type contract as well as a Fixed Price Contract. 5.) Would you be interested in providing your own gantry to support the motion simulator? 6.) Is the current gantry configuration compatible with your motion simulator design approach?  Could you make suggestions in your response on how JPL could modify the configuration to better interface with your system? 7.) What is your estimate of mass for the motion simulator? 8.) Identify your proposed technological approach and comment on its principal performance-cost relationship. 9.) Can you please state if you are a small business? 10.) Would you be interested in submitting a bid once the RFP is issued? DISCLAIMER: It is emphasized that the requested information is for preliminary planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that JPL will solicit you for such a procurement in the future. Neither JPL nor the Government will be responsible for any costs incurred by you in furnishing this information. Prospective contractors are advised that any information provided shall be deemed to be furnished with unlimited rights to JPL, with JPL assuming no liability for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data. RESPONSES DUE: Please submit your expression of interest on or before November 13, 2004, to the undersigned at JPL, Attn: Jean Cheng, Mail Stop 201-203, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA, 91109-8099 or by E-mail: jean.y.cheng@jpl.nasa.gov JPL POINTS OF CONTACT: Please direct technical questions to Fred Serricchio at (818) 354-1076. Questions of an administrative nature should be directed to Jean Cheng at (818) 354-6405 or via E-mail.

Background: To inform effective implementation of the Project BioShield Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-276), ORDC is organizing a public meeting (to take place on or about January 11-12, 2005).

ORDC has the primary responsibility within HHS to enter into contracts with manufacturers for the acquisition of licensable medical countermeasures for the Strategic National Stockpile.   Additional information can be located at the following website http://www.hhs.gov/asphep/ordc/.

<DESC>November 08, 2004 1.0	Description 1.1	The Army Contract Agency, ITEC4, in support of the Joint Tactical Radio (JTR) System (JTRS) Joint Program Office (JPO), is seeking information on how best to acquire a Software Communications Architecture (SCA)-compliant Joint Airborne Network  Tactic al Edge (JAN-TE) waveform application.  This waveform application must satisfy the JAN-TE Functional Design Document (FDD), be compatible with the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW), and be capable of integration onto all aircraft applicable to the Joint A irborne mission.  At this time, the JTRS JPO expects the Multifunction Information Distribution System (MIDS) JTRS to be the lead terminal with the Airborne Maritime & Fixed terminal to follow. 1.2	This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.   1.3	Release of reference technical documentation will be limited to United States corporations and United States citizens.   2.0	Background 2.1	Current trends within both military and commercial communications systems are to move to the concept known as the Software Defined Radio (SDR).  SDRs implement the vast majority of their functions in software.  The SCA defines standards for waveform ap plication implementation in JTR Systems.  The JTRS program is defining the open architecture requirements for the future implementation of military communication systems, including JAN-TE.  JAN-TE is expected to become JTRS-compliant and SCA-certified. 2.2	This RFI addresses design requirements and possible acquisition strategies for the development of a JAN-TE waveform application that meets the requirements articulated in the JAN-TE FDD.  These design requirements and acquisition strategies must consid er platform integration constraints as well as the most current hardware and software development schedules for other JTRS programs. 3.0	Requested Information 3.1	This RFI requests information from industry regarding the JAN-TE design requirements.  It also requests information regarding possible acquisition strategies and an estimated schedule to develop the software waveform and JTR Terminal modifications.  Th e Government prefers a total systems approach, including the waveform application, terminal considerations, platform integration, and Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP). 3.2	The Government requests that industry address the following questions. 3.2.1	Are there any technical solutions, either existing or in development, which could satisfy a portion or all of the JAN-TE requirements described in paragraph 1.1 of this RFI?  Please quantify where possible.  Are there solutions that could be modified  to satisfy these JAN-TE requirements?  If so, explain necessary modifications.  *Note: Although there is no obligation to use the Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT) specification, it is available for review as listed in section 4 of this documen t. 3.2.2	JAN-TE FDD Figure 3-1 identifies the JTRS unit-level networking architecture provided via WNW.  Based upon FDD paragraphs 3.4.4.1 and 3.4.4.2, do you envision JAN-TE to interface the heterogeneous networking core in a manner consistent with the WNW  interface?  If not, what interface is available?  Is a modularized HETNET and MANET layer a prerequisite to a viable solution?  Explain. 3.2.3	What contracting strategy would ensure that the JAN-TE waveform development, the MIDS JTR development, the AMF development, the CLIP development, and platform integration are conducted in a synchronous manner? 3.2.4	Can the JAN-TE waveform be implemented strictly in software (s/w)?  Describe any hardware (h/w) impacts to the baseline MIDS-JTRS and AMF design requirements to implement the software waveform. 3.2.5	How could industry use the HETNET layer to satisfy the JAN-TE requirements? 3.2.6	Do any JAN-TE requirements impose critical c hanges to the JTRS Network Layer (HETNET &/or MANET) as depicted in the JAN-TE FDD? 3.2.7	Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of creating a modularized networking core analogous to the WNW networking core to support JAN-TE. 3.2.8	Describe how network management can be accomplished in light of the requirement that aircraft must be able to operate in autonomous groups with minimal network management workload.  Where do you envision network management being accomplished?  Based on the JAN-TE FDD, is unique network management software or hardware required? 3.2.9	How will the JAN-TE waveform application port across the JTRS Clusters? 3.2.10	Are there any critical issues associated with integrating JAN-TE capabilities onto MIDS-JTRS terminals on tactical edge platforms?  Specifically consider: §	Size, weight, and power (SWP), external avionic busses, cabling, interfaces, & cooling impacts. §	How much output will be required to close links at 100, 200 and 300 nm for threshold and objective network throughputs? §	Does the JAN-TE FDD impose a linear amplifier requirement? §	What type of antenna is required to support JAN-TE requirements? §	Integrating JAN-TE in a MIDS/JTR terminal in order to implement collaborative capabilities (JAN_TE FDD Appendix E  Collaborative Capability Assessment) while minimizing weapon systems platform systems engineering. 3.2.11	Low Latency LOS Transport §	What are the complexity risks in achieving the specified low latency performance in the LOS Service mode?  Rank them relative to level of difficulty/risk in overcoming. §	What level of latency do you believe is achievable at low risk? §	Provide a knee of the curve analysis of latency versus complexity for latencies between 2 ms and 50 ms. 3.2.12	Low Latency LOS Service. §	Do the JAN-TE requirements support independent COI groups? §	How many can it support? §	What are the issues/tradeoffs associated with adding more? 3.2.13	Emission Modes: §	How can JAN-TE achieve the receive-only networking mode requirement? §	How can JAN-TE achieve LPI / LPD mode requirement? 3.2.14	How can JAN-TE perform power management/data rate adaptation? 3.2.15	How can users share network resources? §	What is most effective in achieving collaborative capabilities in JAN-TE FDD Appendix E (Collaborative Capability Assessment)?  Consider JAN-TE achieving network information transport primarily with other JAN-TE enabled tactical platforms and JAN-TE achi eving network information transport primarily with a deployed information transport infrastructure.  §	What type of network resources will be required to achieve collaborative capabilities using JAN-TE 3.2.16	Terrain / Propagation Environment §	Can JAN-TE offer diversity to reduce the impacts of multi-path fading? §	If so, what is the predicted / measured performance? §	Can the diversity level be adaptive? 3.2.17	How can JAN-TE meet the Anti-Jamming Capability required performance at the specified threshold data rate in FDD Table C-1? 3.2.18	Are there any areas/mechanisms where JAN-TE has the potential to interact with Link 16?  How can JAN-TE mitigate adverse interactions with Link 16 negatively? 3.2.19	Will JAN-TE support relative navigation? If so, explain how and to what degree of accuracy. 3.2.20	What latency specifications should be assigned to the JAN-TE crypto?  3.2.21	What data prioritization methods can ensure critical performance requirements will be met in high density environments (latency/throughput)? 3.2.22	What method assures delivery of critical data?  What are the challenges and tradeoffs?  Consider JAN-TE FDD Appendix E (collaborative Capability Assessment) when answering.  3.2.23	The FDD holds out the possibility that the LL-LOS mode may be satisfied by an IP routing solution.  What latency value of the LL-LOS mode would require a non-IP routable solution? 3.2.24	Link 16 has been designated as a sunset system and a legacy waveform.  Please discuss any Link 16 capabilities t hat the JAN-TE FDD does not adequately satisfy. 3.2.25	With respect to frequency spectrum: §	What is the total spectrum (bandwidth) required to support network threshold (10 Mbps) and objective (20 Mbps) throughputs with latencies of (20 Ms) threshold and (10 Ms) objective.? §	What is the channel rate? §	What spectrum (bandwidth) do you envision requiring for the LPI/LPD modes of operation? §	What would enhance the national and international spectrum certification process? 3.2.26	Which requirements would drive cost/schedule for a JAN-TE FDD waveform application development effort? 3.2.27	Are there any changes to the JAN-TE FDD that can positively impact the cost/schedule of a development effort? 4.0	Technical References. 4.1	The Government has the following documentation available for use in formulating responses to this RFI: 4.1.1	JAN-TE FDD. 4.1.2	MIDS JTRS System Segment Specification (SSS) 4.1.3	MIDS JTRS System Segment Interface Control Document (SSICD). 4.1.4	JTRS AMF RFP. 4.1.5	CLIP RFP. 4.1.6	Airborne Network Architecture 4.1.7	Air Force Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Migration Plan (v 1.0) 29 Dec 03. 4.1.8	ASC Acquisition Program Baseline database 4.1.9	Navy Avionics Integration Plan (AIP) 4.1.10	WNW FDD 4.1.11	Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT) Specification 4.2	These technical reference documents may be requested thru the JTRS JPO.
