<CONTACT>Brett E. Bigbee, Contract Officer, Phone (301) 394-3016, Email brett.e.bigbee.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> The explosion of social media and interactive internet services has revolutionized the Information Environment (IE), and fundamentally created a sensor system comprised of billions of citizens observing and reporting activities across the globe. Additionally, global actors, both state and non-state, are using the same interactive internet system to plan and coordinate activities across the spectrum of operations. Essentially, the internet has become a ubiquitous Command and Control (C2) and sensor system that impacts the United States (US) and its allies' missions around the globe, including Shaping activities, force protection, counter-terrorism, counter-Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), and a myriad of others. <br /><br />In response, the Government has established the Secure Unclassified Network (SUNet): an off-Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN), For Official Use Only (FOUO)-accredited unclassified platform to enable the Department of Defense (DoD), US Government Interagency, and Coalition Partners to securely collaborate and share Publicly Available Information, FOUO data, analytics, and other enterprise services. This platform enables mission partners to establish virtual enclaves, control access to those enclaves, and to acquire, develop, and deploy mission-specific data sets and analytics that can be shared across multiple enclaves or restricted based on mission requirements.<br /><br />The objective of this effort is to manage, develop, enhance, integrate, test, deploy, and maintain the SUNet system infrastructure, as well as develop and implement SUNet enclaves for mission-specific requirements utilizing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) products with new data and collaboration features across US Government and foreign partner communities of interest. The Government anticipates the duration of the contract to be five (5) years.<br /><strong><br />PURPOSE:</strong> The intent of this Pre-Solicitation Synopsis is to verify the security clearance information of interested offerors and to develop an "Interested Parties List" to be used in the development of this acquisition.<br /><strong><br />SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:</strong> Security Clearance Eligibility - This notification provides the advanced opportunity for all potential offerors to submit their current clearance information for verification, prior to the official solicitation period. Those offerors who can confirm their eligibility of meeting the security requirements for this effort in advance of the official solicitation release will be eligible to participate in the draft and/or formal solicitation process upon verification. <strong>In order to be eligible to participate in the draft solicitation process, offerors must submit their security clearance information by no later than 15 days after posting of synopsis. All potential offerors' security information must be verified prior to being provided a copy of the draft solicitation, and submitting security information by 15 days after posting of synopsis does not guarantee a potential offeror's participation in the draft solicitation process. In order to participate in the formal solicitation, as well as allow the offeror to take advantage of the full formal solicitation posting time frame, it is strongly recommended that offerors submit their clearance information by no later than 15 days after posting of synopsis to allow for clearance verification to take place in time for the anticipated formal solicitation release date.<br /></strong><br />Offerors must have a valid U.S. facility clearance of Top Secret, Secret storage capability, and have technical personnel with Top Secret/ Special Compartmented Information (SCI) Clearance in order to have access to details under this draft and/or formal solicitation process. In order for this information to be verified, the offeror must provide the following:<br /><br />(1) Company name and address, <br />(2) Contact information for their Facility Security Officer,<br />(3) CAGE code for their Top Secret Facility Clearance, and<br />(4) The name, social security number and email address of one (1) of their Top Secret/Special Compartmented Information (SCI) cleared technical personnel.<br /><br />Due to security clearance verification, responses to this notice are strongly recommended by NLT 15 days after posting of synopsis, at 5:00 PM EST, in order to allow for offerors to take full advantage of the formal solicitation posting time frame. Offerors must provide the required information to Brett Bigbee, Contracting Officer, at brett.e.bigbee.civ@mail.mil. The offeror is encouraged to provide this information in an encrypted zip file using a 256-bit AES encryption (ex. Winzip) and submitting via encrypted email. No phone calls will be accepted as a means to verify clearance. <br /><br />Point of Contact for this notice is Brett Bigbee, Contracting Officer, <a href="mailto:brett.e.bigbee.civ@mail.mil">brett.e.bigbee.civ@mail.mil</a>.

<p>The Sacramento District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has an upcoming project for the renovation of the VA Health Care System Clinic located in Reno, Nevada. The acquisition will proceed using a best-value tradeoff source selection scheme and will result in a design-bid-build, firm-fixed-price construction contract. <br />This project includes the full renovation of approximately 98,400 gross square fee (GSF) of Building 1, by seismically correcting the building, correcting all facility conditions assessment deficiencies and demolishing a portion of the building. In addition, the project will construct an approximate 166,000 GSF clinical expansion to correct space deficiencies. Approximately 50,000 GSF of the Building 1 will be demolished to ensure enough space will be available for the expansion. Upon completion, Building 1 will be transformed into a modern structure supporting healthcare form veterans.<br /><br />The Government anticipates the following challenges (however, there may be other challenges, not listed):<br /><br />1. The constrained site of the Reno campus will create a significant space challenge as there is likely not adequate space on the Reno Medical Center campus for contractor operations such as contractor trailers, subcontractor trailers, staging, parking, laydown areas, and construction traffic patterns.<br /><br />2. Similarly, the Contractor must manage a just-in-time delivery scheme for materials delivered to the work site due to the limited space.<br /><br />3. The VA Reno Medical Center is an active hospital. The successful contractor must comply with various industrial hygiene standards applicable to medical centers to accommodate patient needs while making continuous progress. Work will be occurring adjacent to active patient areas.<br /><br />The site visit/pre-proposal conference date, time and location will be identified in the solicitation.<br /><br />OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELLED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS.<br /><br />Ordering Solicitation: Plans and specification will NOT be provided in hard paper copy or CD format.

As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

The government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14 as follows:<br /><br />By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - Supplies (other than procurement from a non-manufacturer of such supplies). The concern shall perform work for at least 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not including the cost of materials. The Non-Manufacturer Rule is an exception to the LOS performance requirements, and provides that a firm that is not a manufacturer may qualify as a small business on a supply contract set aside for small business if, among other things, it supplies the product of a small business made in the United States.<br /><br />Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government, NOR will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will NOT be individually notified of the results of any government assessments.

The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements.

<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUEST FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force to identify (1) potential sources and, (2) if this effort can be set aside for Small Businesses. While this Sources Sought is for planning purposes only, responses may be used to justify any near-future competitive or noncompetitive acquisition.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought is to notify companies that the U. S. Air Force is seeking potential sources interested in providing all the necessary labor, supervision, equipment, supplies, and materials to inspect, rewind, and repair the stator, rotor, and generator sets of four Westinghouse motors per Statement of Work 14566-18-002. The Statement of Work is provided as a separate attachment to this Sources Sought Synopsis.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various business concerns that might be interested to compete. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in responses from both large and small businesses to include: 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, HUBZone, and Women-Owned Small Business concerns. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized and posted on the FedBizOpps website.

Specifically, the Government has a need for a Secure Intra-Soldier Wireless Module with Reduced Size and Power which will allow U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communications and Electronics Research and Development Engineering Center (CERDEC), Night Vision Electronics Sensors Directorate (NVESD) to address emerging requirements for smaller, lower power Intra-Soldier Wireless (ISW) modules that can support AES-256 bit encryption. The objective of this effort is to demonstrate significant size and power reduction in prototype ISW modules to support integration with dismounted Soldier systems such as the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS). This effort will also address emerging requirements for improved encryption to support certification for Secure but Unclassified (SBU) and Secret and Below (SAB) operation. The products of this effort will enable integration of secure, small, low power ISW modules with existing or developmental sensor systems to provide improved ISW capabilities to the dismounted Soldier. In summary, this effort will deliver prototype ISW modules that can be evaluated against established size, power consumption, and security requirements. NVESD anticipates a single twenty (20) month prototype agreement award to support this program.</p>
<p>Please be aware that the specifications for this program will be For Official Use Only (FOUO). In order to receive information on these specifications, a DD Form 2345 must be approved and on file with the Contracting Specialist, Lena Plummer-Milindez (lena.v.plummer-milindez.civ@mail.mil), to enable receipt of FOUO documents related to this prospective project</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br />United States Department of Agriculture - Forest Service
<p>Tongass National Forest - Alaska <br />Pre-Commercial Thinning<br /><br />Special Notice No.: 19-AK-PCT-RFI</p>
<p>RFI Issue Date: October 16, 2018<br />RFI Response Due: November 29, 2018</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 115310</p>
<p>1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1 The U.S. Forest Service (USFS), Region 10 Alaska in support of the Tongass National Forest is seeking information from interested contractor who are capable of performing the requested pre-commercial thinning work as stated below.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service of any kind. Further, the USFS is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the USFS will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will likely be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (www.fbo.gov). It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this prospective requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background<br />This RFI is for Pre-commercial thinning in Alaska. The purpose of pre-commercial thinning is to reduce stand density, improve forest health and better achieve the potential yield capability of these sites by removing undesirable trees and retaining dominant and codominant trees of the best quality.</p>
<p>2.1 Location<br />While work may be throughout Alaska, the most likely locations for contract award in 2019 are located on Prince of Wales Island and Kuiu Island on the Tongass National Forest in Southeast Alaska.</p>
<p>2.2 Climate<br />Southeast Alaska has a cool and moist maritime climate. This maritime climate results in cool summers, moderate winters, considerable precipitation distributed throughout the year, and a high percentage of overcast days. Precipitation amounts vary widely throughout Southeast Alaska, and annual precipitation of over 100 inches is common.</p>
<p>2.3 Logistics<br />Logistics pose a special challenge on the Tongass National Forest. Gaining access into remote work areas requires considerable planning and research into local conditions. Contractors are advised to learn about the transportation systems of Southeast Alaska. Of special concern are locations that may require a contractor to use small boats to access a work area. Boating can be dangerous any time of year in Southeast Alaska, particularly in the fall, winter and early spring.</p>
<p>The cities of Petersburg, Wrangell, Juneau, Ketchikan and Sitka are all full-service communities and are linked to Seattle, WA via Alaska Airlines. These cities, in addition to the limited-service villages of Kake, Hoonah, and Tenakee Springs, are served by the Alaska Marine Highway System out of Bellingham, WA. Local flight and barge services are also available.</p>
<p>2.4 Access/Remoteness <br />Project area(s) may be remote and not connected to any communities by road. All supplies and equipment to be utilized by the Contractor may need be transported to the work sites by water or by air. The Government does not guarantee vehicle access or continued vehicle access to project areas by road.</p>
<p>2.5 Communication<br />Telephone service may be unavailable on or anywhere near work sites. Having access to reliable communications is essential on the work site. Cell phone coverage in SE Alaska is not consistent.</p>
<p>2.6 Wildlife<br />The wildlife that may be encountered is diverse and can be considered potentially dangerous. Wildlife may include black bears, brown bears, moose, elk, deer, wolves, wolverine etc.</p>
<p>2.7 Terrain<br />The surface of the ground may be extremely broken with some slopes becoming abruptly steep or having rock outcrops and bluffs of various sizes. Wind throw may occur along some sections of the boundary. Brush can be extremely thick in many areas, especially in areas with lower tree stocking. Old logging cable and debris may be present. Tree heights, diameters, and densities vary as site productivity conditions change over the project areas and may also exhibit variable areas of muskeg and thick hemlock and spruce competition.</p>
<p>2.8 Planned Production/Work Description: <br />Due to the fairly steep and rugged terrain and limited access, methods for accomplishing this work are limited to chain saws and hand tools only. The work consists of tree thinning, slash treatment, and related work.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, housing, subsistence, supervision, transportation, operating supplies, and incidentals.</p>
<p>2.8.1 Estimate of 2300 acres for pre-commercial thinning on the Tongass National Forest. It is anticipated that the site(s) will be thinned continuously with no unreasonable time lag in between.</p>
<p>2.9 Anticipated Delivery Period<br />Recommended Contract Time - Subject to industry input<br />Desired Date for Starting Work - Subject to industry input</p>
<p>3.0 Compliance<br />3.1 Service Contract Act (SCA) and Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (CWHSSA)<br />Compliance with the SCA and CWHSSA are material conditions of any awarded contract.</p>
<p>3.2 Section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act<br />Compliance with Section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act is a material condition of any awarded contract.</p>
<p>3.3 Eligibility of Workers. Contractors will be required to provide a completed e-Verify form for each employee prior to receiving a notice to proceed.</p>
<p>3.4 Farm Labor Certificate (FLC): Transportation <br />Transportation of workers is a material condition of any awarded contract as stipulated by the MSPA and as approved by DOL.</p>
<p>3.5 Housing<br />Suitable housing of employees is a meaterial condition of any awarded contract as stipulated by the MSPA and as approved by DOL.<br />3.6 Occupational Health and Safety Act (OSHA) and Safety Plan<br />Contractors are subject to all applicable State and Federal OSHA rules and regulations. Work sites may be remote, and advance planning with regards to safety and emergency evacuation is crucial. Contractors will be required to submit a safety plan.</p>
<p>4.0 Requested Information<br />4.1 According to FAR 15.201(e), RFIs may be used when the Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes. Responses to these notices are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>We request pricing information related to the services as stated and your capabilities to perform the work.</p>
<p>5.0 Responses<br />5.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a capability statement.</p>
<p>5.2 Capability Statements in a common format are due no later than November 29, 2018, 14:00 AST. Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Laurie Moore, Contract Specialist at lauriemoore@fs.fed.us or Mari Meiners, Contracting Officer at mmeiners@fs.fed.us</p>
<p>Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. To aid the Government, please segregate proprietary information. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>
<p>5.3 Section 1 of the capability statement shall provide administrative information, and shall include the following as a minimum:</p>
<p>5.3.1 Name, mailing address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), phone number, fax number, and e-mail of designated point of contact.</p>
<p>5.3.2 Industry recommended contracting strategy including answering the following questions:<br />a. Has your firm ever performed PCT work in Alaska? If yes, please describe.<br />b. How much time after award would your firm need to obtain a crew of eligible employees and be ready to begin work in Southeast Alaska? Explain the process of obtaining employees for this type of work.<br />c. How many acres would be required on a contract in Southeast Alaska to make it economically feasible for your company to be interested in the work?<br />d. Is your firm capable of obtaining or currently have a Farm Labor Certificate?<br />e. What do you see as the biggest challenge for obtaining workers to perform work in Alaska?<br />f. What do you see as the biggest challenges to mobilizing to and working in an area like Kuiu Island?<br />g. Should mobilization and other direct costs be separated from the per acre cost?<br />h. What would be your suggestion on contract type, i.e. Firm Fixed Price/Labor Hour/etc?<br />i. How do you determine your price to ensure workers are paid the required wage?<br />j. Do you pay employees by the acre or the hour?<br />k. Does your firm perform similar work in the commercial market? If yes, What ais the standard commercial terms?<br /><br />5.3.3 Ensure your response includes your DUNS number.</p>
<p>6.0 Industry Discussions<br />Forest Service representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential offerors. Such meetings would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements, especially cost or performance risk involved in this type of work.</p>
<p>7.0 Questions<br />Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing via e-mail to the contact names on this announcement as an inclusion to your response.</p>
<p>8.0 Summary<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY to collect information and identify potential sources that can provide performance of pre-commercial thinning on the Tongass National Forest. The USFS has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<DESC>Request for Expression of Interest <br />Fuel Manufacturing Facility (FMF) and the Zero Power Physics Reactor (ZPPR)Project
<p>1. Introduction<br />Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), Management &amp; Operating Contractor of the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) owned Idaho National Laboratory (INL), is seeking Expressions of Interest (EOI) from prospective offerors to install a roof on the Fuel Manufacturing Facility (FMF) and the Zero Power Physics Reactor (ZPPR) at the Materials &amp; Fuels Complex (MFC) at INL. <br /><br />Estimated cost of construction: $2-3M<br /><br />2. Process<br />BEA is seeking qualified firms to compete for the award of a construction subcontract in support of the FMF and ZPPR Roofs project. Responders to this EOI, based on responses given, may receive a Request for Proposal (RFP) to provide proposals to perform this construction scope.</p>
<p>The purpose of this EOI is to (1) provide advance notice of this RFP which is expected to be issued in January 2019, and (2) seek input on the design of the roof membrane prior to design completion.</p>
<p>3. Project Description<br />The Zero Power Physics Reactor (ZPPR; MFC-775 and 776) roof is a sloped earthen berm covered by a low-permeability membrane. With maintenance needs increasing and performance deteriorating, the membrane is approaching the end of its useful life.</p>
<p>The Fuel Manufacturing Facility (FMF; MFC-704) roof is a sloped earthen berm covered with a 4-inch thick geogrid filled with 1-inch minus gravel. Leaks have begun to enter the FMF, caused by precipitation draining through the earthen cover and entering the facility through cracks in the reinforced concrete ceiling and walls.<br /><br />The overall objective of the project is to prepare the subgrade of the earthen material that forms the top surface of each facility and install a low-permeability membrane over both FMF and ZPPR, then route the runoff from that membrane to the existing MFC surface water management system. This will require cut and fill of existing grade as well as installation of drainage ditches to connect to the existing surface water management system.</p>
<p>The steepness of the ZPPR roof (steeper than 1.5 to 1 horizontal to vertical), and the height (greater than 30 feet), together present a challenge to installing the membrane and ensuring it remains intact for the long-term. The existing structures located beneath the earthen berms are also near their structural capacity; therefore, proposed solutions must either be lightweight or include removing some existing material.<br />This EOI seeks input from constructors regarding the preferred membrane and methods of installation for this application. The input received will be used to complete the design in a manner that optimizes constructability and long-term operations. Responses should include system product data sheets, an estimate of the design life of the system, and a narrative describing the method of installation.</p>
<p>A drawing and photo of the FMF and ZPPR roofs is attached.</p>
<p>4. Non-Mandatory Site Visit <br />BEA will be holding an onsite meeting and tour on Nov. 6, 2018 at 1:30 pm to review the scope of work, unique challenges, and proposed / alternative installation materials and methods. If you plan to attend, please contact the Contract Specialist listed below for additional information regarding site access and the purpose of the site visit. <br /><br />5. Submittal<br />Interested parties are requested to provide expressions of interest (via email) to the undersigned by close-of-business on Nov. 26, 2018. Sufficient written information confirming the responders' qualifications that address each of the following criteria must be included:<br />&bull; Financial and bonding capacity<br />&bull; Safety record: provide Experience Modification Rates and OSHA 300 logs/300A summaries for each of the previous 3 years<br />&bull; Demonstrated experience or expertise with construction regarding this specific type of project.<br />&bull; Demonstrated experience contracting with government agencies<br />&bull; Agreement to become signatory to the INL Site Stabilization Agreement<br />&bull; Capacity to effectively support this project starting spring 2019<br />&bull; Recommended approach to the roofing membrane, including product data sheets, an estimate of the design life of the system, and a narrative describing the method of installation.<br /><br />If you have questions or need additional information, please contact Zachary Bennett, Contract Specialist, at 208-526-0022 or via email at zachary.bennett@inl.gov. Technical questions must be submitted in writing via email.</p>

<SUBJECT>Request for Information: High-throughput Flow System for 96-well Transwell(R) Plate
<SOLNBR>HHS-NIH-NCATS-RFI-2019-0001
<RESPDATE>103118
<CONTACT>Hunter A Tjugum, Contract Specialist, Phone 3018275304, Email hunter.tjugum@nih.gov
<DESC>Description: This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.
<p>Background: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.  The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a translational science center whose mission is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.</p>
<p>The 3-D Tissue Bioprinting Group at NCATS is invested in developing therapeutically relevant three-dimensional tissues for basic research and drug screening. Experts at NCATS are applying the techniques of 3-D printing to develop tissue models that mimic the 3-D structure and organization of cells in the tissues of living organisms. To achieve therapeutic relevance, certain projects must incorporate mechanical cues to create a physiologically relevant cell environment. The incorporation of shear stress is important for vascular projects, as cell function is influenced by mechanical cues, and the Transwell&reg; system is positioned to enable research on many such vascular environments, such as the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>Purpose of Proposed Acquisition: The purpose of this proposed acquisition is to obtain a high-throughput flow system (HTFS) capable of exerting physiological shear stresses on human endothelial cell monolayers that are growing on standard Transwell&reg; inserts in a 96-well plate and cultured with astrocytes on opposites sides of a membrane which mimic a blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>Purpose of this Request for Information: The purpose of this RFI is to acquire information on commercially available systems that can either: (1) satisfy the purpose of the proposed acquisition and meet the below described specifications; or (2) be modified to satisfy the purpose of the proposed acquisition and meet the below described project specifications.</p>
<p>If interested parties do not offer a commercially available system or cannot modify an existing, commercially available system to satisfy the purpose of the proposed acquisition and meet the below described project specifications, those interested parties should still provide a response that describes how their proposed system would satisfy the purpose of the proposed acquisition and meet the below described project specifications.</p>
<p>Requested Information: In response to this RFI, interested parties should provide information on their commercially available system; specifically, how that system can satisfy the purpose of the proposed acquisition and meet the below described project specifications.</p>
<p>Interested parties should indicate whether the existing, commercially available system is of a type customarily used by: (1) the general public; or (2) non-governmental entities for purposes other than governmental purposes, and has been either sold, leased, or licensed to the general public, or offered for sale, lease, or license to the general public.</p>
<p>If modifications to the existing, commercially available system are required to satisfy the purpose of the proposed acquisition and meet the below described project specifications, interested parties should also describe the extent of the modifications, including: (1) whether the modifications are of a type customarily available in the commercial market place; and/or (2) whether the modifications can be considered minor modifications of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace made to meet Federal Government requirements.  Minor modifications mean modifications that do not significantly alter the nongovernmental function or essential physical characteristics of an item or component, or change the purpose of a process.  Factors to be considered in determining whether a modification is minor include the value and size of the modification and the comparative value and size of the final product; as such, interested parties should also describe the value and size of the modification and the comparative value and size of the final product.</p>
<p>Interested parties should also provide the following general information:<br />(1)	Description of organization, including information on staff expertise, availability, and experience;<br />(2)	Description of similar projects completed for both commercial and Government entities;<br />(3)	Suggested NAICS code and Product Service Code;<br />(4)	Preferred contract type (i.e. Fixed Price, Cost-Reimbursement, etc.-see FAR Part 16 for a complete list of contract types);<br />(5)	Manufacturing lead time;<br />(6)	Description of the warranty offered and any service agreements that are either included with the equipment acquisition or offered as a separate acquisition;<br />(7)	Published journal articles or manuscripts in the same or related scientific field;<br />(8)	Brochures and other product literature describing the commercially available item; and<br />(9)	DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g. 8(a), HUBZone, Small Business, etc.).</p>
<p>Project Specifications: The Government is seeking to acquire a HTFS for a standard 96-well plate format that utilizes cone-and-plate shear to create adjustable shear stresses with hemodynamic waveforms in each well.  The system is to be compatible with existing cell culture laboratory incubators, allowing for temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide control.  The system is to contain up to 8 motors, so that shear stress can be controlled independently in groupings of 12 wells within a single plate.</p>
<p>The following project specification are deemed essential to this proposed acquisition.  The system must:<br />(1)	Apply adjustable shear stresses and hemodynamic waveforms to endothelial cell monolayers growing on standard Transwell&reg; inserts in a 96-well place;<br />(2)	Apply shear stress in a manner that does not decrease the viability of cells in the monolayer;<br />(3)	Be compatible with standard 96-well plate format;<br />(4)	Fit into a standard culture incubator, with electronics and hardware reliable for extended (1 week) operation without corrosion or other failure modes;<br />(5)	Control mechanical cues independently between group of 12 wells in a single plate;<br />(6)	Allow for easy access to tissue on both sides of membrane for media changes and imaging during culture period;<br />(7)	Maintain temperature stability in incubator of +/- 1&deg;C;<br />(8)	Produce shear stress control of +/- 2dyn/cm2 estimated from modeling and geometric/motor waveform measurements and spot-checked in the system.</p>
<p>Question/Answer Period: Interested parties are encouraged to submit questions concerning any areas of uncertainty, which, in your opinion, require clarification, correction, or additional information on the RFI. The closing date/time for accepting questions is October 23, 2018 at 4:00 pm Eastern.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE.
<p>This is a Sources Sought Notice which serves as a market research tool to obtain information from industry and will be used for preliminary planning purposes. The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation as a result of this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Sources Sought notice or any follow-up information. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this notice.<br /><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, requests capability statements from qualified Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned SB (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Historically or Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZones), small businesses concerning the potential third high reservoir maintenance and improvements project. <br /><br />Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 237110 (Water and Sewer Line and Related Structures Construction) with a size standard of $36.5 Million. The magnitude of construction is between $1M and $5M. NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.<br />Project Description: Third High Reservoir Maintenance and Improvements, Washington Aqueduct Division, Washington, DC.<br /><br />The Washington Aqueduct provides potable water to approximately one million people in the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia. As part of the water treatment and supply system, the Washington Aqueduct maintains and operates the Dalecarlia and McMillan Water Treatment Plants (WTPs). Potable water from these WTPs is pumped via the third high service to the Third High Reservoir. This reservoir is an approximate 380 LF x 300 LF subsurface structure that is 26 feet deep that was built in mid 1950s. It has a capacity of 21.2 MG and is located adjacent to Fort Reno Park in Washington. DC.<br /><br />The project consists of implement upgrades and improvements to the Third High Reservoir to address operational and sanitary survey issues previously identified. This will result in improved water quality and operation within the distribution system. The work includes architectural, mechanical, electrical and civil improvements to the finished water storage structure that will increase its reliability and improve its function and the replacement of the influent and effluent buildings; the replacement of large valve assemblies; installation of mechanical mixers; sealing of all interior joints and cracks; the re-routing of a sample line and the interception of the reservoir drain line to construct a deep manhole to separate flow from the sewer system by creating an air-gap. This reservoir is a critical component of the distribution system and so the reservoir outage period is restricted. Hence, an experienced contractor with resources and expertise to handle the following project constraints is needed:</p>
<p>i. The reservoir roof surface has limited weight restrictions and can only be taken out of service between the months of November thru March. Hence all work needing to be performed inside the reservoir has to be completed within that time frame. <br />ii. The demolition and re-building of brick buildings must be done within a limited outage window during the winter months when the reservoir is out of service.<br />iii. Access into the reservoir structure is limited and all work therein is considered confined space work.<br />iv. The reservoir is located in a residential neighborhood adjacent to a public park owned by the National Park Service.<br />v. The existing security server and associated equipment is to be removed and re-installed by a professional security contractor.</p>
<p>Interested qualified Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned SB (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZones), or Qualified Section 8(a) certified firms with single bonding capacity to support this project should submit a concise narrative and specific project examples of similar size and scope that demonstrate their specialized experience and technical competence in:</p>
<p>1. The demolition and reconstruction of brick masonry buildings complete with the installation of heating, ventilation, electrical and SCADA equipment.<br />2. Performing expansion and construction joint sealing with active infiltration within a limited and time-constrained outage. <br />3. Successful installation of large valve assemblies and mechanical mixers in confined spaces with trained and certified personnel in a timely manner.<br />4. Excavation construction of large, deep manholes.<br />5. Utility re-route and commissioning.</p>
<p>Capability statements should include information and details of similar projects, to include contract value.</p>
<p>In addition please provide a letter from the surety regarding the potential Small Business General Contractor's maximum bonding capability for a single contract action between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00, and total aggregate bonding capacity.</p>
<p>Narratives shall be no longer than ten pages. Email responses are preferred. <br /><br />The contractor should be familiar with the Federal Safety Manual and provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act.<br /><br />Comments will be shared with the Government and the project design team, but otherwise will be held in strict confidence.<br /><br />Responses must include the Company name, address, phone number and point of contact, SAM information and DUNS Number.</p>

<CONTACT>Kemper Nichole Wood, Acquisition Specialist, Email knwood@fbi.gov
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a sole source, blanket purchase agreement (BPA) contract with Arc3 Gases, Inc., 1636 US-301, Dunn, NC, 28334 for the purpose establishing a blanket purchase agreement for Laboratory gases. The procurement is being conducted under FAR Parts 12 and 13.
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Laboratory Division has a requirement for gases to support its forensic science operations in the main FBI Laboratory Building and the FBI Operational Response Center. Specialized gases are used to operate scientific instruments and perform examinations in many Laboratory Division disciplines, including Chemistry, Explosives, Trace Evidence, Counterterrorism Forensic Science Research, DNA, Chem-Bio-Rad-Nuclear Sciences, and Firearms &amp; Toolmarks. A single type of gas can be used for multiple functions and a single instrument can use multiple types of gases. Some of those gases include, Acetylene, argon (high pressure, liquid, and ultra-high purity), carbon dioxide (research grade), carbon monoxide (research grade), compressed air, helium (high purity and ultra-high purity), hydrogen (research grad), methane (ultra-high purity), nitrogen (gas, liquid, and ultra-high purity), oxygen and ultra-zero air. Gases must be available for routine delivery on a weekly basis and in the event of an emergency, delivery is required within 24 hours.</p>
<p>The Laboratory Division currently utilizes a Perma-Cylinder holding tank for Liquid Argon from Arc3 Gases, Inc. The ability to fill the current tank with up to 1,000 liters of argon is required. Arc3 Gases, Inc. is the only vendor permitted to fill their tanks; therefore they are the only vendor capable of meeting this requirement.</p>
<p>Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that Arc3 Gases, Inc. is the only vendor capable of providing all of the required gases, the number of tanks required and the ability to fill the existing liquid argon tank.</p>
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 325120, Industrial Gas Manufacturing.</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to the attention of: Kemper Wood, email address: knwood@fbi.gov by Monday, October 22, 2018 (12:00 pm Eastern). Emailed responses will only be considered. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information. The EFT banking information on file in SAM will be what the FBI uses to process payment to your organization.</p>

<DESC>The objective of this acquisition is to acquire the services needed to the agency consolidated end-user services (ACES) requirement. The ACES requirement will develop a continued long-term outsourcing arrangement with the commercial sector to provide and manage the vast majority of NASA's personal computing hardware, Agency standard software, mobile IT services, peripherals and accessories, associated end-user services, and supporting infrastructure.<br /><br />The nature of NASA's program implementation model requires extensive cross-Center collaboration, which is vital to the planning, design, and development of mission-related capabilities and technology in the future. NASA, therefore, requires a seamless technical IT infrastructure to ensure interoperability both within programs and across Centers and facilities. The ACES requirement will continue to develop a long-term outsourcing arrangement with the commercial sector to provide and manage the vast majority of NASA's personal computing hardware, Agency standard software, mobile IT services, peripherals and accessories, associated end-user services, and supporting infrastructure. These are the predominant service components of the performance work statement (PWS) necessary to support the ACES requirement throughout NASA headquarters, the ten NASA field centers, and other performance sites.<br /><br />NASA/NSSC intends to issue a sole source contract to Enterprise Services LLC (ES).<br />Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B), it has been determined that only the original source in the case of the follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized services will satisfy agency requirements. Awarding to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement. NASA/NSSC will be the procuring center for this effort.
<p>The Government intends to acquire commercial items and services using the provisions, clauses and procedures prescribed in FAR 12, and FAR Part 13.</p>
<p>Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>
<p>Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is seeking information regarding various ship mounted, marine cranes for the Waterways Commerce Cutter (WCC) program. The USCG has identified several operations that are vital to the WCC's mission capabilities. These operations are detailed below: <br /><br />A. River Buoy Tending <br /><br />The WCC will need to have the capability to perform buoy tending operations which involve moving weights safely and quickly about the working deck of the vessel while it is underway. These weights include concrete blocks weighing up to 1,500 lbs and measuring 34in x 34in x 15in with a steel padeye mounted on one corner as well as on the top of the block. Class 4 cylindrical nun and can buoys weighing 470 lbs and measuring 10.5ft tall with a radius of 30in will also need to be moved. Concrete blocks will typically be stored on deck in stacks 7 sinkers high. Buoys will be stored vertically on deck within a buoy pen. Buoys may also be anchored into muddy bottoms by jetting a small cone anchor into the riverbed with a 40ft jet pipe hung vertically and lowered into the riverbed. <br /><br />B. Pile Driving and Extraction<br /><br />The WCC will need to have the capability to drive 60ft long piles with a diameter of 18in made of wood, steel, concrete, or composite off the bow of the vessel. These piles can weigh up to 3,000 lbs and may be driven into mud, sand, gravel, or rocks. These piles will also need to be extracted from similar environments. Piles requiring extraction may be intact or in various states of damage/decay. Steel piles frequently rust through and break near the waterline, while wood piles are usually damaged from ship contact and may break in a variety of ways. If part of a pile is above the riverbed/seafloor, it will need to be extracted. New piles are typically stored horizontally on the working deck in stacks 4 wide and 4 high. A separate area on the working deck will be designated for wreckage.<br /><br />C. Tower Construction<br /><br />The WCC will install skeleton towers up to 50ft tall on top of platforms rising 17ft above the waterline. Construction of the platform involves driving 4 piles in a square formation, installing bracing between the piles, and installing a flat platform on top of the piles. Pre-assembled towers are then lifted and installed on top of the platform. For additional information on this operation see the attached ATON manual on structures, primarily data sheets 8 and 12.<br /><br />D. Large Buoy Operations<br /><br />The WCC must be able to safely recover and deploy a flooded USCG 6x20 LR buoy weighing 17,000 lbs at a radius of 25ft. It must also be able to recover the buoy's associated 8,500 lb concrete sinker and 1,800 lbs of chain at a similar radius.<br /><br />Questions for Industry<br /><br />The USCG requests that you specifically address the provided questions in the excel attachment. Please feel free to provide comments, questions and/or recommendations as you deem appropriate. Please be aware that the USCG intends to have support contractors review the information submitted. If, in your response, you are submitting proprietary data please contact the Contracting Officer ahead of the response date to ensure nondisclosures can be processed to protect all parties between your company and our support contractors' companies. Please ensure your proprietary data, if submitted, is marked accordingly.<br /><br />Submission<br /><br />Responses to this RFI shall be submitted to Jennifer Sokolower at Jennifer.G.Sokolower@uscg.mil.<br /><br />This special notice is for market research and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a solicitation and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract from responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by interested parties is strictly voluntary and no monetary compensation will be provided for response preparation.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations, the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Note: Page numbers in this document may not be accurate.</p>
<p>All contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.SAM.gov) prior to award of a contract. All proposed contractors are highly encouraged to review FAR Clause 52.232-33 Payments by Electronic Funds Transfer - System for Award Management, which indicates "All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT)." Those not currently registered can obtain registration by going to the website http://www.SAM.gov. The process can usually be completed from 24 to 48 hours after submission. Contractors will need to obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (formerly DUNS number) for processing their registration. If you do not already have a Unique Entity Identifier, one can be obtained from http://www.SAM.gov. Refer to www.SAM.gov for information formerly found in CCR, EPLS, ORCA and FedReg.</p>
<p>Please begin the registration process immediately in order to avoid delay of the contract award should your firm be selected.</p>
<p>ALERT: You must submit a notarized letter appointing the authorized Entity Administrator before your registration will be activated. This requirement now applies to both new and existing entities. Effective 29 April 2018, the notarized letter process is now mandatory on all CURRENT registrants at SAM who have a requirement to update data on their SAM record. The notarized letter is mandatory and is required<br />before the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) will activate the entity's registration.</p>
<p>Effective 29 June 2018, vendors creating or updating their registration can have their registration activated prior to the approval of the required notarized letter. However, the signed copy of the notarized letter must be sent to the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) within 30 days of activation or the vendor risks no longer being active in SAM.</p>
<p>Vendors can check whether an account is active by performing a query by their CAGE or Unique Entity Identifier (known as DUNS). The new registration process may now take several weeks, so vendors are highly encouraged to begin registering as soon as possible to avoid any possible delays in future contract awards. Remember, there is no cost to use SAM. To find out additional information about the changes of the SAM registration process, contractors should visit the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) link located at the top of the SAM homepage (www.sam.gov).</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: SAM is completely free of charge for both registrants and users.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES - Please see Attachment 2 to this solicitation for information on AAPD No. 18-02.</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<br />&emsp;<br />ATTACHMENT 2</p>
<p>Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Chapter 7. <br />USAID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR)</p>
<p>APPENDIX D - DIRECT USAID CONTRACTS WITH A U.S. CITIZEN OR A U.S. RESIDENT ALIEN FOR PERSONAL SERVICES ABROAD</p>
<p>GP 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES (MAY 2018) (Pursuant to class deviation #M/OAA-DEV-AIDAR-18-3c)</p>
<p>USAID will provide Medevac services to the contractor and authorized dependents, through the Department of State's Bureau for Medical Services (MED), similar to those provided to U.S. Government employees in accordance with 16 FAM 300 Medical Travel. Medevac costs include travel and per diem, but do not include medical care costs. To be covered by the Medevac program, the contractor and authorized dependents must obtain and maintain international health insurance coverage that includes overseas hospitalization, and must provide proof of such insurance to the contracting officer prior to relocation abroad.</p>

The Library of Congress (Library) requires contract support to acquire uninterruptable power supplies (UPS) for the Packard Campus of the National Audio Visual Conservation Center (NAVCC).  The Library operates the NAVCC technical plant 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Due to its rural location, the NAVCC suffers power over-voltages, under-voltages and outages several dozen times per year.  The Library uses uninterruptible power supplies to prevent damage to its equipment and to allow for the orderly shutdown of its systems in the event of a total power outage, including both manual and automatic shutdown processes.
<p>This requirement is to acquire three models of APC brand (Brand Name only requirement) UPS' (uninterruptible power supplies), with accompanying AVR functionality, Ethernet network management card and rack mount hardware.  Additionally, the Library has identified a need to acquire multiple extension cords, of at least 10' in length, compatible with the UPS models being acquired.&nbsp; Please see attached solicitation document for full details.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BRAND NAME REQUIREMENT JUSTIFICATION</span></strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This acquisition is a Brand Name requirement (APC brand UPS models only) being pursued under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(c).  APC Brand UPS models are the only brand of UPS' currently known to be fully compatible with the National Audio Visual Conservation Center's (NAVCC) custom-built management network and auto-shutdown scripting system which was designed for its extant APC brand UPS equipment.  The use of any other known brand of UPS models poses an unacceptable risk of damage to NAVCC equipment in the event of power over-voltages, under-voltages and shut downs, which occur several times per year at the facility due to its rural location.  As such, UPS models proposed in response to this solicitation must be APC brand in order to be considered technically acceptable and eligible for award.  Please see attached J&amp;A - Brand Name Justification for full details.</p>
<p>Please note that this solicitation replaces a previously issued solicitation for UPS supplies, 030ADV18Q0467, issued on September 7, 2018, which has been cancelled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quotes may be submitted electronically via e-mail to the Contract Specialist, Jason Williams, at jwillia@loc.gov.&nbsp; Please cite the solicitation number, 030ADV19Q0020 in the e-mail subject heading.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to answer Vendor submitted questions.

QUESTION 1:  Why is this Solicitation not set aside for SDVOSB/VOSB?
38 U.S.C. 8127(d) states that a contracting officer of the VA,  shall award contracts on the basis of competition restricted to small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans if the contracting officer has a reasonable expectation that two or more small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans will submit offers and that the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.   There are 84 SDVOSB/VOSB concerns listed as verified in the Dept. of Veterans Affairs Vendor Information Pages (VIP) https://www.vip.vetbiz.va.gov database under NAICS code 334516. 


ANSWER 1:  The  Rule of Two  analysis showed that there are not enough interested SDVOSB/VOSB or SB manufacturers that responded to our RFI that could fulfill this requirement, and that there are not enough interested SDVOSB/VOSB distributors that have compatible products from two or more SB original equipment manufacturers capable of meeting the requirement.


QUESTION 2:  We would like to know what the RFI number was resulting in the RFQ # 36C10G18Q9143, 66-NX EQ Digital Water Baths Thermo Fisher Scientific Precision Brand Name or Equal.  Also, how many responses were received to the RFI?

ANSWER 2:  The RFI/Sources Sought was posted on FedBizOpps on 18 May under solicitation number 9614. The number of responses is not information we release.

 
QUESTION 3:  Could we please have a copy of the survey questions from the RFI/Sources Sought?

ANSWER 3:  The RFI/Sources Sought was conducted by an outside office on our behalf, so I don t have access to the questions only the summary report. You will need to contact the point of contact which is listed as Jim Burdan at James.Burdan@va.gov.

<p>The Government would like to remind Interested Offerors that the proposal due date for the VB M&amp;R Services Request for Proposal (RFP) is this Friday, 19 Oct 2018, by 4:00 PM EST. Per the RFP's Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 Section 3.2.2, Offerors are reminded to submit their proposal in two formats: one (1) paper (hard) copy submitted to the address listed in Section 3.2.2.1, and an electronic copy submitted to the email addresses listed in Section 3.2.2.2 via AMRDEC SAFE (https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/safe).</p>
<p>Also, in regards to the Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQs) per the Addendum to 52.212-1 Section 5.4.1.1, Offerors are reminded to submit PPQs with Section I completed as part of their proposal submission. Further, "The Offeror shall exert its best efforts to ensure the POCs complete and send the PPQ directly to the Government POC as specified on the last page of the PPQ by the closing date of the solicitation" since "PPQs will not be accepted from Prime Contractors, Subcontractors, or Manufacturers." Therefore, the Offeror's responsibility in regards to PPQs are to submit a copy of the PPQ with Section I completed with their proposal submission, and to exert its best efforts to ensure the effort/contract's POC submits the PPQ to the Government. The RFP does not state that PPQs will not be accepted from the effort/contract's POC after the proposal due date.</p>
<p>Interested Offerors should continue to monitor this FedBizOps posting for updates to the RFP.</p>

<p>The proposed contract shall be a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), MAC IDIQ with a period of performance of one (1) base year with four (4) one-year option periods and one (1) six-month extension in accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.217-8.

See AFFARS Provision 5352.215-9001 within the RFP for details on the pre-proposal conference, to include instructions on information Offerors should submit in order to attend.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this fourth amendment is to provide a response to a question received from Industry:


1. Question:  During the Systems Simulation, Software and Integration (S3I) Industry Day held on 20 SEP 2018 at the Jackson Center, S3I leadership briefed their Proposed Future Contract Strategy for Business Support services in the Business & Analytical or Programmatics Domain using the NAICS Code 541330, Engineering Services.  Will the Government re-consider its acquisition strategy and change the NAICS for this opportunity to 541611?


S3I Response: The NAICS for Business Support services in the Business & Analytical or Programmatics Domain was inadvertently identified as 541330 in lieu of 541611.  The current strategy for Business Support services will be solicited in either the B&A or Programmatic domain of EXPRESS, which carries a NAICS code of 541611.  This is based upon preliminary market research and all future acquisitions will be based upon final definition of the requirements and the results from market research.  The NAICS code for any resultant acquisition is subject to change upon definition of final requirements.

The Columbus VA Ambulatory Care Center located at 420 N. James Road, Columbus, OH 43219 intends to solicit proposal from contractors in the Columbus, Ohio (Franklin County) area to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The VA anticipates issuing a solicitation for this requirement on September 24, 2018, with a closing date for proposals on or about October 26, 2018.  The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.  Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of the solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available. The solicitation will provide full information to prospective offerors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS FOR SPECIALIZED A-E SERVICES
BUREAU OF RECLAMATION


The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Regional Office, has a need for an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for architectural and Engineering Services (A-E), Design Services for the Boise River Basin feasibility study and associated environmental compliance activities. This procurement will result in a single award, IDIQ contract for multi-discipline A-E services in support of feasibility study(ies) to explore potential increased surface water storage opportunities behind Anderson Ranch, Arrowrock, and/or Lucky Peak Dams, which are within the Boise River System in Southwestern Idaho.

The comprehensive scope of the A-E services shall include documented experience, professional registration, and applicable expertise in comparable feasibility studies and associated environmental compliance.  The awarded IDIQ contract base services will include professional A-E services with the ordering period of five years for services from contract award.  The guaranteed minimum for the contract term is $20,000.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to negotiate firm-fixed price task orders under this contract.  However, the Government reserves the right to award other than firm-fixed price task orders if the need arises.  There will be no dollar limit per task order and no dollar limit per year up to a maximum of $4,000,000 for the entire contract term.  Estimated start date is December 2018.

This acquisition is a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The Government will only accept qualifications from small business concerns. All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit qualifications packages. The Small Business size standard classification is North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 541330, Architectural and Engineering Services.  The Government seeks the most highly qualified firm to perform the required services. Selection of this firm will be made in accordance with the below selection criteria. The awarded contract will be subject to specific provisions addressing the avoidance of organizational conflicts of interest, including, WBR 1452.209-80 Organizational Conflicts of Interest.  The prime firm for this contract will be required to perform throughout the contract term.  All contractors are advised that registration in System for Award Management (SAM) Database is required prior to award of a contract.  Failure to register in the SAM Database may render your firm ineligible for award.  For more information, check the SAM Web site: https://www.sam.gov

Interviews may be scheduled with firms that rate as the most highly qualified. Firms selected for participation in interviews may be asked to clarify information contained in the SF-330 submittal. Elaborate presentations are not desired.

Architect and Engineer services that may be required under this contract include but are not limited to: perform public scoping and outreach; perform topographic survey, modeling, and analysis; conduct feasibility-level studies; identify, formulate, and/or develop non-structural alternative(s); develop feasibility-level designs and cost estimates, including related studies, field investigations, surveying and mapping, evaluations, consultations, and conceptual designs; analyze alternatives; perform economic analyses; perform environmental compliance (including preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement, Biological Assessment, supporting documentation for National Historic Preservation Act) and permitting requirements with local, state, and Federal agencies; conduct and assist in project management; perform technical writing; and prepare construction documents.  Details on the required services will be provided in individual work orders.

Through the screening work performed thus far in FY18, a potential raise at Anderson Ranch Dam appears to be the most attractive, so initial task order efforts are focused on Anderson Ranch Dam and Reservoir.  Analysis of alternatives supporting the feasibility study for Anderson Ranch Dam and Reservoir will take approximately six months to complete and must be completed prior to the initiation of formal environmental compliance activities. Pre-Notice of Intent (NOI) environmental compliance activities will be performed in parallel with feasibility determination efforts.  Formal environmental compliance activities associated with an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) shall take no longer than one year from issuance of NOI to finalization of an EIS and Record of Decision (ROD).  Projected high level schedule milestones are as follows:

Dec 2018	Award AE IDIQ and Task Order 1
May 2019	Initiate environmental compliance
June 2019	Complete analysis of alternatives
Nov 2019	Publish Draft EIS
Mar 2020	Publish Final EIS
May 2020	Complete ROD
Jun 2020	Finalize Feasibility Report
Jul 2020	Commence formal Department of the Interior reviews
Aug 31, 2020	PNRO deadline for feasibility determination

The acquisition will proceed using a best-value tradeoff source selection scheme and will result in a design-bid-build, firm-fixed-price construction contract.
<p>This project includes the full renovation of approximately 98,400 gross square fee (GSF) of Building 1, by seismically correcting the building, correcting all facility conditions assessment deficiencies and demolishing a portion of the building. In addition, the project will construct an approximate 166,000 GSF clinical expansion to correct space deficiencies. Approximately 50,000 GSF of the Building 1 will be demolished to ensure enough space will be available for the expansion. Upon completion, Building 1 will be transformed into a modern structure supporting healthcare form veterans.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates the following challenges (however, there may be other challenges, not listed):</p>
<p>1. The constrained site of the Reno campus will create a significant space challenge as there is likely not adequate space on the Reno Medical Center campus for contractor operations such as contractor trailers, subcontractor trailers, staging, parking, laydown areas, and construction traffic patterns.</p>
<p>2. Similarly, the Contractor must manage a just-in-time delivery scheme for materials delivered to the work site due to the limited space.</p>
<p>3. The VA Reno Medical Center is an active hospital. The successful contractor must comply with various industrial hygiene standards applicable to medical centers to accommodate patient needs while making continuous progress. Work will be occurring adjacent to active patient areas.</p>
<p>The site visit/pre-proposal conference date, time and location will be identified in the solicitation.</p>

<AWDDATE>111618
<DESC>The proposed action will be for up to 28,000 Joint Personal Dosimeters - Individual (JPD-IND), conformance testing, and technical data. The JPD-IND is a rugged Radiation Detection, Indication and Computation (RADIAC) Battlefield Dosimeter that replaces legacy radiological dose measurement devices. JPD-IND will provide a joint solution that eliminates parts obsolescence, increases capability, reduces life-cycle costs, and addresses Operation TOMODACHI lessons learned for common, interoperable equipment with adequate sensitivity and common units of measure, replacing the legacy systems, the PDR-75/DT-236 and the PDR-75A/DT-236A series systems. The JPD-IND system is envisioned to include a real-time, self-indicating dosimeter unit with inherent measurement and display capabilities, and to be worn on the wrist or chest. Data transfer is will occur via connectivity to existing situational awareness and mission command systems and tactical networks.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Topic N07-034 sought the development of a standardized and automated approach to acceptance testing for the wide range of complex training systems planned for use in the Navy. The Navy's flight and maintenance training simulators systems were growing in complexity, becoming increasingly dependent on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf Hardware and Software, as well as the successful re-use of software developed from other programs. Despite the advances in development practices and tools, the goals of accelerating the rate at which training systems can be delivered, and accepted, while reducing their costs cannot be met without comparable improvement in the practices and tools for acceptance testing. Training system deficiencies that are not identified and corrected during testing have resulted in reduced performance and training effectiveness.</span></p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION 
 
Auburn Gresham CBOC Lease 

Identification and Description of Action Being Approved: 
Extend the Auburn Gresham Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) lease for one year without competition to allow time to procure new space.  
 
Description of Supplies or Services Required: 
Real property lease extension of six-months for the Auburn Gresham CBOC.  The CBOC is located at 7731 Halsted, Chicago, Illinois and is comprised of 14,387 contiguous rentable square feet (RSF).
 
Identification of Statutory Authority: 
FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 
 
Demonstration that the Acquisition Requires use of the Authority Cited: 
There are four spaces available in the area of consideration that could be configured to AGENCY CBOC specifications.  The incumbent, Saint Leo Residence, LP, is the only Lessor capable of providing space that is currently configured to meet AGENCY specifications for a CBOC.  If the Government contracted with a different Lessor whose space was not built to AGENCY CBOC specifications, it would result in a 5-10 month interruption of patient care while the new space was being built out to AGENCY specifications, thus preventing access to health care by our veterans residing in the Auburn CBOC catchment area.   
 
Description of Efforts to Solicit as Many Offers as Practicable: 
Relocation of the CBOC was contemplated. It was determined that relocation before current lease expiration is not feasible.  The CBOC is located in the most centralized location to serve the greatest number of veterans in the CBOC catchment area.  Changing the area of consideration will result in diminished service to veterans who would have to travel greater distances to receive medical care.  This would present a  barrier to access  and is not in keeping with the AGENCY mission. 
 
Demonstration that the Anticipated Cost will be Fair and Reasonable: 
Based on Market Research and comparison to historic prices, the current lease pricing is well below the average range of ______for AGENCY-configured medical office space.
 
 
 
Description of the Market Survey Conducted: 
Loopnet.com search on September 5, 2018 yielded four potential sites.

Other Facts Supporting the use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: 
  The above referenced market research locations do not include parking.  Currently, there are 53 dedicated AGENCY parking spaces included at the existing location. If the CBOC was moved, additional costs would be required to lease parking and/or Agencylet services.    
 
Cost Benefit Analysis Results (see  P01-S_SS Decision Tool.xls  located in the contract file for calculations):  
       
Cost Benefit Analysis    
  
Gross Aggregate Contract value of Current Location 

Gross Aggregate Contract value of Available Building with lowest rental rate      

Aggregate Cost Savings associated with Staying in Place      

 
List of Sources that Expressed an Interest in the Acquisition: None 
 
Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: 
A new lease is contemplated within the next 12 months. This new lease acquisition will be advertised in both the local Chicago, Illinois newspaper and the Government Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov).  Additionally, local brokers will be contacted to determine then-current market conditions. 
 
Contracting Officers Determination and Certification: 
I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  I have determined that extending this lease is in the best interest of the Government.
