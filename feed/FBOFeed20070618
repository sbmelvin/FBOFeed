<SOLNBR>07WRSS0028
<RESPDATE>070607
<ARCHDATE>06162008
<CONTACT>JEFF CARAVELLI CONTRACTING OFFICER 9162789341     jcaravelli@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act, P.L. 108-494 (the Act), provided for the reallocation of the 1710 - 1755 MHz radio spectrum from governmental to commercial users via a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction of the frequencies within that spectrum, and the establishment of the Spectrum Relocation Fund with the proceeds thereof to assist participating federal agencies in relocating to a different spectrum. The Northern California Seismic Network (NCSN), operated by the Earthquake Hazards Team in Menlo Park, CA, has been operating in the 1710 - 1755 MHz spectrum for twenty-five years.  It serves as a trunk to bring real-time seismic data back to the NCSN offices in Menlo Park, CA from hundreds of monitoring sites in the field.  The NCSN, therefore, largely with funds obtained from the Spectrum Relocation Fund, must relocate to another microwave radio spectrum available to the government.  The USGS has obtained Radio Frequency Authorizations (RFAs) from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in the 1755 - 1850 MHz spectrum. The USGS therefore has a requirement for a single, comprehensive contract to design, install, and tune a replacement microwave radio system in the 1755 - 1850 MHz range.  To fill this requirement, the USGS will release competitive Request for Proposals (RFP) 07WRSS0028 the week of July 9th; the Statement of Work for this effort will be included therein.  For further information prior to July 9th, please contact Jeff Caravelli at (916) 278-9341 or jcaravelli@usgs.gov. Numbered Note 26 applies to this announcement.  NAICS 517310.

<SOLNBR>2006-N-08835
<CONTACT>Sam Jamison, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882921, Fax 7704882777, Email esw2@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will be issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) # 2006-N-08835 as an 8(a) small business set-aside for research to support the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD).  (Additionally, a second RFP # 2006-N-08556 will be issued as a full and open competition with different tasks from this 8(a) small business set-aside RFP. The particulars on the full and open RFP will be provided by separate synopsis.) The RFP reserves the right of CDC to make multiple awards and compete task orders among the awardees.  The term of the awarded contracts will be 10 years, beginning around April 1, 2007.  The RFP will be available in about 30 days only by downloading at this internet site: www.fbo.gov/ . All responsible 8(a) small businesses may submit a proposal for consideration in response to the RFP.  A wage determination has not been requested since the requirement involves meaningful numbers of professional employees as defined in FAR Subpart 22.11.

The mission of NCBDDD is to promote the health of babies, children, and adults, and enhance the potential for full, productive living including:

•	Identifying the causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities
•	Helping children to develop and reach their full potential
•	Promoting health and well-being among people of all ages with disabilities
Activities for which task orders may be issued:
1. Development and Implementation of Training Programs

a.	Training Programs, relevant to the NCBDDD mission, would include development and delivery of Professional Education programs, Public Education Programs, Orientation and Skill-based programs to providers.  

b.	 More specifically, the Contractor shall be required to perform the following types of training activities:

(1)  Develop course curriculum, including training materials, for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

(2) Provide qualified Instructors and/or Facilitators for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

(3)  Secure subject matter experts to use in developing, adapting training materials, or conducting training sessions for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

(4) Develop web-based, CD-ROM, or other electronic based training programs for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

          (5) Adapt existing materials for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

          (6) Develop Educational Packets for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

          (7)  Evaluate materials before broad dissemination (pre-testing)

          (8)  Acquire CME or CEU credits for training programs/materials

          (9)   Develop and implement a plan for promoting the training materials/program

         (10) Develop and implement a plan for evaluating the training materials/program


2,  Scientific Forums

NCBDDD serves as a convener and facilitator to bring many sectors of society together to solve problems related to the mission.  Sectors that NCBDDD routinely interacts with include other government agencies, health care professionals, business/industry, educational professionals, nongovernmental organizations, and advocacy groups interested in specific disease conditions or health topics.  NCBDDD wants to ensure that events/conferences are planned, implemented, and evaluated to achieve purposes that are aligned with its mission.  Scientific Forums on NCBDDD’s topics must involve constituents and scientists who may have  disease conditions and/or disabilities that the Center studies.  This often requires involvement of specialist interpreters (with scientific training) and/or technology aids that are not usual and customary in typical conference logistics contracts. The role of contract holders under this contract is to coordinate the activities surrounding the identification of potential conference/forum attendees and speakers and assisting in the development of topical materials/agendas, etc.

The Conference logistics will not be provided under this contract, but will be provided through vendors holding HHS conference support/event planning Blanket Purchase Agreements. Conference logistical support includes managing of events and meeting logistics including inviting participants and managing registration, travel, etc.; arranging for audio-visual and other special equipment, facilities arrangements including set up, back drop, sound systems, etc.

3. Preparation of Health Education Products

a.	The Contractor shall provide support for the preparation and production of materials as specified in individual task orders.  Support for any given item may range from simply typing and editing recorded, handwritten or draft-type materials to conducting all stages of development, including research, original writing, and design.  Capabilities to produce camera-ready copies and presentation slides of materials will be necessary.

b.	Because some tasks will require the collection of large amounts of information and user-friendly access to that information once collected, some initiatives may require development of small databases.  Both paper (camera-ready) copy and computer diskette files shall be made available for all documents in the format and computer program specified in the task order.  Examples of specific types of materials required by the Government may include meeting minutes and reports, guidance documents, policy reports, manuscripts, and other documents.

4. Services in the Planning and Development of Workshop, Conference and Other Presentations

The Contractor shall provide support services in organizing NCBDDD sponsored meetings, workshops, conferences, and other presentations as specified in individual task orders.

Services may include working with partners and/ or providers to develop curricula and materials, locating and arranging for qualified instructors, coordinating and providing exhibit materials, securing audio visual equipment, securing sign language interpreters and TDDY equipment for hearing impaired attendees; making other necessary accommodation for visually and physically impaired attendees,  etc., when required by the task order.  Conference logistics will be provided by others.

<DESC>The U.S. Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Peru intends to seek proposals from qualified U.S. organizations interested in providing services to promote sustainable licit development in the communities and regions affected by illicit coca cultivation in Peru.  The Promoting Integrated Development activity will be the principal mechanism in the USAID/Peru Alternative Development Program (ADP) over the 2008-2012 period.  The goals are to:  1)  assist significant numbers of new communities and families to transition to a licit lifestyle after programmed eradication; 2) ensure the sustainability of the licit development gains that have been made to date and commitment to licit lifestyles in the 800 communities of the 2002-2006 voluntary eradication program by consolidating those gains; and, if circumstances necessitate, 3) enroll a limited number of new communities and families into the ongoing program after voluntary eradication of their coca.  The primary focus of the activity will be post-programmed eradication alternative development, with a somewhat lower level of investment of resources on consolidating the gains of the current program.

USAID plans to award a cost reimbursement completion-type contract with a total estimated cost estimated of $75 to $80 million covering a total estimated period of five years:  a three (3) years base period and two (2) one-year option periods.   Revealing the estimated range for the contract does not mean that Offerors should necessarily strive to meet the maximum amount estimated.  Offerors must propose costs that they believe are realistic and reasonable for the work. Cost proposals will be evaluated as part of a best value determination for contract award, including cost effective approaches to achieving the results.

This is a full and open competition, under which any type of U.S. organization (large or small commercial [for profit] firms, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations) is eligible to compete. The procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.  It should be understood that this is a follow-on activity to the Participatory Alternative Development activity that is currently being implemented by Chemonics International under a cost-reimbursement award-fee type contract that expires on March 31, 2008.  The incumbent is not eliminated from this competition.

Offerors are advised that funds are not yet available for award at this time and that contract award is also subject to the approval of Mission Operational Plans.  This solicitation in no way obligates USAID to award a contract, nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers, if such action is considered to be in the best interest of the Government.

All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package that will be posted at www.fedbizopps.gov, on or about March 30, 2007.  Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement.  Telephonic requests or inquiries pertaining to details regarding this RFP will not be taken.  Responses to this RFP will be due approximately 45 days after release of the formal solicitation.

<DESC>The solicitation number is FA8601-07-T-0051.  The proposed contract is for the purchase of elastic-viscoelastic material response research which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1.  The proposed source is Dr. George Voyiadjis.  The service being purchased is as follows: to investigate the damage of material under high energy impact considering wear. The relations developed will be based upon the incorporation of the conservation equations with the first and second laws of thermodynamics.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to the National Council of LA RAZA, 1126 16th St. NW, Washington, DC 20036.  This purchase is to provide recruitment of 350 study participants, complete study activities with each participant, then to give an evaluation on the effectiveness of the National Council of LA RAZA?s Institute for Hispanic Healths (NCLR-IHH) culturally-appropriate lay health educator training module. 

This is a continuation of a research project that began in 2005 as a collaboration between the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) the Office of Rare Diseases (ORD), the National Council of LA RAZA?s (NCLR) Institute for Hispanic Health (IHH). The purpose of the research project was to test the effectiveness of community based lay health educators in promoting increased awareness among low income Latinos about the link between genetics and health.  Through the use of focus groups a culturally sensitive training module and other educational materials were developed and tested in select cities.  In 2006 the Communication Research Section of NHGRI?s Social and Behavioral Research Branch funded a subcontract to examine the project from from a health communication research perspective.  With 150 participants already enrolled in the study NHGRI and NCLR-IHH are now proposing to increase  recruitment and widen the study for increased statistical analysis.  The vendor would provide data collection of implementation data from various sites, collect data from participant questionnaires, Evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, compare results from two educational programs, compare cross-site results, and identify key findings and lessons learned. The vendor will also provide a total of 20 Charas(small community educational sessions) with the 350 study participants, expand and strengthen the evaluation protocol, and provide implementation data reports from each site.  The period of performance will be from July 1, 2007 through September 30, 2008.

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that this study is an expansion of an existing collaboration between NHGRI and NCLR-IHH, to research, design, and develop a culturally-appropriate genetics education tool for use with the Spanish speaking immigrants in a community setting. The pilot project began in 2005 and the initial recruitment phase began in 2006. The results were so promising they are now seeking to expand the program further.  The genetics education program under study is unique to NCLR-IHH and they are the leading advocacy organization for Hispanic health issues.  For NHGRI to continue with this collaboration effort would allow for unparalleled access to a unique population of immigrants that are not usually included in genetics education research, thus providing a valuable federal resource.  An award to any other source would affect the Institutes anticipated outcome and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.  It would also require repeating the production of educational tools, recruitment of study participants and jeopardize the relationships already established with existing participants. 

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the Size Standard is $11.5M.  The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR part 6, Competition Requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Toxicology and Environmental Information Program (TEHIP) to license the DeLima Associates' Dietary Supplements Online Database (DSOL) on a sole source basis from DeLima Associates, 1227 Providence Terrace, Suite L2, McLean, VA  22101-2648.  The Dietary Supplements Online Database (DSOL) is a proprietary database which includes information on approximately 1,000 new product supplements and 1,000 product updates. 

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541511 and the business size standard is $23.0.  This is a 100% small business set-aside.  NLM anticipates that award will be made on or about July 2, 2007.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE
The period of performance shall be twelve (12) months from date of award with three (3) one year options.

BACKGROUND
The primary mission of TEHIP is to provide core information resources and services, facilitate access to national and international information resources, and strengthen the infrastructure for toxicology and health information. In support of this mission, the Program makes available on the web a suite of databases containing both factual and bibliographic information on environmental and health topics.

The advent of the web technology made it possible for TEHIP to extend the reach of its existing databases by hyperlinking to other health information resources in and outside of the government. Moreover, the web technology helped to make its information resources easily available not only to its traditional users such as toxicologists, industrial hygienists, healthcare providers, and regulatory specialists, but also to the public at large seeking information about health effects. 

The unprecedented consumer interest in nutrition, the limited governmental oversight and regulation of the supplement industry, and the potential impacts of supplement use on health care costs have caused government and academic scientists to examine closely the patterns of supplement use and their health consequences. Through surveys, researchers attempt to draw conclusions regarding the nutritional status of populations and the significance of supplement intake in relation to total diet or disease risk. One hurdle researchers face is lack of complete knowledge of ingredients in supplement brands used by consumers. DeLima Associates? DSOL database allows researchers to identify ingredients of specific products (by brand name) and determine nutrient intakes from specific dietary supplements.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION
Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302, DeLima Associates is the only known source that is capable of fulfilling this requirement.  In order for TEHIP to further their mission the capabilities provided by the DSOL database is needed.  The DSOL database developed by DeLima Associates is the only commercially available dietary supplement database approved by CDC under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. NLM's Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP) has received and evaluated the demonstration version of this CDC-approved database. Based on TEHIP's evaluation of the demonstration version of the database NLM determined that this database would be a valuable addition to its current suite of databases containing health effects information for consumers, health professionals and researchers. Following this determination, NLM developed a front-end, web-search application for the DSOL database. Currently, NLM has obtained 1,000 products from DeLima Associates and has put the application through vigorous testing to prepare for release. Prior to release, NLM wishes to obtain additional new product supplement information for the database and updates for current product information.

DeLima Associates'DSOL Database is a relational database that contains product information for approximately 2,000 individual brands of dietary supplements, including brand name, form, active and inactive ingredients, amount of active ingredient/unit, suggested dose, health claims, warnings, percentage Daily Value, universal product code (UPC), manufacturer/distributor information, and other label information. Information is provided for vitamins, minerals, botanicals, amino acids, energy/weight loss and specialty supplements. Also included in the database is manufacturer contact information and product testing results, when available. The DSOL database has a user-friendly, front-end application for researchers that will search the database by brand name, manufacturer/distributor name, active ingredient, and keyword.

This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.  However, if any interested party believes it has the capability to fulfill the above requirement; it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NLM to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 3:00 PM EDT July 2, 2007.   Faxed capability statements are NOT authorized.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Robin Hope-Williams at rhwilli@mail.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.   In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

<DESC>NAICS Code: 325998   NAICS Code: 334519 The EPA/ORIA/R&IE Center for Environmental Restoration, Monitoring, & Emergency Response (CERMER) under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to  Ludlum Instruments, Inc. of Sweetwater, TX for 35 M19 Portable Micro-R Meter (Part #48-1615).  The meters are used for low level Micro R gamma survey.  The justification for a sole source purchase order is as follows. ORIA/R&IE needs specialized detection equipment to be used during the deployment  of the RadNet-Deployable National Radiological Monitoring Stations, as R&IE is tasked with supplying field instruments to deployment personnel operating the RadNet-DNRMS.  The handheld detection equipment will be used to determine ambient background reading specific to radiation detection,  specifically, gamma ambient radiation, prior to setting up a deployable unit. The consistency of this handheld equipment and familiarization between agencies is vital to an effective operation.  Personnel in the field must be able to competently operate the equipment, to repair the equipment, and  to have coordinated usage between field operators.  In the twenty years that R&IE has depended upon Ludlum instruments, R&IE has developed a familiarization with the equipment that has become the basis for internal standard operating procedures, allowing for consistent training of staff and uniform  maintenance - a uniform maintenance which relies upon interchangeable Ludlum parts already in R&IE?s inventory and calibration contracts currently in place.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may  submit a response, which if received within two days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the contracting specialist at daniels.ryan@epa.gov

<CONTACT>Kari Cozzens Contract Specialist 512-326-6494
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION Claims Processing Assistance Tools There is no solicitation document available at this time.  All documentation should be submitted electronically to kari.cozzens@va.gov or via fax at 512-326-6028 no later than 3 pm CST on July 2, 2007. FAR 52.215-3 Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct&#160;1997)  (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection&#160;31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  (b) Although "proposal" and "offer" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.  (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of: Business Rules Engine (BRE) and Business Rules Management System (BRMS) solutions.    (End of provision)  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is conducting market research for businesses that provide decision assistance tools, such as BREs, BRMS, evidence organizing tools, etc.  The objective is to increase accuracy, productivity, and consistency in claims processing.  The business process for adjudicating VA claims is derived from VA statute (Title 38 United States Code), VA regulations (Title 38 Code of Federal Regulations), and business line promulgated procedures.  VA is researching the use of computer- assisted decision support to enhance VBA claims processing efficiency.  The tools must be compatible with web-based Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).   VBA has five business lines that adjudicate claims submitted by veterans and eligible dependents seeking entitlement to various VA benefits.  VA anticipates that implementation will occur in incremental phases via a web-based SOA to 57 regional offices and pension maintenance centers (PMCs).  The VBA five business lines within these regional offices and PMCs are:  Compensation and Pension (C&amp;P) (approximately 10,000 users) (http://www.vba.va.gov/bln/21/index.htm); Education (approximately 1,000 users) (http://www.gibill.va.gov/); Loan Guaranty (approximately 1,000 users) (http://www.homeloans.va.gov/);  Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (approximately 1,200 users) (http://www.vba.va.gov/bln/vre/index.htm); and  Insurance  (approximately 500 users) (http://www.insurance.va.gov/miscellaneous/index.htm).   Interested parties shall submit a capability statement for a decision support solution, company name, point of contact, address, DUNS number, and a brief company background.  It is requested that sufficient information be provided to allow evaluation of the proposed solution to support the Government in execution of its mission for benefits delivery as currently codified in law and regulation.  Please include a list-pricing model based on the information provided herein, for a minimum of 500 users.  Include the cost of maintenance, and a list of available resellers, if applicable.  If the company has any current Government contracts (i.e. GSA, DOD, NASA SEWP, etc.), please list them as well.  In addition, please provide responses to the following questions: 1.  How does the solution capture claims processing rules and procedures from an existing system? 2.  How are business rules and procedures changed, modified, and administered with the solution?  Does maintenance require a software developer, or other administrator? Please explain. Can a business analyst administer the solution? 3.  Is the performance of the solution scalable for high volume online use?  For example, approximately 10,000 users located at 57 different regional offices and PMCs in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines.   How does the solution interface with other technologies?  Specifically the solution will need to interface with VBA systems that support the delivery of benefits for the five VBA business lines.  Can the solution include scripting and changes to code in order to interface with VBA systems? 5. How does your solution support users with differing skill sets and with differing needs, e.g., (1) claims processing professionals; (2) veterans attempting self-service; and (3) call center operations?  6. What advanced inference features does the solution provide? 7. Describe proposed solution repository and how it works to improve claims processing. 8. Can the company provide a turnkey solution (from analysis to implementation)? For BREs, please respond to 9, 10 and 11: 9.  Is there support for:	 - 	Recursive rules? -	Object and rule inheritance support?  (Firing one rule allows a family of related rules to fire.) - 	Multiple inference engine support?  (Internal / external.) - 	Other?   10.  What rule management features does your BRE have? 	-  Rule extensibility? 	-  Rule change administration and impact analysis? 	-  Rule versioning for firing rules for specific date ranges, in the past and future? 	-  Rule release versioning? 	-  Rule security? 	-  Audit report capability? 10.  What "out-of-the-box" rules packaging does the BRE have?

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The objective of the proposed work is to collect demographic, revenue, variable and fixed cost, capital investment and other auxillary information on small scale hook and line, net, and dive fishing fleets operating in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  The proposed data collection will assist in establishing socio-economic baselines, assessing the financial and economic performance of the industry and developing economic models to evaluate management proposals.  The SEFSC anticipates the need to collect at least 150 voluntary, in-person interviews, but would like to purchase a greater number of interviews depending on the overall cost of the contract.  Therefore, proposals must identify the number of surveys that the contractor would be willing and able to conduct at various funding levels.  Cost estimates for 150, 200, 250, 300 and 350 surveys will be required.  Pretested surveys will not count towards the survey quota. The following components are part of the project:  Research Design and Methodology; Pre-testing of Questionnaire, Fieldwork, Database design, data entry and quality control; Report writing and production.  The deliverables are:  a) An interim report detailing the outcomes of project components I (research design and methodology and II (pre-testing of questionnaires);  b) A second interim report upon completion of 50% of project component III to describe progress during the data collection, including problems encountered and solutions; c) A third interim report at the conclusion of the project component III to describe progress during the data collection, including problems encountered and solutions;  d)  a final report to describe work performed throughout the course of the project; and e) the final database and completed interview forms.  Datasets shall be dBase or similar database software.  The evaluation criteria include, but is not limited to:  1) Knowledge and experience designing and implementing surveys; 2) Demonstrated ability to interview hard-to-find and reluctant respondents, such as agricultural workers and fishermen;  3) Detailed working plan, which describes resource allocation for various tasks, non-response mitigation strategies, and demonstrated ability to complete projects in a timely manner;  4) Previous surveying experience in the Caribbean, preferably in Puerto Rico.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for procurement of Precise Biometrics' Biometric and Smart Card Readers on a brand name only basis. The State Department PKI program uses Precise Biometrics' Precise 100MC hardware (smartcard and biometrics fingerprint readers).  Precise certified biometric readers are part of a PKI system, which consists of Entrust software suite, SafeNet smart cards, SafeNet Cryptographic Interface Provider (CIP) middleware, and Precise readers.  Interoperability of the components is essential to a functional system; components not certified by Precise may prove non-functional in this configuration.  As such, there is no guarantee that other readers will support the PKI/BLADE configuration. IRM/OPS/ITI/SI requires Precise 100MC readers to be procured on a brand name only basis.  Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 (c), is cited at the statutory authority.<BR><BR>

<CONTACT>Sam Jamison, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882921, Fax 7704882777, Email esw2@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will be issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) # 2006-N-08835 as an 8(a) small business set-aside for research to support the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD).  (Additionally, a second RFP # 2006-N-08556 will be issued as a full and open competition with different tasks from this 8(a) small business set-aside RFP. The particulars on the full and open RFP will be provided by separate synopsis.) The RFP reserves the right of CDC to make multiple awards and compete task orders among the awardees.  The term of the awarded contracts will be 10 years, beginning around April 1, 2007.  The RFP will be available in about 30 days only by downloading at this internet site: www.fbo.gov/ . All responsible 8(a) small businesses may submit a proposal for consideration in response to the RFP.  A wage determination has not been requested since the requirement involves meaningful numbers of professional employees as defined in FAR Subpart 22.11.

The mission of NCBDDD is to promote the health of babies, children, and adults, and enhance the potential for full, productive living including:

•	Identifying the causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities
•	Helping children to develop and reach their full potential
•	Promoting health and well-being among people of all ages with disabilities
Activities for which task orders may be issued:
1. Development and Implementation of Training Programs

a.	Training Programs, relevant to the NCBDDD mission, would include development and delivery of Professional Education programs, Public Education Programs, Orientation and Skill-based programs to providers.  

b.	 More specifically, the Contractor shall be required to perform the following types of training activities:

(1)  Develop course curriculum, including training materials, for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

(2) Provide qualified Instructors and/or Facilitators for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

(3)  Secure subject matter experts to use in developing, adapting training materials, or conducting training sessions for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

(4) Develop web-based, CD-ROM, or other electronic based training programs for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

          (5) Adapt existing materials for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

          (6) Develop Educational Packets for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

          (7)  Evaluate materials before broad dissemination (pre-testing)

          (8)  Acquire CME or CEU credits for training programs/materials

          (9)   Develop and implement a plan for promoting the training materials/program

         (10) Develop and implement a plan for evaluating the training materials/program


2,  Scientific Forums

NCBDDD serves as a convener and facilitator to bring many sectors of society together to solve problems related to the mission.  Sectors that NCBDDD routinely interacts with include other government agencies, health care professionals, business/industry, educational professionals, nongovernmental organizations, and advocacy groups interested in specific disease conditions or health topics.  NCBDDD wants to ensure that events/conferences are planned, implemented, and evaluated to achieve purposes that are aligned with its mission.  Scientific Forums on NCBDDD’s topics must involve constituents and scientists who may have  disease conditions and/or disabilities that the Center studies.  This often requires involvement of specialist interpreters (with scientific training) and/or technology aids that are not usual and customary in typical conference logistics contracts. The role of contract holders under this contract is to coordinate the activities surrounding the identification of potential conference/forum attendees and speakers and assisting in the development of topical materials/agendas, etc.

The Conference logistics will not be provided under this contract, but will be provided through vendors holding HHS conference support/event planning Blanket Purchase Agreements. Conference logistical support includes managing of events and meeting logistics including inviting participants and managing registration, travel, etc.; arranging for audio-visual and other special equipment, facilities arrangements including set up, back drop, sound systems, etc.

3. Preparation of Health Education Products

a.	The Contractor shall provide support for the preparation and production of materials as specified in individual task orders.  Support for any given item may range from simply typing and editing recorded, handwritten or draft-type materials to conducting all stages of development, including research, original writing, and design.  Capabilities to produce camera-ready copies and presentation slides of materials will be necessary.

b.	Because some tasks will require the collection of large amounts of information and user-friendly access to that information once collected, some initiatives may require development of small databases.  Both paper (camera-ready) copy and computer diskette files shall be made available for all documents in the format and computer program specified in the task order.  Examples of specific types of materials required by the Government may include meeting minutes and reports, guidance documents, policy reports, manuscripts, and other documents.

4. Services in the Planning and Development of Workshop, Conference and Other Presentations

The Contractor shall provide support services in organizing NCBDDD sponsored meetings, workshops, conferences, and other presentations as specified in individual task orders.

Services may include working with partners and/ or providers to develop curricula and materials, locating and arranging for qualified instructors, coordinating and providing exhibit materials, securing audio visual equipment, securing sign language interpreters and TDDY equipment for hearing impaired attendees; making other necessary accommodation for visually and physically impaired attendees,  etc., when required by the task order.  Conference logistics will be provided by others.
The National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD) has been accomplishing the statement of work by utilizing task orders competed between the following contracts:  200-2002-00573 Battelle, 200-2002-00574 MACRO, 200-2002-00575 RTI, and 200-2002-00576 SAIC.

Sectors that NCBDDD routinely interacts with include other government agencies, health care professionals, business/industry, educational professionals, nongovernmental organizations, and advocacy groups interested in specific disease conditions or health topics.  NCBDDD wants to ensure that events/conferences are planned, implemented, and evaluated to achieve purposes that are aligned with its mission.  Scientific Forums on NCBDDD’s topics must involve constituents and scientists who may have  disease conditions and/or disabilities that the Center studies.  This often requires involvement of specialist interpreters (with scientific training) and/or technology aids that are not usual and customary in typical conference logistics contracts. The role of contract holders under this contract is to coordinate the activities surrounding the identification of potential conference/forum attendees and speakers and assisting in the development of topical materials/agendas, etc.

The Conference logistics will not be provided under this contract, but will be provided through vendors holding HHS conference support/event planning Blanket Purchase Agreements. Conference logistical support includes managing of events and meeting logistics including inviting participants and managing registration, travel, etc.; arranging for audio-visual and other special equipment, facilities arrangements including set up, back drop, sound systems, etc.

3. Preparation of Health Education Products

a.	The Contractor shall provide support for the preparation and production of materials as specified in individual task orders.  Support for any given item may range from simply typing and editing recorded, handwritten or draft-type materials to conducting all stages of development, including research, original writing, and design.  Capabilities to produce camera-ready copies and presentation slides of materials will be necessary.

b.	Because some tasks will require the collection of large amounts of information and user-friendly access to that information once collected, some initiatives may require development of small databases.  Both paper (camera-ready) copy and computer diskette files shall be made available for all documents in the format and computer program specified in the task order.  Examples of specific types of materials required by the Government may include meeting minutes and reports, guidance documents, policy reports, manuscripts, and other documents.

4. Services in the Planning and Development of Workshop, Conference and Other Presentations

The Contractor shall provide support services in organizing NCBDDD sponsored meetings, workshops, conferences, and other presentations as specified in individual task orders.

Services may include working with partners and/ or providers to develop curricula and materials, locating and arranging for qualified instructors, coordinating and providing exhibit materials, securing audio visual equipment, securing sign language interpreters and TDDY equipment for hearing impaired attendees; making other necessary accommodation for visually and physically impaired attendees,  etc., when required by the task order.  Conference logistics will be provided by others.There are no contracts awarded specifically for NCBDDD. The NCBDDD has been accomplishing the statement of work by utilizing task orders competed between the following contracts:     200-2002-00573 Battelle, 200-2002-00574 MACRO, 200-2002-00575 RTI, and 200-2002-00576 SAIC. These contracts were awarded for a different Center before the NCBDDD was created.

<DESC>The U.S. Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Peru intends to seek proposals from qualified U.S. organizations interested in providing services to promote sustainable licit development in the communities and regions affected by illicit coca cultivation in Peru.  The Promoting Integrated Development activity will be the principal mechanism in the USAID/Peru Alternative Development Program (ADP) over the 2008-2012 period.  The goals are to:  1)  assist significant numbers of new communities and families to transition to a licit lifestyle after programmed eradication; 2) ensure the sustainability of the licit development gains that have been made to date and commitment to licit lifestyles in the 800 communities of the 2002-2006 voluntary eradication program by consolidating those gains; and, if circumstances necessitate, 3) enroll a limited number of new communities and families into the ongoing program after voluntary eradication of their coca.  The primary focus of the activity will be post-programmed eradication alternative development, with a somewhat lower level of investment of resources on consolidating the gains of the current program.

USAID plans to award a cost reimbursement completion-type contract with a total estimated cost estimated of $75 to $80 million covering a total estimated period of five years:  a three (3) years base period and two (2) one-year option periods.   Revealing the estimated range for the contract does not mean that Offerors should necessarily strive to meet the maximum amount estimated.  Offerors must propose costs that they believe are realistic and reasonable for the work. Cost proposals will be evaluated as part of a best value determination for contract award, including cost effective approaches to achieving the results.

This is a full and open competition, under which any type of U.S. organization (large or small commercial [for profit] firms, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations) is eligible to compete. The procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.  It should be understood that this is a follow-on activity to the Participatory Alternative Development activity that is currently being implemented by Chemonics International under a cost-reimbursement award-fee type contract that expires on March 31, 2008.  The incumbent is not eliminated from this competition.

Offerors are advised that funds are not yet available for award at this time and that contract award is also subject to the approval of Mission Operational Plans.  This solicitation in no way obligates USAID to award a contract, nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers, if such action is considered to be in the best interest of the Government.

All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package that will be posted at www.fedbizopps.gov, on or about March 30, 2007.  Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement.  Telephonic requests or inquiries pertaining to details regarding this RFP will not be taken.  Responses to this RFP will be due approximately 45 days after release of the formal solicitation.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Multi Function Aiming Device
<SOLNBR>MFAD0001
<RESPDATE>062207
<ARCHDATE>07072007
<CONTACT>Richard Boast, Contracting Officer, Phone 813-826-7975, Fax 813-826-7504, Email richard.boast@socom.mil
<DESC>Background

This is a market survey to locate potential sources for the development of a Multi-Function Aiming Device.  The United States Special Operations (USSOCOM) is attempting to improve the effectiveness of their soldiers by developing a fully integrated Multi-Function Aiming Device (MFAD) for engaging targets in close quarters combat.  

Combat operations require the soldier to accurately engage enemy personnel targets in Military Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUNT) environments at ranges of 200 meters and closer.  These close quarter battle operations may require the soldier to clear buildings with multiple rooms over extended periods of time.  Reducing the weight of ancillary equipment (e.g. lasers, lights, pistol grips, etc.) and freeing up rail space on the front hand guard of the soldier?s weapon system in order to maintain a stable and solid firing position is critical to mission success.  These factors will reduce soldier fatigue and free the weapon system of obstructions in order to accurately engage enemy personnel targets.  The MFAD shall incorporate the following components into a single, integrated system: a day sight, Infrared (IR) laser pointer, IR illuminator, visible laser pointer, and white light flashlight.

This Request for Information (RFI) is to assist the Government in determining the extent and capabilities of existing technology to meet the requirements of the MFAD.  The Government places emphasis on the proposed system?s size, light weight, and its ability to achieve the stated requirements.   The Government anticipates a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) to be published in 4Q FY07 or 1QFY08 based on the outcome of this RFI. 

The Government requests respondees provide a plan to achieve the Threshold/Objective (T/O) requirements in a concise manner which shall consist of no greater than 10 pages and be composed in Times New Roman 12 pt font.    The Government requests that the offeror?s intended plan include a Schedule and Compliance Matrix detailing the plan?s compliance to stated specifications.  The intended plan shall also include an estimated cost which shall consist of all design, development, non-recurring engineering and production costs for 10 prototype units which shall be used for testing and operational evaluation by the user.  Additionally, respondees shall submit a proposed production plan to meet fabrication requirements from approximately 2,300 units to a total production potential of 10,000 units.

<DESC>1.      The attached Supplemental Package supports the advanced synopsis for the IHPRPT RFI. This package provides information and guidelines for preparing Advanced Rocket Propulsion Plans (ARPPs). This RFI request is open to all appropriate organizations, individuals, and contractors.  Any interested party not previously associated with the IHPRPT program should be aware of the following: The IHPRPT program will involve technology acquisitions that have military or space applications and are subject to Air Force Material Command FAR Supplement, Section 5393, Foreign Disclosure Reviews.  In addition, foreign owned or influenced firms and foreign governments will not be allowed to participate as prime contractors.  Only U.S. contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), Federal Center, Battle Creek, Michigan or who are teamed with one of the registered contractors will have access to restricted information which will contain key data, such as goals and baselines. 

2.  Synopsis:	
This is not a Request for Proposal but is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  The Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) program is a DoD/NASA/industry coordinated effort to develop revolutionary and innovative technologies by the year 2010 that will permit a doubling of rocket propulsion capabilities over the 1993 state-of-the-art technology.  The program is structured in three phases, with a nominal Phase III completion date of 2010.  The information provided through the Advanced Rocket Propulsion Plans (ARPPs) will be used to review and revise the Government Rocket Propulsion Plan (GRPP) and to aid in requirements definition for future acquisitions.  A review team comprised of DoD and NASA representatives will review the ARPPs submitted by the United States (U.S.) Rocket Propulsion Industry applicable to the mission application areas stated below.  U.S. Rocket Propulsion Industry companies who participate in this program must develop or update ARPPs mapping out their recent past, on-going and planned rocket propulsion research and development (R&D) efforts, consistent with the IHPRPT program goals. 

3.    The Government is interested in obtaining technical and programmatic information from industry in the form of ARPPs regarding how future goals for the IHPRPT program may be met.  The propulsion application areas of interest are Boost and Orbit Transfer Propulsion (including propulsion efforts of Technology for the Sustainment of Strategic Systems (TSSS) IPT and missile defense), Spacecraft Propulsion, and Tactical Propulsion mission application areas.  The baseline data and goal summary information is included in the IHPRPT RFI supplemental package for the mission application areas relative to the IHPRPT efforts.  A contractor who currently does not have an ARPP, but wishes to respond to the RFI must as a minimum, generate an ARPP that will satisfy all IHPRPT goals applicable to at least one propulsion system type and phase within an application area.  Also as part of the ARPP the plan to use small business innovative research organizations is appropriate is requested.

4.    The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information requested under this RFI.  This is not a request for proposal or an invitation for bid, but a request for information only. Detailed supplemental packages Section I, Section II, III, and Section VI  are attached, Section IV, and V are available upon request. Those who have not previously been associated with the IHPRPT program should be aware of the following:  The IHPRPT program will involve technology acquisitions that have military or space applications and are subject to Air Force Materiel Command FAR supplement, Subpart 5327.90, Foreign Disclosure.  In addition, foreign owned or influenced firms and foreign governments will not be allowed to participate as prime contractors.  Only U.S. contractors who are registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and have a legitimate business purpose or who are teamed with one of the registered contractors will have access to the IHPRPT RFI supplemental package containing restricted information.  If you are registered in the CCR, you must submit a copy of the approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for the supplemental package.  To receive a copy of the IHPRPT RFI supplemental package; please contact contracting POC listed in Paragraph 6 of this notice. Submitters are advised that representatives from DoD and NASA, as well as employees of Aerospace Corporation; SPARTA Inc.; Jackson and Tull Inc.; Sverdrup, Inc.; Nyma Inc.; Centech Group Inc.. and others may assist the government as advisors in reviewing the ARPPs.  The government will ensure the required non-disclosure agreements are in place prior to allowing the support contractors to review the ARPPs.  Any objection to the disclosure of information to these non-government advisors should be provided in writing BEFORE the date set for receipt of documents and shall include a detailed statement for the basis of the objection.  The government ARPP review team will provide written comments to each contractor specifically in the following areas: completeness, strengths, weaknesses, cost and probability of successful completion (program management and technical approach).  The comments will be based on the following: Does the ARPP address all the IHPRPT goals within all the phases of the selected mission application area(s)?  What are the strengths and weaknesses?  Is this a viable plan and do the projects integrate together toward a demonstration of simultaneous goal achievement?  Does the ARPP contain all the information requested in the RFI and Supplemental Package?  Is the ARPP clear, concise and well organized?  Oral presentations of the ARPPs will be scheduled to occur at each respective responder?s facility.

5.    The ARPP shall describe in detail the contractor's plan for full achievement of all the time-phased goals for each proposed propulsion system type within an application area(s); Boost and Orbit Transfer, Spacecraft Propulsion, and Tactical Propulsion.  The contractor may propose work in one or all application areas, but must address all goals (referenced in the supplemental package) and remaining phases within any proposed application area for each type of propulsion system discussed.  New, innovative concepts and processes are encouraged.  It is the intent of the government to issue a call for ARPPs on a biannual basis.

We request you send one original hard copy and subsequent electronic copies as indicated below, to each of the principle government organizations participating in the review.  They are listed as follows with the preferred number of copies, addressee and address (Refer to Supplemental Information Section I for ARPP content and guidelines).

<DESC>The following are questions and NAVAIR Reponses, received in response to Sources Sought notice for a radar requirement for the Vertical Takeoff and Landing Unmanned Air Vehicle (VTUAV), Reference Number VTUAV05-07SS.  Question 1:  Section 1.0 of the Draft SOO refers to integration of a VTUAV radar into the weapon system.  Please describe the requirements or objectives for this integration.  Answer 1:  Please provide a company perspective on how to integrate a proven radar system onto our air vehicle.  NAVAIR does not want to restrict any ideas.  Question 2:  Section 1.2 of the Draft SOO states that interested sources are requested to provide information on the detection and tracking capabilities of the system against small craft with radar cross sections ranging from 0 to 20 dBsm. To provide the Navy with a quantitative response, a contractor will need to estimate the size of the radar antenna that can be installed on the VTUAV.  Please provide information and/or guidance on the locations on the VTUAV available for installation of an antenna/pedestal unit (i.e. nose, bottom fuselage, etc.) and a description of the volume that might be available for this purpose.  Answer 2:  The payload bay volume, internal to the Air Vehicle, is less than or equal to 2 cubic feet. This assumes 2 inches of clearance from the nosecone shell and ample clearance around compartment for sufficient air circulation. The distance from the bulkhead to the tip of the standard nosecone is approximately 33 inches.  It is NAVAIRs desire to retain the standard nose cone.  This configuration assumes the radar would go into the available nose cone space and not displace the existing payload.  This is preferred.  Question 3:  From Section 2.1 of the Draft SOO: The test objectives include testing and providing all engineering data required to support a Navy Flight Clearance for shipboard operations. Please explain or describe what is meant by a Navy Flight Clearance for shipboard operations.  Answer 3:  Configuration change of this magnitude to both hardware and software will require a modification to the existing flight clearance.  All responses are expected to adhere to the technical and managerial procedures required to obtain and support a flight clearance for a radar equipped VTUAV.  Question 4:  From Section 2.4 of the Draft SOO: Compatibility of the data with the existing Government Program is required. Please describe the logistics elements of the existing Government Program with which a logistics program for the VTUAV radar would have to be compatible.  Answer 4:  Organizational to Depot or OEM is our maintenance concept.  The radar WRA's will be replaceable after initial testing/assessment via our Portable Electronic Display Device (PEDD). The PEDD is a rugged portable computing device to support preflight checkout, post-flight maintenance data collection, and general maintenance support functions for the Fire Scout.  PEDD's GUI (Graphical User Interface) allows ground crew personnel to diagnose problems, access the appropriate IETM's (Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals) for fault isolation/repair procedures, and subsequently download, archive, and/or transfer maintenance data.  Question 5:  Is the VTUAV for which radar system information is sought the RQ-8A? Answer 5:  The actual designation is the MQ-8B.  RQ-8A was the prototype precursor to the MQ version.  Question 6:  We request the opportunity to describe our SeaWatch-EL radar and its applicability to objectives in the Draft VTUAV Radar System SOO in a presentation at NAVAIR to interested members of the VTUAV Program. Can this presentation be scheduled before the Source Sought Solicitation response date of Aug. 21, 2007?  Answer 6:  Presentations will not be scheduled at this time.  NAVAIR anticipates a Radar Industry Day after all responses are received.   Question 7:  Would it be possible to brief, and/or provide an operational demo to, the VTUAV Technical POC prior to the August 21st due date for RFI responses?  Answer 7:  Briefs and operational demo will not be scheduled at this time.  NAVAIR anticipates a Radar Industry Day after all responses are received.  Question 8:  Is it permissible to contact the TPOC? If so, can you provide contact information for the TPOC?  Answer 8:  No, it is not permissible to contact the TPOC at this time.  All correspondence will be done through NAVAIR contracts, Ms. Diana Harritt.  Question 9:  Is it acceptable to submit a capability response and ROM to Diana Harritt via email, vice mailing/shipping via USPS or FedEx?  Answer 9:  It is acceptable to submit capability responses and ROMs to Ms. Diana Harritt via email at diana.harritt@navy.mil.

ID Verification System authenticates identification media by interfacing with the Defense ID system, Federal Data Storage Terminals, the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC), Terrorism Watch list and Immigrations and Naturalizations Service?s data bases.  This system allows the entry controller to quickly scan various forms of identification including military ID cards, driver?s licenses and passports.  Thus, security is realized at our first line of defense?the Installation?s Entry Control Point.  Additionally, the system provides visitor center and contractor badge processing reliable venues to quickly process individuals with enhanced screening against multiple consolidated data bases.  This capability greatly reduces (if not completely eliminates) a perpetrators ability to gain access to the installation with fraudulent or stolen identification of any type.  Additionally, our contractor/visitor processing center would receive instantaneous feedback on individuals whose names appear on debarment lists; terrorist watch lists; Federal, State or Local be-on-the-lookout (BOLO) lists.

<DESC>A. General Information:
The Heartland Region, TRBO Region 5, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 5 Army, Navy, and Air Force, medical treatment facilities (MTF's) in Ohio, Kentucky, and Illinois announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of IV Infusion Pumps, Tubing and Supplies. The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price. A single selection is intended in this project; however, the Heartland Region acknowledges the possibility of multiple selections for this agreement. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Clinics, Illinois, Naval Health Clinics Great Lakes, Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital, Ft Campbell Kentucky, and Ireland Army Community Hospital, Ft Knox, Kentucky.
This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor Program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, (DSCP) Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) with the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items.  This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is NOT a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime Vendor program please access the web site at: https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil 
The agreement with incentive pricing will be based on a committed volume for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from the date of award with three (3) - 12 month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  A single selection is intended in this project; however, the Heartland Region acknowledges the possibility of multiple selections for this agreement.  Consideration will be based on best value to Government, based on evaluation of factors listed here.  Anticipated award date is September 2007.  The products will be evaluated on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The award will be determined utilizing Best Value/trade off criteria.       
     Point of Contact is Phyllis Targett 937-257-9075 phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil
B. Products and Performance Required
   The Heartland Region is seeking product lines in the category of IV Infusion Pumps, Tubing and Supplies.  The yearly estimated total volume for IV Infusion Pumps, Tubing and Supplies is $303,766.66.  This is based on the historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period.  
  At the request of the Heartland Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brand, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.
C. Instructions to Offerors
DAPA holders who are interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) Point of Contact (Name and phone number, fax, email address, and Solicitation Number) to Phyllis Targett @ phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil   (937) 257-9075 before 4:00 P.M. EST on the date listed for closing on the FBO announcement in order to remain competitive.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.
This process will ultimately include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical/company criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Heartland Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before 4:00 P.M. EST on the date listed for closing on the FBO announcement in order to remain competitive.  Vendors that fail to meet the re-submittal deadline will be disqualified.    
D.  Evaluation Criteria
   The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTF?s in the Heartland Region.  They are the final decision makers for this initiative. 
Phase I.  Vendors will be required to the provide responses to the technical/company criteria.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the solicitation response will be eliminated from the standardization process.  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will review the responses and determine acceptability.  After review of technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in Phase II, the clinical/performance evaluation.  All Technical/Company Criteria are equally weighted.
Phase II.  The TRBO will request product samples from the product group to be evaluated in a clinical setting at select MTF?s. Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTF?s.  A three-week period will be allotted to vendors for shipment. Samples must be submitted by COB at 4PM local time, 21 calendar days after request. Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.     
    Specific MTF?s will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert like one to five rating scale ranging from one, which is equal to not acceptable and five, which is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance questions are equally weighted.  The CPT has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all product groups.  Clinical/performance results lower than a 3.75 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.
Phase III.  After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who meet the minimum 3.75 threshold will be invited to participate in Phase III, pricing evaluations.  All vendors will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTF?s in the Heartland Region.
     Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  Pricing will be evaluated based on the best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified. 
E. Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation
In Phase I, the CPT will review the following technical/company criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the quoter?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the quoter has a DAPA for the items; 4) the quoter has a distribution agreement covering the items, with Owens and Minor, the current Prime Vendor for the region; 5) the quoter intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and 6) the quoter?s information provided is factually correct (any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.)

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV, Field Studies Branch of the Division of Respiratory Disease Studies Intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to West 
Virginia University, 886 Chestnut Ridge Road, Morgantown, WV 26505 for one Masters Level statistician that will spend on average 20 hours per week at DRDS/NIOSH, for a period of two years, working with Field Studies Branch researchers carrying out this service. This statistician will work with FSB researchers on ongoing research studies and will provide SAS 
programming and statistical analysis support to Field Studies Branch research projects. The contractor will also provide a PhD level Principal Investigator for this project and  PhD level 
statistician, at 5% and 12.5% respectively, to provide general supervision of the Masters Level statistician and to provide Statistical consultation to NIOSH researchers either directly or through the contracted Masters Level statistician. Field Studies Branch researchers will provide day to day technical direction for the individual contract statistician.  The PI will be responsible for overall management of contract work and contract personnel.

The initial contract (200-2005-M-13695) for this work was competed in FY2005 with West Virginia University (WVU) being the winner of the contract.  WVU provided the best price and was the only contractor that could provide local on-site statisticians.  WVU staff have now been working/consulting with NIOSH researchers for 2 years, are security cleared, understand NIOSH privacy and confidentiality issues, and most importantly are integrally involved in ongoing research projects and programs.  Changing contractors would result in starting over with a new contractor, and new statisticians, and would be very disruptive to ongoing research projects.  The learning curve to get integrated into projects is steep and would result in significant time loss and project delays.  This would be very cost inefficient to the government. 
	
Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their capabilities statement and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.  Please forward capabilities and supporting information to: Rebecca Mullenax, Reference 000HCCHB-2007-44256, DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, or E-mail rmullenax@cdc.gov  or fax to 304-285-6083.   

The government will review any/all capabilities statements and supporting information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide the requirement.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a federal contract. Vendors may register at www.ccr.gov. 

If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with  West Virginia University as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

Title:  Office on Disability Program Coordination and Technical Management.

Contracting Office Address
Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management, Parklawn Building Room 5-101, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD, 20857

Description:

The Department of health and Human Services, Office on Disablity through the Program Support Center has a requirement for a contractor to provide  technical and program management services for two national initiatives as well as for program coordination between the Office on Disability (OD), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and government agencies and not-for-profit organizations, evaluation design, program analysis, report writing, and speech writing.  A description of these initiatives and associated functions follows:  

National Initiative 1:  Evaluating the Physical Fitness Initiative for Children and Youth with Disabilities

The HHS Office on Disabilities oversees the coordination, development, and implementation of programs and special initiatives within HHS that impact people with disabilities.  One of the special initiatives addresses health needs; it seeks to increase physical fitness in children and youth with disabilities.   This is an extension of the Department?s campaign against obesity through increased physical activity and good nutritional practices.  It is in concert with the Secretary and Surgeon General?s campaign on improving the health of American children through increased physical activity and good nutrition and responds to the health promotion objectives in Chapter Six of Health People 2010.  The long-range purpose is to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities.  
Collaborating disability-based national organizations across the country will link physically fit mentors (who may or may not have a disability) with children who are disabled. The mentors will provide training and guidance to help the children become physically active by accumulating minutes of physical activity daily to earn the Presidential Active Lifestyle Award (PALA), and, with continued encouragement, strive to earn a Presidential Champions Award by accumulating points for a bronze, silver or gold medal.  The mentors will also provide the children with nutritional information and encouragement.
National Initiative 2:  Staff HHS? New Freedom Initiative Caregiver Subcommittee
In 2001, President Bush announced the New Freedom Initiative as part of a nationwide effort to remove barriers to community living for people with disabilities. Today, a full 20 percent of the U.S. population?more than 54 million Americans--are living with a disability.  Almost half of these individuals have a severe disability affecting their ability to see, hear, walk or perform other basic functions of life. In addition, there are more than 25 million family caregivers and millions more who provide aid and assistance to people with disabilities. 
The New Freedom Initiative is a comprehensive plan to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to learn and develop skills, engage in productive work, make choices about their daily lives and participate fully in community life. The Initiative's goals are to: increase access to assistive and universally designed technologies; expand educational opportunities; promote homeownership; integrate Americans with disabilities into the workforce; expand transportation options; and promote full access to community life. 
The New Freedom Initiative Caregiving Subcommittee, composed of all HHS agencies, was established to identify and coordinate existing caregiver support activities across agencies within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

<DESC>The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab is exploring commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies related to home station aircraft maintenance that will minimize/eliminate waiting for tool/equipment issue at shift change.  The system proposed should create one or more mobile tool issue units that can be placed strategically on the flightline or travel between aircraft as required. The unit should use identification technology capable of tracking individual tools and automated storage, issuing and tracking of deployed tools, and equipment and consumables related to aircraft maintenance activities. The system must carry the necessary tools to accomplish approximately 80% of the common daily maintenance tasks encountered on large frame aircraft such as the C-5, C-17 and KC-10.  It must use Radio Frequency (RF) tags or other tagging methods (Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), low wave Identification etc.) capable of being in direct contact with metal items and near liquids.  The system should utilize "smart toolboxes" for multi tool boxes.  This smart box would be capable of sensing/ reading tools located with in it and visually indicate, through a light or signal, if a tool is missing. The system must be compatible with current Tool Accountability Software and should have the capability to ensure inventory of a multi-tool tool box is accomplished when tool box is returned to storage.  Tracking technology should also be used in such a manner as to be able to locate tagged items on the flightline. This RFI may be followed by a request for proposal to conduct a Battlelab Concept Demonstration.  All possible offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.

<DESC>1.  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is interested in obtaining a contractor who can develop and implement an electronic filing system for both public and nonpublic filings in matters pending before the agency?s Administrative Law Judges and Commissioners under 16 CFR Part 3.  The agency would like to develop a web-based system that allows internal and external parties to electronically file their public and confidential pleadings in various pending proceedings.  The system should allow for secure user registration; web submission of filings; a process for review and tracking files and exporting public files for placement on the agency?s website at www.ftc.gov.  The user registration feature should include standard security features such as user ids and passwords and should allow for some form of authentication.  The web-based online filing system must operate in real time and include notification to designated agency staff that a filing has arrived.  Lastly, the agency is interested in identifying an efficient mechanism for archiving the associated metadata, i.e., submitter?s name; case number and name; date of filing and title of document and the associated physical  content files for historical searching and permanent offsite storage.

In order to ensure that only those vendors who have the capability of providing the services required in paragraph 1, FTC is using the procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15.202, "Advisory Multi-Step Process".  The two-phase approach consists of submission of corporate capability statements and participation in oral presentations (Phase I), and submission of written technical information and cost/price proposals (Phase II):

A.  Phase I:  Interested contractors/vendors will provide limited information in response to subparagraph 1 above as follows:

I.  Corporate Capability Statement:  List of services/products commercially available, or that can be available by the agreed upon contract performance due date, that comply with this pre-solicitation notice. The Corporate Capability Statement shall be no longer than 4 type written pages. 

II.  Past Performance Information:  References from at least 3 customers, of which at least 2 will be for contracts that have been completed. The work must be similar in nature to this requirement in scope and must have been completed within the last 3 years.  The Past Performance Information is not included in the 4 page limitation for submission of corporate capability statements.

III.  Confirmation of the vendor's availability to participate in Oral Presentations.  The oral presentations are an informal discussion between the vendor and the government.  Vendors are encouraged to provide a product demonstration at this time.  No discussion of cost will be allowed at this phase

a.  Oral presentations will be held approximately 4 weeks from the date of this posting.  Invitees will be given morning and afternoon options for presentation times.  Invitees may participate either on-site at FTC Headquarters, or via telephone;
b.  Oral presentations will be limited to 2 hours in length and the vendor should expect to answer technical questions regarding the use of vendor's product; and

c.  If the vendor's product is not a fully developed commercial, off-the-shelf product, the vendor's key personnel (i.e., subject matter expert) responsible for development of the product shall participate in the oral presentations. 

B.  Phase II:  The FTC shall evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated above, and shall advise each respondent in writing either that they will be invited to submit written technical information and a cost/price proposal or, based on the information submitted during Phase I, that they are unlikely to be a viable competitor.  The FTC shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion and state that notwithstanding the advice provided by the FTC in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.

C.  Only those parties who submit corporate capability statements, past performance information, and respond affirmatively that they would be available for oral presentations will be eligible to move through the proposal process.

D.  Corporate capability statements, past performance information and confirmation of availability of vendor to participate in oral presentations are due to the Contracting Officer no later than 3:00 PM EST, two weeks from the date this synopsis is published.  Responses shall be sent via email to hcurlee@ftc.gov

<DESC>Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) Acquisition and Procurement Office (A&PO) is looking for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Businesses for a possible future requirement.  
The nature of the project is to design and build a system which would inhibit the flow of smoke into areas of egress, corridors, and stairwells. It would be activated automatically during the early stages of a fire to compartmentalize the smoke and to maintain a survivable environment, e.g. contain the smoke in the fire zone of origin, especially for those personnel evacuating from the more remote corridors and offices. This project will create compartmentalized smoke control zones at minimum, coordinated with the fire zones, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) controls throughout the site.  
In accordance with FAR 36.206, the estimated magnitude of this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  Due to the sensitive nature of the work location, prospective contractors are required to possess an active facility clearance.  The geographic location where the work is to be performed is in southern Pennsylvania near the Maryland border.
Interested parties should e-mail or fax a detailed package indicating their capabilities and experience no later than 30 June 2007 to randall.jewett.ctr@whs.mil ; fax number 703-614-6329.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to request submission of SF-330s for use in selecting a firm to perform professional engineering services.  This is not a request for proposal.  A set-aside determination will be made after receipt of SF-330s and a firm fixed price contract will be pursued with the most highly qualified firm.  The project is being administered by the U.S. Indian Health Service (IHS) for the benefit of the Spokane Tribe of Indians, based in Wellpinit, Washington.  
        -------------------         
Work covered under this project consists of a hydrogeologic study and other professional services.  The purpose of the hydrogeologic study is to identify and evaluate options for bringing two water systems on the Spokane Indian Reservation into compliance with EPAs new arsenic standard.  The project will be accomplished in three phases.   Phase 1 is required, phases 2 and 3 may or may not be required depending on the results of Phase 1.
        -------------------         	
Phase 1 Hydrogeological Data Collection includes accessing and compiling existing data characterizing the local aquifers in order to determine the geologic setting of known arsenic-enriched groundwater.  Depth of research for each system shall be sufficient to conclude likely source(s) of elevated arsenic in water system wells.  Water quality data shall be provided by IHS for accessible wells in the vicinity of the community wells and shall include analyses for the following parameters: Total Arsenic (As), As III, As V, Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), Hardness as CaCO3, Sodium (Na), Silica (SiO2), Phosphate (PO4-P), Sulfate (SO4), Chloride (Cl), pH, Total Alkalinity as CACO3, Total Organic Carbon (TOC)
        -------------------         
Based on professional interpretation of the data gathered for each system, the Consultant shall develop a preliminary conceptual site model that captures the quantity and quality of known occurrences of potable groundwater resources in each area. 

Upon review of the conceptual site model, if IHS and the Tribe determine that new water sources and/or blending water sources are not feasible options for either or both of the water systems, the Consultant will be directed to bypass Phase 2 of this Project Scope and proceed with Phase 3 as outlined below.
        -------------------         
Phase 2 Physical Investigation of Local Aquifers   consists of physical investigation based on the conceptual site model(s) developed in Phase 1.  Physical investigation shall implemented to verify (if possible) the existence of arsenic-free or low-arsenic water sources for each system.  Physical investigation may include hydrogeological modeling of the aquifer(s), geophysical assessment of subsurface conditions, or other technical strategies proposed by the Consultant and approved by the Tribe and IHS.
        -------------------         
Phase 2 reporting shall include an Engineering Report that provides detailed recommendations with cost estimates (including capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, and replacement costs) for siting, drilling, developing, and delivering water of adequate quality and quantity from new full-scale production wells and/or blending new production wells with existing water wells for each water system.  Recommendations for siting future production wells shall include GPS coordinates with mapped locations.  Phase 2 reporting shall also include narrative discussion and graphical presentation of well siting recommendations through surface maps and subsurface cross sections.  Background analytical data, pump test results, geophysical output, relevant reports, and other pertinent information shall be made part of the Engineering Report via appendices.  Separate documents are required for each of the two water systems.
        -------------------         
Upon review of the Engineering Reports, if IHS and the Tribe determine that new water sources and/or blending water sources are not feasible options for either or both of the water systems, the Consultant shall be directed to proceed with Phase 3.
        -------------------         
Phase 3 Arsenic Treatment Technology Analysis & Design ? includes analysis of arsenic treatment technology alternatives and their applicability to the local water systems, recommendation of an arsenic treatment system, and a preliminary design of the recommended treatment system(s).  Cost estimates (including capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, and replacement costs) shall be provided for each of the alternatives considered.  The Consultant shall also identify any environmental issues associated with each of the alternatives considered.  Upon reaching an agreement with IHS on the preferred treatment method, the Consultant shall develop a preliminary design to include plans, specifications, and building and equipment requirements.  A site survey shall not be required.   
        -------------------         
Performance Period ? It is anticipated that the requirements set forth herein as Phase 1 of the work will be fulfilled within 40 calendar days after receipt of the start work order from IHS.  Upon completion of Phase 1, a determination shall be made whether to proceed with Phase 2 work or to bypass Phase 2 and proceed with Phase 3 work.  Phase 2, if required, will be fulfilled within 105 calendar days after completion of Phase 1.  Phase 3, if needed, will be fulfilled within 75 calendar days after completion of Phase 2.

<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) designs and manufactures US currency (Federal Reserve Notes (note) for the Federal Reserve System.  This RFI seeks information to develop technology to assist the blind or visually impaired (estimated to be over one million people in the U.S.) with the ability to positively identify the specific denomination of a note.  The proliferation of cell phones with embedded cameras (camera phone) presents a unique opportunity to harness the processing power in the camera phone to provide the note identification function via the incorporation of software on the camera phone.  The BEP is seeking technological solutions and business information from entities capable of providing this functionality as a service to the public.
This RFI is not seeking information associated with any other type of electronic reader. This RFI is for camera phone based solutions only.
The concept of operation is that a person (user) invokes a special software program (application) pre-loaded onto their camera phone and takes a camera phone based photograph of a note.  The camera phone processes the image, correctly identifies the specific denomination and outputs the denomination value as either a spoken word over the camera phone?s speaker or a vibratory pulse using the camera phone?s vibration notification capability.

<DESC>The US Forest Service is interested in finding potential sources to provide Type 1 infrared services used to detect and map wildland fires. The government intends to set up multiple basic ordering/purchase agreements (BOA/BPA) with qualified vendors to provide these services on an as needed basis. Type 1 infrared systems are utilized to detect small heat sources distributed over large geographic areas and to map large wildland fires. Type 1 systems are capable of imaging large wildland fire incidents quickly to provide data for the Situation Unit Leader (SITL).  The information is used to help in the development of the Incident Action Plan (IAP).  Type 1 infrared systems are mounted on twin-engine or jet aircraft and can cover large geographic areas quickly. The government would require the contractor to be on call and provide the aircraft, pilot, Type 1 sensor system, associated support equipment and sensor operator. The contractor will be responsible for providing the sensor output (data) in a format that is compatible with the Forest Service and Department of Interior Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The government base of operations for these services will be the National Interagency Fire Center located in Boise, ID.

If you have any interest in providing these services to the government please contact Matt Olson, Contracting Specialist, by 26 June 2007 in order to discuss the possibility of setting up a BPA with your company.

<DESC>The Government is contemplating awarding a Purchase Order to Livermore  Software Technology Corporation (LSTC), Livermore, CA, for LS Dyna software  subscription Right to Use licenses, Right to Use support and software  maintenance.  ARDEC users of the LS Dyna code have increased, and are likely  to continue to increase in order to meet current and future Army program  analytical requirements.  Livermore Software Technology Corporation (LSTC) is  the sole developer, manufacturer, modifier,  provider, and distributor of LS  Dyna software. In addition, its source codes used to write the software  programs are proprietary to the company and protected under copyright patent  laws.  Therefore, enhancing and/or upgrading the software can only be done by  the developer for the same reason.  FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii), only one  responsible source is applicable to this requirement; awarding this purchase  order to any other source would create substantial cost duplication and  unacceptable delays to the Government that is not expected to be recovered  through competition.  The procurement is for Software Right to Use Licenses,  software support and maintenance for a Base Year and three Option Years, with  the number of licenses increasing in the subsequent three Option Years.  Interested sources should submit their qualification data not later than  5:00 P.M. EST on July 03, 2007 to JM&L LCMC Acquisition Center, Picatinny  Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, ATTN: Robert M.

<SUBJECT>R -- Technical Assistance Services for the Office of Rural Health Policy
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to contract with, on a sole source basis, the National
Rural Health Association (NRHA), Kansas City, Missouri.  This contract directly supports the Legislative Authorization of the Offiice of Rural Health Policy(ORHP) as created by Section 711 of the Social Security Act .The purpose of this contract is to purchase a broad range of Services designed to strengthen ORHP?s support of rural communities. Through this contract ORHP will:
 
- Provide technical assistance to State Rural Health Associations and conduct skill  building workshops for these grassroots entities.

- Develop leadership capacity at the grassroots level.

- Gather information about the effects of implementation of Medicare and Medicaid 
   reforms on rural health access to services, providers, pharmacists and systems of care.


The NRHAis uniquely qualified to provide these services to ORHP.  NRHA is a nonprofit association composed of individual and organizational members who share a common interest in rural health. For the past 28 years, NRHA has provided a forum for the exchange and dissemination of ideas, information, research and methods to improve rural health.

In addition to constituency groups, the members participate in 7 issue groups: rural health networks, leading the national quality effort, academic/community partnerships, rural pharmacy, rural public health, rural and frontier emergency medical services, universal access and Medicaid. 

NRHA is the only entity whose membership includes State Rural Health Associations and State Offices of Rural; as well as local health providers.  NRHA?s reputation and diversity and stringent membership will be essential to providing ORHP with meaningful information about the effect of health policies in rural communities and distinguishes it as a uniquely qualified organization.  Because it has a long history in serving rural communities, NRHA has the resources and ability to begin work on these tasks immediately. It is likely that a one(1) year contract with a base year and two(2) option years may result. Using any other vendor would significantly increase the costs, decrease the quality and delay the acquisition of these products. This justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is processed under the authority in 41 U.S.C. 253(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 (ii) A, ?it is likely that an award to any other service would result in-(A) substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered 
 through competition.? This notice of intent is for information purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals. See Numbered Note 22.

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) FOR UPGRADE A PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENTS TRACKING SYSTEM (PETS)

1.	Scope

The contractor shall produce; test and deliver the additional features and functional upgrade to existing Edwards GPS Personnel and Equipments Tracking software (GPS Flight Team Software) and hardware in accordance with this Statement of Work (SOW). This upgrade will be for ground Range operational safety use. 


	1.1 Background

The P/ETS is a hand held radio system consisting of a GPS receiver/transmitter integrated into an RF transmitter. The transmitter radiates on 900 MHz with 100-mw power output and is received by a GPS receiver. This receiver interfaces to Edwards AFB ground fiber network through an Ethernet connection. The system is compliant with Part 15 of FCC Rules regarding frequency and spectrum use. This system will provide users with the ability to track multiple, independent objects (200 OBJ) across wide areas of the PIRA Ranges (East and West) in real-time. The position information is displayed on a standard PC hosting the GPS-TEAM mapping software. This software displays a map overlay upon which the Range map has been laid. Users will appear as a beacon (RF reference signal) on the Edwards AFB map, updating their position often enough to allow the operator to track the vehicles or personnel movements in real-time at Downfall or any other location with access to the network. The block diagram below shows subsystem layout of the GPS-Flight-STXe transmitter platform, which shows how it sends data to the ground over the air link. On the ground, a PC connects to the RX-Base receiver unit to display the data onscreen. 


2.	General Requirements

	2.1 Software requirements
The contractor shall modify the existing GPS Flight Team Software, test, and deliver working map display and the associated hardware and user interfaces to support map display, map manipulation, navigation, and map creation from positional data that contains all the features and meets (or exceeds) all of the functional software performance requirements with the following characteristics:

2.1.1 Recording and Storing Data
?	Develop a recording subsystem that will store all recorded data to a local file archiving on a day-day basis creating a file that is time stamped each day, and can be saved. 
?	The file will contain the Trac-ID data for all devices being tracked base wide, run unattended, and record data even if the GPS-Team software is not running or is being used for other purposes (this will be a service with its own schedule priority).
?	User must be able to enter the settings menu and turn on ?archive service? allowing control over this application.
?	User must be able to set the time interval that new files are saved and select time length in hours from 1 to 24 hour intervals.
?	The archive file name will be named by their (date)/ (Hour) for easy sorting.  
?	Recorded files may be stored on a PC and shared using windows file sharing to enable other networked PC with access to the file to play it back using another copy of GPS-Team software.
?	The playback should try to use the same maps and assets if they are available locally.  If they are not available, the file shall be able to play without them.
?	Allow data to be in a shared windows folder to enable remote PCs to read from that point.

2.1.2 Playback of Recorded Files
?	The system should open a new window for playback of recorded files without interrupting the current recording or display of real time data.
?	The recorded files should attempt to use the same maps; assets associated with those maps, but NOT interrupt the ability of the first application to continue to display data coming in real-time. 
?	Support reading Trac-ID data off of the Internet via an Internet connected RX Base unit. 

2.1.3 Custom Map Support
?	Support custom maps that are installed into the application, and given coordinates. User must be able to choose from several maps stored with coordinates so they can ?switch? between them easily.
?	Support option to use the World File coordinate system. 
?	World files stored in the same directory as the maps, and named with the same name as the map name will result in automatic reading of map coordinates and map setup .
?	Easy to add a map to the application so it can be saved and re-used
?	Map image files and coordinate files will be stored in a folder known by the application
?	A coordinate text file may be stored in the folder with the same name as the map, containing the 4 coordinates for the map.
?	If a map and coordinate text file exists (World file or Coordinate), the user will not have to manually enter the coordinates into the map setup
?	If no coordinate file exists, the user may enter the coordinates for the 4 corners of the map in lat-long decimal format making the map usable
?	Google maps (moving) will be supported including zoom and automatic pan functions
?	Creation of new Map Features:  These Map Features will be  geo-located on the coordinate system, and include Zones, Points of Interest (POIs), and enable target destinations.
?	Creating a new zone will be accomplished by right clicking and drawing the zone until complete.
?	Zones may be named (50 char)
?	Zones may be exclusionary or inclusionary ? exclusionary zones will trigger if anyone comes from the outside in, inclusionary zones will trigger if anyone comes from the inside out.
?	Zones may be overlapped
?	Zones may have time-related triggers so they are active only during certain hours. i.e. Active only from 6pm-5am 
?	Any trigger event will be listed in an event window with time, Trac-ID, and zone triggered.
?	A trigger event may play a SOUND also (Set in preferences)
?	Zones may be set to a status of ?Quiet?, the result is no data from reporting Trac-IDs will appear on the map, or in the recorded data for Trac-IDs in Quiet Zones.  The Trac-IDs will be available for assignment in the admin function.
?	Once a Trac-ID leaves a Zone set as Quiet, it will report and record normally on screen and to the database.
?	Map Features (Zones and POIs) will appear in the ?Destination? list when assigning a person to a Trac-ID. 

2.1.4 Administrator User Enhancements:
?	Admin must log in to use the system using the Windows Logon Process
?	Admin will be registered to access GPS-Team, and logins must be tracked to record name and login time.
?	Add tab to allow user to define GROUPS of Trac-IDs such as ?Engineering?, ?Visitors?, ?Operations?, etc.
?	The ?Create Groups? function will be under ?Create Groups? tab ? under Tools-> Options menu, and extend the existing tab control.
?	Allow a user to create, edit, delete Groups, and assign an ICON
?	Add a view that shows all map assets such as Zones, Icons, POIs, and be able to list or delete.
?	Add an Icon library (folder) where Icons (JPG or GIF Image files) are stored for use by the program.  The application will ship with 10 Icons including car, tower, person, danger, plane, truck, boat, house, rocket, Square, and circle.  
?	The default Icon will be set in preferences. If the default Icon is not available, no icon will be displayed.
?	Admin will be able to easily select maps from a list of installed maps

2.1.5	Playback Improvements:
?	Select a Trac-ID file from a local text file or the DB
?	Play the Trac-ID back in a separate window when real-time data is being received on an active COM Port, or on any IP address.
?	Playback of Trac-ID file must continually record or display current ?real time data?
?	Allow user to browse to find specific files; i.e.  a file named "4_17_07" - meaning the day 4_17_07. When opened, the user shall be able to play it back from a time to a time via a dialog - play from 10:15:20 to 10:15:50.
?	Allow a second PC to view the same data as the first PC but NOT record. To play back, data base shall be utilized in a separate window.  Access to the data file will be managed by sharing the folder where the data is kep using Windows networking.
?	Select a recorded file and possibly one track from that file, and then export it to CSV, Trac-ID, or XML.  Extend current function of GPS-Team and enable creation of standalone file for particular Trac-IDs and times.  Such files will be stored locally as text files and named anything the user desires.

2.1.6	 Measure Distance:
?	Allow user to select a 'measure distance' setting from the right click menu on the map. 
?	Allow distance to be counted from point-point, and draw the line showing the distance being calculated. 
?	Show the total distance (pop-up window) in whatever units - default.

     3.  Price

  I.  Delivery Date
     
A.  Evidence of ability to meet the required Delivery Date of July 26, 2007 will be considered.
B.  If vendor is unable to meet the aforementioned required Delivery Date, an alternative date may be offered and will be      considered.

III.   Price

        A.  PRICE ANALYSIS WILL BE CONDUCTED BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

OTI's Sudan program is an integral part of the U.S. Government's effort to strengthen Sudanese confidence and capacity to address the causes and consequences of political conflict, violence, and instability.?The OTI program is being implemented within the framework of both the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and more recently, the 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) and the Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement (ESPA).  OTI currently has five implementing partners in Sudan:  Development Alternatives Inc. (DAI), PACT, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), and Internews Network.  From 2003 to 2006, OTI programmed more than $65 million, including the development and implementation of a small grants program, with the following objectives: 1) to support emerging civil authorities at the state and local levels; 2) to promote engagement of civil society in support of peace processes and dialogue with civil authorities; 3) to increase availability of high-quality and independent information on transition issues; and 4) to protect vulnerable populations in Darfur.

The barriers have two (2) modes of operation:  normal with a raise time of 5 seconds and emergency with a raise time of 2 seconds.  In either mode of operation the traffic light(s) changes from yellow to red and the gate arm(s) lowers.  The raised barrier height is 33-in. above the ground and the lowered height is ? of an in. above the ground.  The barriers are normally down and are only operated once per week for testing purposes only.  The average run time is less then 1000-hrs. per yr.  To ensure continuous operation of the road barriers, it is essential that a routine program of inspection, maintenance and emergency repair services be established and followed.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for a 3D Optical Measurement Instrument. The specifications are in the Statement of Work included in this solicitation. This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item(s) prepared in accordance with the format in FAR part 12, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) set forth in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This notice is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) for 3D Optical Measurement Instrument. Statement of Work follows: Statement of Work - NASA 3D Optical Measurement Instrument Specifications PRINCIPLE Instrument shall allow measurements which are non-contacting, optical, 3 dimensional, based on focus variation.  The operating principle focus variation has been added to the latest ISO standard for classifying surface texture methods. The new ISO Norm 25178 for the first time includes standardized parameters to classify optically area based measurements. USE The instrument shall be able to be used in both laboratory and production environments. The instrument shall be operable using non-skilled technicians where required. Automation of functions and analysis can also be added to make the instrument useable for the majority of surface metrology and inspection requirements NEED Materials Science and Failure Analysis Conventional microscopy inspects the surface optically with light microscopes and is limited by the microscope’s depth of focus. Quantitative surface information shall be obtained by a separate 3D surface analysis instrument. Since specimens in material development often contain fractured surfaces with steep flanks or rough surface topography, NASA requires a solution to digitally measure and inspect the entire surface. The analysis of the optical appearance of the surface coupled with the topographic data shall be directly correlated to the reconstructed 3D color image. Fatigue fracture analysis and material deformation at ductile fracture zones shall be easily quantified through volumetric, area, or profile measurements directly on the true color image. REQUIRED An optical 3D measurement instrument. This instrument shall provide for roughness assessments, quality assurance, and inspection of surfaces. The range shall be extended over centimeters to nanometers. It shall provide all functionalities for dimensional measurements, surface analysis and characterization. Geometries with steep flanks, highly reflective properties and strong roughness shall be measurable with a vertical resolution up to 10 nanometers, with a specific requirement of 50 nanometer resolution with 20 millimeters of working distance, making the instrument ideal for surface study of both homogeneous and compound materials. 3D measurements shall be performed directly in the optical image. The resulting image shall possess full depth of focus, and be able to provide 3D surface measurement in true and false color.   SPECIFIC FEATURE REQUIREMENTS Automation via scripting.   The 3D measurement instrument shall acquire images of the sample and process them using a computer which shall be included as part of the system.  The computer acquisition and control system shall be operated use simple syntax similar to Java Script to easily adapt the system to specific needs. Resulting analysis modules shall be operable by semi skilled staff. Automatic surface defects analysis is one example how scripting can be used. Depths and valleys as well as cracks, holes and other features shall be scanned, measured, and quantified automatically. 2D Image Analysis The 2D image analysis shall allow the performance of manual and semi automatic measurement of simple features. Also, the ability to write on the images as well as saving measurement results in a comprehensive and easy to use database shall be provided: • Manual measurement of lines, parallel lines, arcs, circles, ellipses, polygons, polylines, free hand, marker • Automatic measurement of lines, parallel lines, circles, arcs • Statistical calculation of results such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, median • Automatic search of equally shaped structures on the image Volume Analysis Volume analyses shall calculate the volumes of voids and protrusions. The measurement area shall be defined directly on the optical color image.  For the 3D-boundary of the selected area NASA requires the calculation based on accepted models covering surface that behaves like a soap film: • Selectable area for volume measurement • Selectable reference surface (plane, minimum spanning surface, top and bottom cover) • Automatic calculation of reference plane from 3D points Form Analysis In addition to common surface analysis and characterization, the optical measurement instrument shall measure complex geometries of components. This shall include the alignment of references, and measurement of surface features such as angles, radii etc.  The optical measurement instrument shall also provide the ability to measure and align more complex surface features such as rods, cylinders, and spheres.  The instrument shall include a fully integrated  programmable indexable rotary fixture to rotate cylindrical samples.  Rotation and indexing of the fixture shall be controlled by the automated measurement software. This rotary unit shall have a repeatability of rotation equal or better than 400 micro-radians, planarity equal or better than 20 microns, and control resolution of equal or better than 0.01 degrees. • Automatic measurement of lines, parallel lines, height steps, double height steps and ISO 5435 conform height steps, angles, 2-line-angles, circles and normal distance • Measurement of roundness, evenness and alignment of spheres • Measurement of cylindrical forms over full 360 degrees of rotation. Area Analysis Area analysis shall provide comprehensive and significant measurements to classify the roughness of a surface. Also, analysis shall include information about gradient and spectral distribution. The ROI (region of interest) is selected directly in the optical color image and measurements shall be yielded fast, fully automatically, and robustly. For the visual representation of the surface a grey scale or pseudo colored depth map shall be available: • Analysis of height-distribution • Calculation of area material ratio • Measurement of spatial parameters with auto correlation function,  Fourier spectrum and miscellaneous parameters • Gradient distribution • Calculation of bearing ratio curve and bearing area curve • Calculation of fractal dimension • Filtering of profiles Profile Analysis Profile measurement enables the virtual cutting of a specimen. The user defines a path on the optical color image and receives the corresponding 3D profile. Roughness and contour measurements conform to recognized international EN ISO standards. The profile analysis shall also allow the fitting of features such as circles, angles, notches, or rectangles on flat or cylindrical surfaces.  The optical measurement instrument shall provide further, manual and semi automatic measurement possibilities: • Profile extraction with different width • Filtering of the profile with selectable Lc values with ISO 4288 conformity  • Manual cursor measurement • Roughness and waviness parameter calculations according to ISO 4287 and ISO 11562 • Calculation of Fourier spectrum of profiles and bearing ratio curve • Calculation of statistical parameters of profiles • Calculation of mean and standard deviation of profiles Off-Line Analysis The system shall provide independent desktop computer software and the associated keys or dongles so that two independent desktop computers will be able to perform the full analysis and viewing of 3D and 2D data sets/images produced with the agreed upon instrument.  The desktop software shall be able to import Z Axis image stacks from any optical microscope or vision system and produce compatible images with 3D data and fully extended depth of focus and sharp images. Reflective geometries Different surface compositions and strong topographies can produce strong reflections, interreflections, and under-reflected properties.  The optical measurement instrument shall provide failure analysis and fractography uses to effectively capture spectral variation between over-illuminated and under-illuminated surfaces in a radiometrically-balanced image. Results need to be well exposed in all specular areas and also contain accurate topographic data sets.  Rough surfaces The complex reflective properties of extremely sculptured surfaces can be extremely difficult to resolve and capture with conventional optical systems. The 3D measurement instrument shall be able to easily quantify rough surfaces with the accurate measurement of Ra, Rq and Rz including bearing ratio curve. Measurement of roughness, waviness and contour must conform to recognized international ISO standards. Registered true color information NASA requires a 3D measurement instrument that simultaneously captures the entire surface topographic information in combination with its true color information.  Both the topographic and color information shall be registered to the 3D data file.  3D measurements shall be able to be performed directly on the optical color image.   Steep sided flanks Surfaces often contain steep flanks and vertical edges. These structures are difficult to measure using conventional optical methods. The 3D instrument shall be able to perform dense and robust measurements up to 88°. Features several millimeters deep shall be robustly and traceably captured.  Measurement results shall have the ability to be reproduced with a vertical resolution of up to 10nm;  A minimum of 50 nanometer resolution shall be provided with a working distance of 20 millimeters between the sample and the objective. NASA In-House Self Calibration The 3D optical system shall be delivered with a traceable calibration standard.  Both, the lateral and vertical part of the standard shall be calibrated by national laboratories. The calibration shall also trace back to NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA) and the PTB (Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt, Germany).  The certified calibration standard shall be usable to calibrate the system with either NASA in-house calibration services, and/or manufacturer provided A2LA/ A-Class calibration services.

The OCC shall have the right under the contract to require any Contractor personnel (including, but not limited to, advisors or consultants to the contractor, subcontractors or their personnel, or any other persons under the auspices of the contractor) having access to OCC facilities, information systems, security items and products, and/or sensitive but unclassified information to undergo a security investigation.   The type of investigation conducted shall be determined by the OCC and will depend upon several factors including, but not limited to, the duration of the contract, the kind of access the personnel will have, the sensitivity of the duties the personnel will perform, and whether adequate investigations have previously been done. Investigations can range from credit and fingerprint checks to full background reviews.
Within 14 calendar days after contract award, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) with such information and documentation as may be required by the OCC to have an investigation performed.  Under no circumstances shall contractor employees be given access to OCC facilities, information systems, security items and products, and/or sensitive but unclassified information until the required security forms have been completed and submitted to the Security Officer.
The Contractor shall immediately replace, with equally qualified employee(s), any employee(s) whose security investigation does not result in a favorable adjudication.  The OCC shall have the unilateral right to make security adjudication decisions.
The Contractor shall immediately notify the COTR of any new Contractor employee that will need access to OCC facilities, information systems, security items and products, and/or sensitive but unclassified information.

The Contractor agrees to protect all confidential and/or proprietary information received by or provided to the Contractor pursuant to this contract from unauthorized disclosure or use for as long as the information remains proprietary or confidential and further agrees that it will not use such information for any purpose other than that relating to the performance of this contract.

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i)entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.

The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted.

Technical question and response are hereby provided:

Question 1:
How fixed is the 12 week delivery requirement?  Seems pretty stiff,
unless one has a ready-to-go unit you just fab. up.  (Even then, would
be pretty tight.)

Answer1:
NIST has re-evaluated the delivery requirement and is hereby changed from 12 weeks after receipt of order to 15 weeks after receipt of order.

The due date for quotations remains unchanged.

1.	QUESTION:  CLIN 0001 & 0002 are outlined as linear schedules, as in starting at point A going to point B then returning to point A.  I assume there is work moving in each direction.  Does the work from one end of the schedule require processing by the other end before returning?  

ANSWER:  No, you will not be waiting for processing of any type.  Requirement is for pick up and delivery according to the time schedule in Attachment A - Time Tables.
 

2.	QUESTION:  Could vans on each end pick up work at the same time meet and exchange vehicles at a halfway point and return?  

ANSWER: A possible option. If that would work for your company then you could propose that in your plan. Security is the main concern.

<DESC>1. This amendment is issued to provide a response to all Technical Questions submitted by potential offerors in regards to Solicitation number W9124R-07-T-1063. Responses have been provided as follows: Technical Questions and Answers Solicitation number: W9124R-07-T-1063 Question #1- Paragraph 1.02 - The DRAT vans spinning DFing antenna shall operate within the frequency range from 20MHz continuous to 40 GHz.The available spinning DF systems operate from .5 - 18 GHz and can be extended to 18 - 40GHz. A spinning system i s not available down to 20 MHz  a conventional DF antenna system will be needed for the 20Mhz to 500 MHz band.  The previous SOW referenced a GFE DF system that operates in the 20 MHz to 500 MHz range.  Is this GFE system to be used or is the contractor t o supply a non-spinning, conventional DF system for the 20  500 MHz band?  If a GFE system is to be used, the technical details of that system will be needed in order to properly interface it as well as to budget space, power and weight. Answer #1- The GFE on hand, Doppler Systems, Inc Series 6100 Radio Direction Finder (see system details at http://www.dopsys.com/ser6100.htm) operates from 88 MHz to 1 GHz. and will be simply strapped onto the roof.   It will not be necessary for the contr actor to supply anything for the 20  500 MHz band as 88 MHz will suffice as the lower limit and 1 GHz exceeds the 500 MHz upper limit.. Question #2-Paragraph 1.03 h)  42 Telescoping Mast with platform remote rotation capability. Is this intended to permit remote rotation capability within the van or remote rotation capability from another location? Answer #2- In this case, remote capability means positioning the antenna to any one of 360 degrees from a knob within the van rather than having to exit the vehicle and turn the platform by hand.   The ability to rotate the antenna from another location is not needed.  Question #3-Paragraph 3.0  frequency spectrum from 2 MHz to 40 GHz Is this supposed to be 20MHz to 40GHz? Answer #3- SOW says to monitor 2 MHz - 40 GHz and DF 20 MHz to 40 GHz. Question #4-Paragraph 3.1.4 - The contractor will also support, test, train government personnel, and document the items identified in accordance with applicable documents and this SOW. The level of support desired is not defined in the SOW.   Answer #4- Level of support is identified in para 6.5, 6.6, 6.7,  Question #5-Paragraph 6.6  This summary shall report shall become the completion of system installation and acceptance by the Government. What is this sentence attempting to convey? Answer #5- This is telling you that the testing on the system will be summed in a report and that the report should provide top level synopsis of equipment performance for critical parameters tested on the equipment. Upon government acceptance of the repor t system installation will be completed.  Question #6-Appendix 1 - the signal detection level must be -110 dbm or better Is this intended to be a receiver sensitivity requirement or a system sensitivity requirement?  If it is a system sensitivity requirement it must be concisely defined with reg ard to signals utilized, distance and angles from antennae, etc. for acceptance testing purposes. Answer #6- Receiver sensitivity.  Question #7-Appendix 1 - spectrum coverage must be from 20MHz continuous to 40GHz The specified antenna (Appendix 1.3.B) only supports frequencies down to 25MHz.  Is this an acceptable situation or will the contractor be required to add equipment to supp ort the 20  25MHz band?  Answer #7- The Doppler DF system antennae cover 88 MHz -1 GHz. This should be part of the GFE identified in question 1.02 above. Question #8-Appendix 1 2.  500 MHz instantaneous bandwidth.The specified Agilent suite only supports 36 MHz instantaneous bandwidth; is this adequate or will the contractor be required to add equipment to satisfy this requirement? Answer #8- 36 MHz instantaneous bandwidth is the minimu m adequate requirement.  500 MHz would be our preferred maximum.  Question #9-Appendix 1 2.  recording time of 10 seconds per signal capture. The specified Agilent suite only supports 8 seconds, is this adequate or will the contractor be required to add equipment to satisfy this requirement? Answer #9- 8 seconds exceed our minimum of 10 seconds required to capture and record a signal. Question #10- Appendix 1 2.  frequency resolution to 1 hertz. The specified Agilent suite only supports 8.5 Hz, is this adequate or will the contractor be required to add equipment to satisfy this requirement? Answer #10- 8.5 Hz is our minimum resolution and adequate. Frequency resolution to 1 Hertz is our maximum. The above Technical Questions and Answers may also be seen at and downloaded at: http://www.yuma.army.mil/site_contracting.asp.  2. All other terms and conditions remain as specified in the CSS.
