<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to perform market research for the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Stinger Night Sight (SNS).  The current manufacturer has announced that they will no longer produce the PAS-18 SNS.  Furthermore the current manufacturer will repair items only as long as current parts are in inventory.  The USMC SNS PAS-18 readiness will begin to degrade in the very near future.  It is the USMC desire to perform this market research to find a new commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solution to this requirement and gather cost information in order to formulate funding requests in the POM-04 budget.  

The following is the current requirements of the Stinger Night Sight:
	a.  The system will provide the capability to detect and recognize (as defined in Joint Publication 1-02 Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms) fixed and rotary wing aircraft within the effective range of the Stinger missile system.  The sight must enable the gunner to insert the same lead angles and super elevation as required by the Stinger missile system.  The system will not require any electrical interface with the Stinger missile system and must interface with the grip stock control group of the guided missile launcher presently in use by USMC LAAD units.  A simple snap on/pull off mechanical interface will be required, but must not interfere with the operation of the missile system or organic identification friend or foe.  The system must be fully capable of conducting worldwide operations in conventional and contingency combat operations including tactical nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare environments.
	b.  The system can be expected to be in actual operation for a range of twelve to twenty-four hours a day.  The average mission length will be 12 hours.
	c.  The system is required to provide for rapid and easy attachment and detachment to the Stinger missile system.  The system must not require modification to the missile system. 
	d.  The system is required to consist of a single unit with a self-contained power source ("common" standardized military battery) that will provide 10 hours (12 hours desired) of continuous operation (50% standby, 50% full on) without replacement.  For systems that do not use a standby mode, the off switch will be considered "standby".  The sight will energize to the full operational capability within ten seconds (three seconds desired) when the "on" switch is activated.  Different types of batteries are acceptable to meet normal and extreme temperature conditions.  Adapters for extreme weather conditions are acceptable.  The power source will be accessible without the use of tools. 
The possibility of using an adapter for vehicular power in addition to batteries is required. When vehicle power is used the sight is required to use standard vehicle power adapters. The power source must be capable of being replaced during conditions of darkness and while wearing environmental and/or protective clothing and equipment.  Rechargeable batteries for the system are not acceptable.  
e.  The SNS will be capable of being operated in all environmental conditions.  It will be capable of operating in temperatures ranging from -40.0 degrees Celsius to +51.67 degrees Celsius (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to +125 degrees Fahrenheit) and from 0% to 100% humidity.
	f.  The device must provide full operational capability within 90 seconds (required) from initial turn-on.   An initial turn on time of 10 seconds is desired.  Initial turn-on time is defined as the time required for the system to become energized "warm-up" and thus fully operational.  
	g.  The device will not interfere with the operation of the Stinger Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) transmitter/receiver.  Operation of the Stinger IFF will not interfere with the operation of the sight.
	h.  The SNS should be designed for use with mission oriented protective posture clothing class (4) and also compatible with current protective helmets and masks.  The system will possess a chemical and biological survivability capability equal to the Stinger missile system.  The sight should also be compatible with gunners wearing eyeglasses. The sight is not required to provide the ability to correct the vision of gunners who normally use eyeglasses, but choose not to when operating the SNS. 
	i.  When subjected to the effects of a nuclear blast, the SNS should be at least as survivable as the Marine operating the sight.
	j.  The system must be designed to allow improved resolution to increase detection and recognition ranges without increasing system weight and/or provide for weight reductions.
	k.  The SNS will be capable of being air delivered in its organic hard carrying case with the individual Marine during the assault phase of an airborne and/or amphibious operation.  The device will be capable of surviving environments associated with air drop (e.g. thermal shock, pressure change, moisture/ condensation penetration, shock and vibration).   
	l.  SNS will be lightweight 2.72 kilograms (six pounds) or less with a desired weight of 1.81 kilograms (four pounds) and will not restrict the employment of the Stinger missile system.   
	m.  The device will be sufficiently ruggedized to withstand and/or be protected from the abrasive effects (e.g. pitting and scratching) and the penetration of blowing sand and dust particles while operating.  The design of the system should also prohibit the penetration of water, moisture, condensation, and salt spray.
	n.  The device will comply with applicable safety, health and human engineering requirements and not present uncontrolled safety and health hazards to personnel.  As a minimum, the provisions of Military Standards 454, 882, and 1472 will apply to the system.
	o.  The device will provide maximum survivability in an electronic warfare environment without loss of mission performance.  The device will be protected from coherent light damage (non-laser), and the effects of electromagnetic interference.  It should have passive security against optical detection and should operate, without degradation, in an electro-optical countermeasures environment.
	p.  The system is required to be constructed from chemical and biological resistant materials/paints, which will facilitate decontamination and/or allow use of the device in a toxic environment.  The ability to decontaminate the device must be considered in the design (sealing, shape, and contour) of its outer surfaces.

	q.  Reliability:  550 hrs or greater Mean Time Between Operational Mission Failure.
	r.  Operational Availability:  95 percent.
	s.  Mean-Time to Repair will be no more than .5 hours with a 95% confidence level.
	t.  Expected distribution of unscheduled maintenance will be approximately one percent organizational, 95 percent intermediate, and 4 percent depot maintenance.  There will be no scheduled maintenance at echelons other than the organizational level.  The mean time to perform prevent maintenance will be five minutes (0.083 hours).            
	u.  The device should not require any special tools or equipment for operator tasks.  Built in test equipment or self-test circuitry may be incorporated.
	v.  Because of the nature and simplicity of the SNS system, operator level maintenance should be minimal.
	w.  The system does not require critical system characteristics for electronic protection and Wartime Reserve Modes.
	x.  Organizational maintenance will consist of self test, built-in-test, and fault isolation to obtain a go/no-go indication.
	y.  Intermediate level maintenance will fault isolate to the component/piece part level and will replace failed component piece as authorized.  Authorization is dependent on the availability of trained personnel and support equipment.
	z.  Depot level maintenance should conform to the level of repair analysis.  Contractor maintenance may be required.  Every effort should be made to accommodate 
integrated support concepts outlined in published military standards.
	aa.  The night sight should be capable of self-test.  Failures will be sent for Depot level repair.  All other breakages will be sent to ELMACO.  No repairs will be done at the unit level.
