This announcement is for a fixed-price design/build contract for construction of a new building of approximately 31,000 gross square feet to house laboratory, support services and administrative functions on the campus of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana.  This acquisition is being conducted on behalf of NIH by the Indian Health Service, Division of Engineering Services (IHS/DES) under an interagency agreement pursuant to the Economy Act.  The building footprint is nominally 68’x138’ with basement level, two full stories above ground, and a mechanical penthouse.  The exterior appearance and floor plans are defined.  The building is conceived as a steel frame structure with exterior combination of brick and metal panels.  The design and construction will include completion of all design details, connections to central campus systems (including steam, regular and emergency power, chilled water, communications, and security access), equipment requirements, finishes, and furnishings for a complete functional structure.  Specialized requirements include adherence to National Institutes of Health Design Guidelines, vibration isolation, noise mitigation and blast damage resistance.  The work includes demolition of three existing buildings, including one that occupies the new building site and two that will be demolished approximately 30 days after acceptance of the new building. The demolition will involve hazardous materials.  Offerors will be evaluated using Two-Phase Design/Build Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that will result in an award based on BEST VALUE to the Government, price and other factors considered.

Price and the overall technical rating are of approximately equal weight.  Evaluation of price may involve total price or evaluation of scope/design options within the published budget for award.  The phase two technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, small business subcontracting effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction.   Phase one of this solicitation will be issued on or about 17 April 2006 and will be posted on this website.  Phase two will be issued to the short listed offerors after evaluation of phase one responses. Firms formally organized as design-build entities or design firms and construction contractors that have associated specifically for this project may submit proposals. In the latter case, a single design firm or construction contractor may offer more than one proposal by entering into more than one such association.  This solicitation is being conducted on an unrestricted basis.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.   Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database in order to participate in this procurement (http://www.ccr.gov).

<CONTACT>Joe Carey, 202-267-3740
<DESC>The Senior Vice President for Finance (AJF-0) within the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) is responsible for financial management and oversight of the: â€¢	Facilities & Equipment (F&E) appropriation approximating $3 billion annually, as well as the â€¢	Research, Engineering& Development (RE&D) appropriation exceeding $100 million annually. To carry out its broad financial responsibilities, the FAA Office of Capital Expenditures Programs requires contractor support with highly specialized expertise in the areas of (a) program/technical support from an engineering or technology perspective; (b) budget and financial management and development; (c) systems engineering support; (d) cost accounting, accounting system (DELPHI), and Budget Execution Tool (BET) support; (e) financial systems and reporting; (f) financial studies and analyses; and (g) acquisition planning support.  In addition to the above, administrative support will be required for key management levels and offices within the ATO as well. The purpose of this announcement is to survey the market to ascertain the availability of viable competitors for this planned procurement, as well as solicit comments and/or concerns on our draft Statement of Work (SOW).  In addition to expressing interest on receiving a copy of the Screening Information Request (SIR), we also are requesting that you identify any unclear passages and/or forward any questions on our draft SOW you may have to the designated contact below.  This procurement will be a small business set-aside, resulting in the award of a cost plus award fee type, level-of-effort contract.  It will have a 3-year period of performance, with 2 additional one-year options.  Because of the high proportion of engineering analysis required, we plan to use North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541330, Engineering Services, to define eligible small businesses.  The NAICS code small business size standard is $25.0M.  Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.  We estimate that approximately 20-24 person years of effort will be needed annually. In addition to the above, other requirements that the successful offeror (and/or their team members) will be required to demonstrate during the solicitation are based on the following: 1.	Four years experience with ORACLE as it applies to federal financial systems.  (Experience with DELPHI will be given added emphasis by the FAA during the conduct of the procurement.) 2.	Because of the need for quick coordination on various tasks, an office for project staff within a 45-minute commute from FAA Headquarters, using public transportation (e.g., buses and/or Metro; no taxis). 3.	A thorough understanding of the FAA's National Airspace System (NAS), especially the Air Traffic Organization (ATO), its' organizational structure, and the nature of its operations. Please forward any questions and/or concerns you may have to Joe Carey, Office of Acquisitions, no later than June 29.  The FAA will not respond to most submittals, but in lieu thereof, will address the issues and concerns identified to achieve clarity in the Statement of Work before the SIR is released.  In addition, we may contact you to clarify your questions, if we are unsure of the nature of your inquiries.   Your submittals will be received at the following e-mail address: joe.carey@faa.gov Telephonic responses will not be accepted.

<DESC>The contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, materials, equipment, etc., to develop and deploy a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag detection system capable of interrogating tagged salmonids passing dams via spillways with and without RSWs.  The spillway at Bonneville Dam located on the lower Columbia River near Stevenson, Washington (none of the spillways at this dam has an RSW).  The general width of each spillway is 50 ft with water velocity exceeding 60 ft/per sec under the vertical rising spill gates under certain conditions.  The spill gates typically are opened 2-5 feet during spill.  Note the fish capture velocity is set at 15 ft/sec.  Also, RSWs have been or are being installed at Lower Granite (2001), Ice Harbor (2005), and Lower Monumental (2007) Dams on the lower Snake River.  Little Goose Dam is scheduled for RSW installation in 2009.  Since they fit into spillways, the width of RSWs is basically 50 feet and their downstream exit opening is approximately 3 feet high. It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price contract will be awarded.  Documents for the Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available on or about June 30, 2006, to download through the Government's website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  No paper copies will be issued.

<DESC>This follow-on BAA is for Phase 2 of the PMRF BPL effort.  The Phase 1 Concept Study consisted of two separate efforts to deliver alternate concept exploration, investigation and implementation of the PMRF BPL baseline effects model.  

It is the intent of the Government in Phase 2 to make one or more awards to perform one, two, or all of the following efforts: implement and support the integration testbed; investigate and implement data/sensor fusion and behavioral algorithms; and modify, adapt, install and integrate selected sensors.  There will only be one integrator selected to develop and test a single system on the base.  But it is anticipated that several ancillary awards will be made for specific sensors and behavioral analysis algorithms to be integrated into the single system.

It is the expectation of the Government that participants in Phase 2 will work with the testbed systems integrator and vice versa with standard non-disclosure agreements.  Data assertions must be made per Section F of the Technical Proposal instructions.

Note: No contractor selected for the award of Phase 1 is restricted from participation in the competition of the additional Phases under this or any resultant follow-on BAA or RFP.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory,  Sensors Directorate (AFRL/PKSE ) solicits research proposals to support Non-Traditional Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (NT-ISR) capabilities and concepts on tactical platforms and the need to transmit NT-ISR products in a timely manner.  The proposed Radar Common Data Link (R-CDL) program will accomplish this via development, laboratory test and demonstration, followed by flight test and demonstration.  Upon successful completion of laboratory and flight test/demonstrations, it is anticipated that the developed capability will participate in a Government sponsored Joint exercise such as the Joint Expeditionary Force Experiment (JEFX).  More traditional communication systems or techniques are not part of this proposed effort.

The program will be partitioned into a Basic Effort with two priced Options.  The Basic Effort is comprised of development, System of Systems analysis, including R-CDL specifications, and a laboratory test/demonstration.  Option 1 is a flight test/demonstration and Option 2 is participation in a Government sponsored test such as JEFX.

<SUBJECT>D -- NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD TO MODIFY CPDSS, IT MAINTENANCE
<SOLNBR>FA8734-06-F-0003
<CONTACT>George Garten george.garten.ctr@randolph.af.mil
<DESC>Subject:  D---ELSG/PNK formally announces the intent to award a sole source task order FA873406F0003 to Lucent Technologies, under GSA contract-035F-0429L for approximately $2.2 million; basic performance period and two-1 year options.  To meet mission requirements, the objective of this acquisition is to enhance Air Force civilian personnel management by streamlining and consolidating functional activities, standardizing personnel applications, data, and systems and providing the customer with reengineered, user-friendly automated tools.  To accomplish this, the Air Force reengineered the delivery of certain civilian personnel processes resulting in the creation of several unique information systems to more efficiently manage the delivery of these civilian personnel services.  One of those systems is the Civilian Personnel Decision Support System (CPDSS).  Support is needed to provide system maintenance by (1) fixing broken routines in the CPDSS application as identified by the Air force within a timeframe commensurate with the importance and complexity of the broken routine and (2) modifying CPDSS application code as necessary to continue dynamic interaction between CPDSS and each of the Oracle HR application, Resumix, and the Experience History database, and (3) development of new functionality (enhancements) and other work ad directed by the Air Force in support CPDSS. Justification for this follow-on contract is FAR 6-302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  These services are deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of an anticipated follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized services.  The period of time required to perform a source selection as well as the ramp-up time required for a new contractor to become familiar with the program and technical issues would cause an unacceptable schedule delay in fulfilling the agency's requirements for support of system maintenance and a substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition due to the complexity level required to maintain the system until the Personnel Services Delivery Integration initiative is acquired.  The basic period of performance is approximately 3 months and 2 one year options. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all interested persons that identify to the contracting officer their intent and capabilities to satisfy the government's requirement with commercial services items and are received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service or the manufacturer meets qualifications requirements at time of award, in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1 or 52.209-2. An ESC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  Before consulting the ombudsman concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  In addition, AFFARS 5352.201-9101, OMBUDSMAN, will be included in this acquisition's solicitation and contract.  The ESC OMBUDSMAN is the ESC director, Commander's staff, and can be contacted at:  ESC/DC Bldg 1606  9 Eglin street, Hanscom AFB MA 01731 Telephone 781-377-5106 Facsimile 781-377-4569 E-Mail: esc.ombudsman@hanscom.af.mil.

<DESC>CONTACT Michael E. Harris, Senior Logistics Engineer, 732-532-2453. This is a broad, community-specific market survey to locate sources for supply of numerous avionics items that are currently in short supply within the Army and are needed immediatel y to support Army Aviation. In many cases, OEM suppliers are unable to produce sufficient quantities to meet our current needs. Thus, we are interested in buying assets from alternative sources. Depending upon specific circumstances for the items in questi on, we might be interested in buying new stock, new old stock, reconditioned items, or, in some cases, unserviceable items. In some cases, this material may have been purchased by suppliers as surplus equipment. Depending upon respondents capabilities and  the current status of our organic depot repair programs, we might be interested in having the supplier perform refurbishment/repair/overhaul. Alternatively, we might want to buy the unserviceable assets and induct these into ongoing organic repair program s that are operating below capacity because of the longstanding paucity of unserviceable returns from the field. Regardless of specific circumstances, any company that possesses ANY significant quantity of Army avionics is encouraged to respond with inform ation regarding those assets that they have available. We have a list of key NSNs of interest that will be provided via e-mail upon request. We are looking for hardware assets, not repair services. Companies capable of performing this effort may respond by  writing to: Commander, USA CECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-CCS-N-AN (MICHAEL E. HARRIS), Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5403 or alternatively, contact us via e-mail at: EMAIL ADDRESS avionics@mail1.monmouth.army.mil.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center New Orleans, on behalf of Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education Information Technology/Information Management Division, intends to modify contract N00140-06-C-0008 with Science Application International Corporation (SAIC). The modification will provide for 3 additional months of research and development and information technology support services for the Electronic Military Personnel Records System (EMPRS) program.  The 3 month extension will serve as a bridge vehicle until a new competitively awarded follow-on task order can be issued against the Navy's SeaPort vehicle. Support to the EMPRS program includes computer operations and message center support, system administration, data base administration, application configuration and support, information and network security support, help desk support, and legacy network support.  This includes a document imaging production operation, and record correction and customer support services, for the repository of over 3.5 million permanent personnel records. Additionally, support is required to provide Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI), legacy Local Area Network (LAN), and systems technical operations for MPT&E. This support is for hardware and software at the NAVPERSCOM Network Control Center (NCC) located in Millington and at the Liaison Detachment at the Navy Annex in Washington, DC.   Support is also required for BUPERS On-Line  (BOL) which hosts over forty manpower and personnel applications.  BOL is the system that will allow the sailor in the future to review their personnel record on line. The Government intends to issue a request for proposal to SAIC.  Questions pertaining to this acquisition should be addressed to Mr. Ed Wallace at  (504) 697-7003 or email ed.wallace1@navy.mil within 45 days of the initial posting of this announcement.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisition Center (COAC), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital-Abuth, PMB 1026 Shika Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria, to provide clinical research support services for the Prevalence of Secondary Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease in Nigeria and the Role of HIV/AIDS and Endemic Parasitic Infections in the Natural History of Pulmonary Hypertension in Sickle Cell Disease study.   Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder and the most common genetic disease in the world.  It is the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States, affecting more than 70,000 Americans resulting in significant physical and psychosocial morbidity and premature mortality.   A major organ complication of SCD is secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).  Many known infectious risk factors for  (PAH) are also highly prevalent in Nigeria, including Human Immuno Deficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS), malaria, chronic hepatitis B and C, schistosomiasis and hookworm.  The overall goal of this project is to determine the prevalence of secondary, pulmonary hypertension in Nigerian patients with sickle cell anemia.  The project aims to determine the prevalence of HIV, malaria, hepatitis B and C, schistosomiasis and hookworm in Nigerian patients with sickle cell anemia, and the interaction of HIV, malaria, hepatitis B and C, schistosomiasis, hookworm, and sickle cell anemia in (PAH) in Nigerian patients with sickle cell anemia.  And to confirm a genetic diagnosis for sickle â-globin syndromes and á-thalassemia syndromes in this cohort as a point of reference for future genotype-phenotype studies, and  using both candidate gene and genome wide association approaches, NHLBI along with ABUTH will identify and selectively characterize single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes important for endothelial function and vascular inflammation, and identifying genetic proteomic risk factors associated with pulmonary hypertension in SCA using this study’s genotyping approaches.  

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital(ABUTH) in Zaria, Nigeria is the only known source that is currently able to assist the NIH, NHLBI, Vascular Medicine Branch in this area of research.  An award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  

The expected period of performance is one (1) year from the date of the award.

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirement of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6, Competition Requirements.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is

<DESC>BACKGROUND
A major challenge in cancer research, including the sequencing of “cancer genes,” lies in its immense complexity. The many different tumor types, each with distinct subtypes, present radically different scientific and clinical challenges. This heterogeneity is in part understood to be related to the dynamic state of the cancer genome and the fact that tumors are complex systems characterized by chromosomal aberrations and nucleotide mutations, by their cellular and biological context and character, and by environmental influences. While certain similarities exist across various forms of cancer, a comprehensive effort to characterize tumor genomes must address the issue of heterogeneity systematically. Consequently, a cancer genome project needs to be multi-institutional, multi-sector, and inter-disciplinary to be successful.
In 2004, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) convened a workshop to consider a project to identify the full set of genetic changes in cancer, as an important step toward the NCI’s 2015 Challenge Goal of the elimination of suffering and death due to cancer. In the same year, Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach, Director, NCI requested that a working group of the National Cancer Advisory Board (NCAB) evaluate the status of advanced technologies in the context of NCI’s challenge goal. This subcommittee presented a series of recommendations to the NCAB that included a proposed genomic characterization and re-sequencing project that would be initiated through a pilot program and subsequently scaled up depending on the outcome of the first phase (http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/Advisory/ncab/sub-bt/NCABReport_Feb05.pdf). Based on the recommendations from the report, the Directors of the NCI and the NHGRI agreed to pursue a three year pilot cancer genome characterization and sequencing project to determine the feasibility of a large-scale effort to identify most of the genomic changes associated with the wide array of diseases called “cancer.” The project was subsequently named The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
The aims of the 3-year pilot project are to demonstrate that a reasonably complete genomic characterization of a small number (two or more) of organ site specific tumor types and re-sequencing of selected targets can be efficiently and cost-effectively achieved; and to identify genes and/or regions of interest by combining information from genome analysis technologies and tumor biology (cancergenome.nih.gov). If successful, the results from the pilot program will provide both the basis for genomic analysis of a larger number of tumors, and generate a large set of data that will inform and benefit individual investigator-initiated studies to identify new targets for intervention, patient stratification in therapy, and possibly even prevention. Successful completion of TCGA pilot project, namely the achievement of established success factors and milestones to attain clinical impact, will be required before the concept of an expanded “production phase” can begin to rapidly and efficiently generate a genomic “atlas” for all major cancer types.
Based on the NCAB Subcommittee’s recommendations and broad input from the scientific community, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) agreed to support The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pilot Project (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/). A joint staff-level planning and management structure for the project, the TCGA Project Management Group, has developed an overall approach and plan for the pilot project based on the NCAB Working Group Report on Biomedical Technology (http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/Advisory/ncab/sub-bt/NCABReport_Feb05.pdf) and two workshops: Exploring Cancer through Genomic Sequence Comparisons (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Info/genomic_comparison) and Toward a Comprehensive Genomic Analysis of Cancer (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Info/TCGA_executive_summary.pdf).  The overarching goal of the TCGA Pilot Project is to leverage the existing infrastructure, extant knowledge bases, and resources of the NCI and the NHGRI to conduct the high-throughput analysis of tumor genes and regions , from highly defined and annotated human cancer biospecimens of the highest quality. 
  Genes and regions will be chosen based on the analysis and integration of data from multiple genome analysis platforms and informed by the context of the cancer biology conducted in Cancer Genome Characterization Centers.
The key programmatic components of TCGA include: a biospecimen core resource (BCR); cancer genome characterization centers (CGCCs); genome sequencing centers (GSCs); a data coordinating center (DCC); technology development; and community portals. A schematic representation of the TCGA project is shown at http://cancergenome.nih.gov/media/process.asp.  This SOW describes the requirements for the data coordinating center (DCC) component of the TCGA program. 
The DCC will be expected to adopt and implement systems and standards from the NCI’s Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG™) program (http://cabig.nci.nih.gov).  caBIG™ aims to create a broad federated network of interoperable biomedical information systems. The requirements for interoperability are defined in the caBIG™ Compatibility Guidelines, which can be found https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/guidelines_documentation.  Detailed requirements for caBIG Compatibility are given in TASKS below.
OBJECTIVES
This statement of work (SOW) describes four major objectives:  
•	In collaboration with representatives from TCGA data collection centers, including Genome Sequencing Centers (GSCs), Cancer Genome Characterization Centers (CGCCs), and Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR), establish and execute standard operating procedures for data transmission to the Data Coordinating Center.  
•	Design and implement data analysis procedures that perform quality checks on incoming data and report anomalies to the data source sites.  
•	Implement a data management pipeline to process data and prepare it for public distribution in formats 	and systems that are consistent with compatibility guidelines defined by the caBIG™ program. 
•	Post the processed data to the publicly accessible distribution points immediately after quality checks and processing are completed. 
OVERALL TASKS
The Contractor shall furnish the National Cancer Institute with professional service experts to create and support the activities of the TCGA Data Coordinating Center. These experts will work directly with representatives from other TCGA program centers to establish and execute program-wide procedures for data transmission, quality assurance checks, compliance with requirements for adoption of data standards, and other requirements related to the management, processing, aggregation, and distribution of TCGA program data. The Contractor staff will raise issues, conduct discussions, perform analyses, make recommendations, forge consensus, produce documentation, implement processes, and use their skills to achieve the Objectives of this SOW.  The experts are expected to have knowledge and past experience with life science data analysis and management, including data from clinical annotations, tissue pathology reports, genetics, genomics and gene expression. Experience with high throughput methods for data quality analysis and compliance with data standards will be essential.  
Two categories of software are anticipated to be needed to carry out the tasks in this SOW.  The first category includes scripts and programs to support data processing, analysis, and transformation, quality checks, and reporting.  The Contractor will be expected to re-use existing public scripts, programs and software tools to carry out these functions, and develop new scripts, programs and tools as needed. Since this category of software is for internal processing purposes only, it is not expected to conform to caBIG™ interoperability standards, though the data that is disseminated by the DCC will be need to be compliant (see “caBIG Compatibility for Data Sets”, Section 7, below).
The second category of software includes data management systems to support public access to the data after it has been fully processed by the DCC.  This category of software will be expected to conform to caBIG™ compatibility guidelines at the Silver level of compatibility. The DCC is expected to adopt existing caBIG compliant software systems that are currently being hosted at the NCI Center for Bioinformatics (NCICB).  In cases where the NCICB is not already hosting a needed system, an existing caBIG™-compatible product with suitable functionality should be adopted and instantiated.  These existing caBIG™-compatible software products may need to be extended to support TCGA requirements, in which case the Contractor shall leverage the caBIG™ development methodology and tools associated with the caCORE Software Development Kit (SDK), which can be found at http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/NCICB/infrastructure/cacoresdk.   Entirely new software systems in this category are not in scope for this SOW.  
Any software developed with funding under this project must be released under an open-source license that complies with caBIG™ licensing guidelines https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/working_groups/DSIC_SLWG/index_html/document_view
The DCC may also deposit certain data types in non-caBIG™ public repositories, such as those hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).  Decisions about deposition in such non-caBIG repositories will be made in conjunction with the COTR and with NCI and NHGRI TCGA program management.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Specialized requirements include adherence to National Institutes of Health Design Guidelines, vibration isolation, noise mitigation and blast damage resistance.  The work includes demolition of three existing buildings, including one that occupies the new building site and two that will be demolished approximately 30 days after acceptance of the new building. The demolition will involve hazardous materials.  Offerors will be evaluated using Two-Phase Design/Build Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that will result in an award based on BEST VALUE to the Government, price and other factors considered.

To carry out its broad financial responsibilities, the FAA Office of Capital Expenditures Programs requires contractor support with highly specialized expertise in the areas of (a) program/technical support from an engineering or technology perspective; (b) budget and financial management and development; (c) systems engineering support; (d) cost accounting, accounting system (DELPHI), and Budget Execution Tool (BET) support; (e) financial systems and reporting; (f) financial studies and analyses; and (g) acquisition planning support.  In addition to the above, administrative support will be required for key management levels and offices within the ATO as well. The purpose of this announcement is to survey the market to ascertain the availability of viable competitors for this planned procurement, as well as solicit comments and/or concerns on our draft Statement of Work (SOW).  In addition to expressing interest on receiving a copy of the Screening Information Request (SIR), we also are requesting that you identify any unclear passages and/or forward any questions on our draft SOW you may have to the designated contact below.  This procurement will be a small business set-aside, resulting in the award of a cost plus award fee type, level-of-effort contract.  It will have a 3-year period of performance, with 2 additional one-year options.  Because of the high proportion of engineering analysis required, we plan to use North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541330, Engineering Services, to define eligible small businesses.  The NAICS code small business size standard is $25.0M.  Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.  We estimate that approximately 20-24 person years of effort will be needed annually. In addition to the above, other requirements that the successful offeror (and/or their team members) will be required to demonstrate during the solicitation are based on the following: 1.	Four years experience with ORACLE as it applies to federal financial systems.  (Experience with DELPHI will be given added emphasis by the FAA during the conduct of the procurement.) 2.	Because of the need for quick coordination on various tasks, an office for project staff within a 45-minute commute from FAA Headquarters, using public transportation (e.g., buses and/or Metro; no taxis). 3.	A thorough understanding of the FAA's National Airspace System (NAS), especially the Air Traffic Organization (ATO), its' organizational structure, and the nature of its operations. Please forward any questions and/or concerns you may have to Joe Carey, Office of Acquisitions, no later than June 29.  The FAA will not respond to most submittals, but in lieu thereof, will address the issues and concerns identified to achieve clarity in the Statement of Work before the SIR is released.  In addition, we may contact you to clarify your questions, if we are unsure of the nature of your inquiries.   Your submittals will be received at the following e-mail address: joe.carey@faa.gov Telephonic responses will not be accepted.

DoS overseas telephone network includes more than 550 telephone systems currently in operation worldwide with the program office FPT located in Springfield, Virginia. FPT through its JANUS Program is in the process of standardizing overseas telephone equipment by maintaining the legacy Nortel Networks Meridian 1 Digital communications systems and installing the Nortel Communication Server product line.  The Meridian 1 and Communication Server is capable of meeting transmission requirements worldwide and providing a Transfer Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)-enabled switch management system.  The current NMSS environment uses the Nortel Optivity Telephony Manager (OTM). This is accomplished through (TCP/IP)-based monitoring and maintenance of post Private Branch Exchange’s (PBX) using connections via the DoS OpenNet.  When the post PBX is configured for IP management utilizing the OTM application, FPT is able to provide remote terminal emulation, event logging, alarm monitoring, PBX maintenance and password management. These features generated by the PBX are transmitted to the monitoring DoS facility, State Annex 21 (SA-21).

The NMSS will support the management of the overseas telephone network through timely and accurate coordination of all interactions with the DoS Enterprise Network Management Operations Center (ENMOC) to ensure that Service Level Agreement (SLA) objectives are achieved in a timely and cost-effective manner 
Question:  What are the SLA objectives?

The overall objectives of the NMSS is to:  (1) perform a critical, centralized, customer-centric coordination function, (2) technical assistance, and (3) provide superior customer support services to DoS, external customers, stakeholders, and technical assistance, as required either at SA-21 or an off-site contractor facility that meets the DoS security requirements. Specific requirements for this RFI are described below.

DoS is seeking an integrated NMSS solution/capability that can be leveraged department wide and provide tangible value to all FPT customers.  Responses should include information on scalability, capabilities to operate in a distributed, decentralized, and multi-tied environments.

FPT is exploring better ways to implement a NMSS. The purpose of the NMSS will be to (1) perform a critical, centralized, customer-centric coordination function, (2) technical assistance, and (3) provide superior customer support services to overseas posts, external customers, stakeholders, and technical assistance, (4) provide the lowest overall total cost of ownership, (5) provide best in practice quality of service, (6) provide configuration management. 

In terms of functionality, DoS is seeking an integrated NMSS solution that will significantly improve DoS’s ability to manage all its assets throughout their lifecycle.  This should include the ability to track, monitor, and report on assets at overseas posts from initial installation through final disposal.  The NMSS should assist DoS in management of network resources to proactively manage the environment to ensure sustained operational capabilities.  The NMSS should combine existing data sources/functionality with new capabilities.  It should also provide a mechanism for consolidated reporting and analysis to enable an enterprise view of telecommunications assets, resources, and operational effectiveness. 

Requirements:

FPT has identified 6 key NMSS areas (1) Network Management, (2) Level 2 Customer Support Services, (3) Systems Administration, (4) Continuity of Operations support, (5) Core Network Services where an integrated NMSS could provide significant operational improvements, (6) Configuration Management.  However, discussions/responses should not be limited to these key areas, if the respondents perceive gaps in the DoS approach to the overall NMSS, recommendations are strongly encouraged.  A key goal of the NMSS is to ensure the operational effectiveness of DoS overseas telephone network through the implementation of “Best Practices’ and the recognition that DoS must continually address emerging technologies.  The requirements described in this RFI are high-level functional and technical requirements that should be tightly integrated into the final solution.  Wherever possible, DoS seeks responses/solutions from an enterprise-wide perspective that will maximize DoS’s JANUS investments. Responses to these requirements should include specific details for each area and recommendations of additional requirements, if required.  

The requirements are: 

1.	Network Management

DoS is seeking an integrated Network Management solution that will provide (1) Performance Management, (2) Fault Management, (3) Security Management, (4) Configuration Management, and (5) Accounting Management for all JANUS assets and resources. The solution should provide a description of the technical approach, methodologies, tools, and services required to implement a compliant Service Level Management framework in the current and future operational environment. Essential to this requirement is the need to clearly demonstrate the correlation between current network management and Information Technology Infrastructure Library ‘Best Practices’ methodologies, tools, services, and products. Inconsistencies and potential risks with different implementations should also be described. 

2.	Level 2 Customer Support Services

DoS is seeking an integrated Customer Support Services (CSS) solution that will provide a full suite of compliant Service Level Management services and support. This solution will include, but not limited, to establishing and maintaining an on-site/off-site Level-2 CSS on a (24x7x365). Essential to this requirement is the need to clearly demonstrate the correlation between the network management, Information Technology Infrastructure Library ‘Best Practices’ methodologies, tools, services, and products, and Customer Support Services. Inconsistencies and potential risks with different implementations should also be described. 


3.	Systems Administration

DoS is seeking a solution that will provide hardware and software configuration management and security management on the legacy Meridian platform and current/future Nortel Communications Server platforms.

<DESC>This is the third amendment to Solicitation N00178-06-R-3034 posted to Federal Business Opportunities on 18 April 2006.  This requirement is for a Firm Fixed-Price contract for the acquisition of two (2) complete Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) and any Ground Control System (GCS) components, other than standard personal computers, that are required to operate both UAVs simultaneously in an autonomous manner.  This requirement is set aside 100 percent for participation by small business concerns.  Note 1 will apply.  This amendment adds the following wording:  “The subject UAVs will be used strictly for research and development, contributing to the investigation of autonomous group behaviors and swarming. They will not be used in a war zone.  Consequently, militarily hardened UAVs and/or related components are not required, reflect efforts outside of the scope of this acquisition and in all likelihood are prohibitively expensive.  Likewise, UAVs and/or related components t!  hat significantly exceed the specifications stated herein are not required and in all likelihood prohibitively expensive.”  This amendment revises the Description (specifications) of the UAVs by adding underlined wording as follows:  DESCRIPTION:  A. UAV Requirements:  1.  General Flight Requirements: The UAVs shall be capable of powered flight and shall be capable of a rolling launch from a paved 500 ft. runway and/or launched from a moving vehicle (the said vehicle to be an existing Government vehicle such as a standard pickup truck), with a full payload and fuel load.  The UAVs shall also have an autonomous landing capability on a paved, 500 ft. runway, with a full payload and fuel load.  The UAV shall be capable of a rate of climb equal to 333 ft/min on a day with 80% relative humidity, and 85 degree F, ambient temperature. The UAV shall be capable of sustained level flight at not less than 1000 feet, with not more than 75% throttle.  The UAV shall have available payloa!  d capacity of at least twenty pounds at maximum take-off weight.  The  available payload capacity shall be at least 1400 cu. in., and two dimensions of the payload cavity (i.e., length vs. width, length vs. height, width vs. height) shall have an aspect ration in excess of 2 to 1.  The payload cavity shall be accessible from the bottom of the UAV with removal of simple fasteners. The payload bay shall provide attachment points, space, and power for installing an existing BAI Aero Systems Mini-66 type sensor that the Government owns.  The UAVs shall each be equipped with landing gear that provides clearance of at least four inches between the bottom of the installed Mini-66 type sensor and the ground at maximum compression of the landing struts/rigging.   Auxiliary space of .75 ft3 and 300 Watts of 12 VDC power shall be provided for the Government-installed equipment.  The UAV shall be capable of carrying enough fuel and have sufficient battery power to provide a flight duration of at least 90 minutes with a full, 20 lb. payload (or a 20 lb. bal!  last weight) installed.  2.  Video and Communications Requirements: The UAV shall have a fixed focal length, forward-looking, auto iris video camera with at least 1024 X 1024 pixel 16-bit color resolution. The camera shall be oriented to provide a forward-looking (Pilot’s) view and shall be capable of 70 degrees in azimuth and elevation in reference to the aircraft centerline.  The UAV video shall be transmitted to and displayed on the GCS on a radio frequency in any of the commercial or shared frequency bands between 902 and 10005 Mhz.  Each UAV shall transmit its video on a separate channel to avoid cross talk of the two video signals.  The UAV shall have a full duplex command and control transceiver operating in any of the commercial or shared frequency bands between 902 and 10005 Mhz. This transceiver shall receive and transmit data to and from an equivalent transceiver supplied by the vendor as part of the GCS equipment. The transceiver pair, with vendor supplied anten!  nas, shall be capable of at least a 10-mile line of sight range in cle ar weather.  3.

The autopilots shall be capable of in-flight waypoint programming in order to support ground based UAV flight path control.  The autopilot shall also perform error checking on newly received waypoints from the GCS prior to application and/or execution. If an error is detected by the autopilot on receipt of a waypoint set update, the autopilot shall not implement the received waypoint set and shall transmit an error message to the GCS.  Each autopilot shall be capable of transmitting the UAV’s current GPS position, its current speed setting, heading, and altitude setting to the GCS at least once every two seconds.  Additional data transmis!  sion to the GCS is also acceptable.  The autopilot shall also be outfitted with a standard, 72 - 73 Mhz, radio control receiver so that emergency control from a ground based operator using a standard Futaba like radio, can be achieved at short ranges.  In the event of a communications failure between the UAV and the GCS, the UAV shall be capable of executing a pre-planned, pre-defined maneuver, autonomously. The maneuver capability shall include an autonomous landing capability at the takeoff point, or at another pre-defined point. The pre-planned maneuver shall be capable of being loaded into the UAV autopilot prior to takeoff.  The UAV shall utilize a dual-frequency (L1 and L2), active GPS antenna with a minimum 40-db gain.  The autopilot shall provide at least one RS-232 pass through for use by the customer as a payload control channel.   This amendment also extends the closing date for offers to 21 JUNE 2006, no later than 2:00 local time.   Fax copies are acceptable, f!  ax # 540 653-6810 or e-mail to DLGR_NSWC_XDS13@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>20--Manufacturer Oil-Water separators and/or Oil pollution abatement systems
<SOLNBR>N6554006SCAM2
<RESPDATE>080106
<CONTACT>Steven Lehman, Code 631, email: steven.lehman@navy.mil Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock PNBC-Bldg. 1000 Attn: Steven Lehman, P.E. 5101 South 18th Street Philadelphia, PA 19112-5083 PLEASE EMAIL ALL QUESTIONS. NO TELEPHONE REQUEST WILL BE ACCEPTED.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, Philadelphia, PA (NSWCCD-SSES, Code 631) is soliciting manufacturers of oil-water separators and/or oil pollution abatement systems that would be interested to partner, further develop, and commercialize NSWCCD’s design for an automatic oil pollution abatement system (AOPA). The jointly developed automatic oil pollution abatement system would include: 1) The automatic Oily Waste Transfer System (AOWT); 2) Primary Oil-Water Separator System (Gravity Unit); 3) Secondary Treatment System (Ceramic Membrane Ultrafiltration Unit). The overall goals of the planned Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) are as follows: 1) Establish a cooperative agreement and then a manufacturing license agreement with an interested partner, to develop and supply the AOPA System and support one-stop-shopping for shipbuilding customers; 2) Develop system modules, options that may include variable process rates, and customize the Programmable Logic Controller’s software (PLC –based main controllers); 3) Develop a completely integrated AOPA System that uses the AOWT system, a gravity OWS with automatic and diagnostic operational controls, qualified materials and field devices, and a secondary treatment system with a by-pass option; 4) Develop smaller capacity oil–water separator systems  (e.g., 5 gpm, 10 gpm, and 25 gpm) with a primary unit based upon the NSWCC-SSES OWS control and design architecture, and a qualified secondary unit operation, which would be integrated to the overall automatic OPA  “smart” !  system; 5)  Design, develop, test, and incorporate improvements into the AOPA system based on NAVSEA in-service engineering (ISEA) knowledge base, and partner experience; 6) Simplify AOPA System logistics for U.S. Naval Ships; and 7) Finalize partnering and financial obligation issues, and review the transfer of intellectual property and statement of work that addresses responsibilities for tasks.  In summary, the automated oily waste transfer (AOWT) system has been designed and developed to provide a fully automated, smart system that addresses known shortcomings, limitations, problems, and safety issues that are either well recognized, or may not be readily apparent, for existing manually operated Navy (and potentially commercial) shipboard oily waste transfer systems. In addition, the primary oil-water separator (OWS) will support the fully integrated oil pollution abatement (OPA) system. The envisioned OWS would be a programmable logic controller (PLC)-based, multi-staged shipboard environmental system that automatically manages and processes shipboard generated oily wastewater from an oily waste holding tank (OWHT) to ultimately discharge clean water overboard while retaining separated bulk waste oil in a waste oil tank (WOT). The qualified OWS system(s) would include the gravity separator, a secondary polisher unit, and an oil content monitor unit.  Moreover, whi!  le the joint developmental work would be based upon the NSWCCD system developed (Model VS-50R, 50 gpm capacity), the CRADA partner is completely free to substitute any primary O/W separator that meets our reliability requirements and other qualifications.  Interested parties are requested to submit technical design and manufacturing experience for oil pollution abatement (OPA) systems, principal staff capabilities, product types currently manufactured and system qualifications, list of customers, and points of contact information. Submittals to be no more than 5 pages in length. Responses to this synopsis shall be sent to: Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, Code 631, PNBC, Bldg. 1000, Attn: Steven B. Lehman, P.E., 5101 South 18th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19112-5083. If this information is available online, send the web address to steven.lehman@navy.mil.  This synopsis is for information purposes only to identify potential Navy Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) partners. It does not constitute an RFQ and does not obligate the Government in any way to purchase any of the systems to be offered.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) hereby issues this synopsis for commercial item services for food services and cafeteria management for the TSA cafeteria located at 701 South 12th Street in Arlington, Virginia.  This facility services TSA’s employees, contractors and guests, and is not open to the general public.  The TSA intends to solicit technical proposals and award a no-cost contract for these services by mid-August of 2006.  

The incumbent Contractor for this effort is the Department for the Blind and Vision Impaired.  Although there is an incumbent, the TSA will consider and encourages innovative and creative approaches to meeting the agency’s requirements for the cafeteria.

The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued on June 22, 2006.  This is a full and open RFP and all interested companies are invited to participate regardless of business size.  Those interested parties may contact Quyen Diep via email at Quyen.Diep@dhs.gov for a copy of the RFP.

<SOLNBR>06CR39-NoSolicitation
<RESPDATE>063006
<ARCHDATE>06152007
<CONTACT>MARILYN J. HUTCHISON PURCHASING AGENT 3032369321     mhutchi@usgs.gov;
<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services and supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 15 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, National Geomagnetism Program, has a requirement for services to provide web-based graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to facilitate the in-house monitoring of its data acquisition systems. These GUIs must utilize existing Earthworm protocols developed by the USGS Seismology Program, and must interface onto existing Seismology and Geomagnetism Program database systems.  Specialized experience is needed in order to ensure a tidy interface and standardization with the existing software infrastructure.  Extensive knowledge of and experience with developing real-time software for geomagnetic data display is required; in particular, previous experience working with SCNL coding, Earthworm protocols, and Earthworm waveservers is imperative in order to achieve standardization in database development between the Seismology and Geomagnetism Programs.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the services and supplies specified as a sole source from Instrumental Software Technologies, Inc., 77 Van Dam Street, Saratoga Springs, New York, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.

<DESC>I. INTRODUCTION

The Department of State, Foreign Service Institute is the federal government’s primary training facility for personnel of the foreign affairs community.  FSI also provides training for employees of the Department of State and other agencies.  FSI offers more than 425 courses. The Institute is comprised of a number of schools/centers that include the School of Professional and Area Studies, the School of Language Studies, the School of Leadership and Management, the School of Applied Information Technology, and the Transition Center.

The School of Professional and Area Studies orients new State Department and other USG employees to the foreign affairs environment; provides high-quality job-related training for Foreign and Civil Service personnel in the Administrative Management, Consular, Economic, Political, and Public Diplomacy areas; improves the professional skills and abilities of Department of State Office Management Specialists and Office Support Personnel; enhances functional and management skills of the Foreign Service National staff; and provides employees of foreign affairs agencies knowledge about foreign countries and regions and an understanding of American interests and policies related to those countries and regions.

Orientation Division  (FSI/SPAS/OR)
The Orientation Division offers seven different courses ranging in length from two days to seven weeks for new Foreign Service and Civil Service employees, Foreign Service Officers returning to Washington, D.C. for their first domestic tour, and employees of other USG agencies. The courses for new Foreign Service Generalist and Specialist employees introduce them to the Foreign Service environment and prepare them for their first overseas or domestic assignments. The mandatory 9-day course for new Civil Service employees orients them to the organization and culture of the Department of State. The mandatory Washington Tradecraft course for officers assigned to their first domestic tour provides information and develops skills needed to function effectively in the Washington context. Short courses, such as Working in an Embassy which has an in-class and an on-line version, are offered to employees of other USG agencies being assigned to an overseas mission.

Administrative Management Training (FSI/SPAS/AMT)
The Administrative Management Training division prepares employees to serve in missions abroad and in the Department of State through courses in Administrative Management Operations, Financial Management Operations, General Services Operations and Acquisition and Human Resources Management.

Consular Training (FSI/SPAS/CON)
The Consular Training division provides basic instruction in consular operations in a simulated consular environment. CON also offers advanced consular studies, fraud prevention for consular managers, duty officer training, automation, analytic interviewing and advanced name-checking training for consular managers, along with twelve sessions per year of week-long workshops at FSI for consular FSN personnel, and five overseas workshops for consular officers.

Economic and Commercial Training (FSI/SPAS/ECON)
The Economic and Commercial Training Division trains employees to function effectively in economic jobs abroad and in the Department of State and other USG agencies. Economic training programs range from twenty-two short, specialized courses to a nine-month program delivering the equivalent of a strong B.S. degree in economics along with a heavy dose of applied economics. Specialized courses focus on trade issues and dispute resolution, aviation, telecommunications, energy, terrorist financing, intellectual property rights and biotechnology. Three tradecraft programs with multiple offerings each prepare officers for a first assignment in economic and political sections; commercial work; and environment, science and technology. There is also a course on applied economics for non-economic officers. Two long-term university graduate training slots are also available.

Political Training (FSI/SPAS/POL)
The primary mission of the Political Training Division (POL) is to train Foreign Service, Civil Service, Foreign Service National and other U.S. government employees to represent United States government interests both abroad and in Washington.  POL conducts Tradecraft courses to train entry-level Foreign Service officers for their initial assignments, and offers courses to mid-level officers in a wide-range of relevant subjects:  political-military affairs, global issues, human rights, arms control, nonproliferation, international negotiation skills, multilateral diplomacy, congressional relations, intelligence and foreign policy, combating terrorism, labor officer skills, and orientation courses for the PRM, INL, and Legislative Affairs bureaus.  The Division also features training for selected Foreign Service National employees to represent American objectives in their respective Embassies.

Public Diplomacy Training 
(FSI/SPAS/PD)
The Public Diplomacy Training division prepares employees to serve overseas as Public Affairs Officers, Cultural Affairs Officers and Information Officers and, in Washington D.C., as Public Diplomacy Officers. Officers learn how to apply Public Diplomacy resources to advance foreign policy objectives. Offerings include courses on media relations, professional and academic exchange programs, VIP visits, responses to crisis situations, and the administration of grants and other PD funds.

Office Management Training 
(FSI/SPAS/OMT)
The Office Management Training division provides secretarial and office management training for  Foreign Service, Civil Service, and Foreign Service Nationals personnel, emphasizing office management, professional, teambuilding, technical, and communication skills.

Foreign Service National Training (FSN) 
Six Divisions in SPAS provide training for Foreign Service Nationals: Administrative Management, Consular, Economic, Political, Public Diplomacy and Office Management. Courses specifically for FSNs are held overseas and at FSI. In addition, FSNs can attend any unclassified functional courses offered by various divisions on a space-available basis.

Area Studies (FSI/SPAS/AS)
The Area Studies division provides knowledge about a region or country and related American interests and policies. The courses cover history, politics, economics, religion, society and culture, with an emphasis on relevant global issues and United States interests and challenges. More than 40 formal courses are offered. Individual guidance may be provided to those not able to participate in the courses.

Curriculum and Staff Development (FSI/SPAS/CSD)
The Curriculum and Staff Development division provides services that enhance the performance and skills of FSI instructors and Department of State personnel. CSD courses cover topics such as presentation and delivery skills, facilitation, program design and evaluation, performance measurement, adult learning, and training of trainers.  In addition, CSD staff members are available to assist offices and bureaus throughout the Department with training delivery, program evaluation, staff development, offsite facilitation, FSN training, teambuilding, and other areas of organizational effectiveness.

II. BACKGROUND

In the past, FSI/SPAS has contracted with a variety of companies to provide insurance coverage for a wide range of needs across its nine divisions.  This led to multiple contracts addressing similar needs.  Some of these contracts were solicited each and every year; others were awarded on a multiyear basis.  Some were awarded to a single company while some had multiple awardees.  When a new activity or an existing activity required insurance coverage, FSI had to send out a new solicitation.  The struggle to anticipate all needs related to insurance coverage, the constant need to solicit, and the rigidity of the single contract led to identification of a more flexible contracting tool.

With a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA), FSI/SPAS is actively seeking contractors to provide a variety of insurance needs. 

III. REQUIREMENTS

Insurance provided for domestic activities must include some or all of the following benefits:
•	$100,000 Accident and Sickness Expense Benefits:  Covered medical expenses incurred within the USA to include: medical or surgical treatment, services and supplies, hospital services, local ambulance, visits to a physician’s office, medical evacuation and repatriation of remains.  Covered expenses are subject to a $50 -$100 deductible.
•	$25,000 Accidental Death & Dismemberment Benefit

Insurance provided for overseas activities must include the following benefits:
•	GLOBAL COVERAGE: $100,000 Accident and Sickness Expense Benefits:  Covered medical expenses incurred while traveling overseas to include: medical evacuation if necessary, emergency and hospitalization services, medical or surgical treatment, visits to doctors offices, prescriptions, ambulance and lab services, emergency dental coverage, and repatriation of remains.  Covered expenses are subject to a $100 deductible.

Additional items to be provided must include:
•	The issuance of an insurance card to each individual
•	Coverage of all individuals aged 21 through 85
•	Flexibility regarding coverage: At very short notice people may need to be added/dropped from the list of covered individuals under the insurance policy

<SUBJECT>Q -- Public Health Surveillance of Chemical and Toxin Exposures
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces its intention to negotiate a sole source contract with the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC), 3201 New Mexico Avenue, Suite 330, Washington, DC 20016.  AAPCC is the association of the 63 poison control centers in the United States and as such receives data concerning 2.2 million poison exposures annually from U.S. poison control centers.  This poisoning data is updated every 4-10 minutes, 24 hours a day.  Toxicologists, epidemiologists, and statisticians at AAPCC and CDC (NCEH/EHHE/HSB) have developed and continually modify categories of information collected by the national poisonings data system to analyze for aberration detection.

The Contractor, as an independent agent and not as an agent of the government, shall provide CDC with data about poisonings from the Poison Control Centers (PCCs) (i.e., call volume, clinical effect data, and specific substance data) for use in CDC toxicosurveillance and notification of public health officials of aberrations.  The Contractor shall provide real-time toxicosurveillance data in a manner that meets or exceeds CDC security requirements established by the Public Health Information Network (PHIN).  The software and hardware used to collect national poisonings data will be flexible enough to eventually allow for the uploading of, or ensure the accuracy of coding for, text fields from the PCC record; is compatible with the four data entry platforms currently being used by the PCCs; and can be modified as CDC’s data needs grow and change.  The system and the data collected will be continually reviewed and evaluated collaboratively by the Contractor and CDC toxicology and surveillance experts so that data quality and utility is improved.  All work performed under this contract is done so under guidelines and limitations set forth in the executed licensing agreement(s).  So that progress can be monitored, the Contractor shall provide quarterly reports to CDC.  Reports will describe the progress of each activity, as well as the costs associated with that progress.

Technical Requirements – 
The Contractor shall:
1. Complete initial rebuild of national poisoning data system, ensuring CDC access to data, compliance with CDC security and technology specifications, and system redundancies to protect the data.  
2. Continue to review 10-20 aberrations detected in the regularly monitored exposure data and provide subject matter expertise interpretation and resolution of the aberration as appropriate.  This activity is the daily operation and purpose of the national poisoning data system for CDC.
3. Expand the current capability of national poisoning data so it can be utilized by GIS software applications and will purchase the software to allow creation of visual display of national poisoning data.
4. Develop a database and track the details about alerts issued by the national poisoning data system, including origin, follow-up actions, contacts, and resolution.  
5. Facilitate an evaluation activity local poison control centers to expand their surveillance capabilities and improve their ability to detect aberrations at the local level.  The proposed activity will replicate and expand the national aberrancy detection algorithms at 3 local PCCs; the evaluation will compare detection of anomalies at the local level versus the national level.
6. Facilitate an evaluation activity local poison control centers to: a) develop a database to track the details (e.g., origin, follow-up actions, contacts, resolution) about aberrations that their local detection systems identify; and b) compare their anomalies with PCC surveillance to determine whether there is any added public health benefit in conducting surveillance on the local level in addition to national surveillance.   The PCC tracking databases will be compared for sensitivity and specificity to the databases developed by AAPCC for national aberration detection.  
7. Facilitate evaluation activity at local poison control centers to evaluate the quality of the data that is uploaded to the national poisoning data system by comparing the coded variables (available at a national level) to the more comprehensive text data that is entered and stored at the local level.  PCCs will pull records of past calls and use fellow and/or local staff to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the codes entered into the national data system to capture information recorded in the text fields.
8. Facilitate an evaluation activity local poison control centers to test the ability of the system to detect a staged chemical event.  PCCs to conduct a “mock event” whereby poisoning data is planted in those PCC’s data and sent to AAPCC’s national poisoning data system.  The evaluation will determine the sensitivity of the national poisoning data system to detect the “event”.
9. Facilitate a survey of PCC and other public health officials about their understanding of the role and function of clinical toxicology in the public health setting.  
10. Provide one staff person at each poison control center access to training and/or training materials about the new national poisoning data system.

Reporting Schedule – At 4, 8 and 12 months after contract award, the Contractor shall provide progress report describing expenditures to date, number and nature of aberrations, number of outbreaks or real events detected, resolution of aberrations, and upgrades to the hardware and software.

The Statutory Authorities permitting other than Full and Open Competition is FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.     Interested parties may submit a statement of qualifications and experience which, if timely received, will be evaluated by CDC to determine if a competitive solicitation should be issued.     Inquires must be received by July 14, 2006, at 4:00PM, Eastern Standard Time (EST).  Collect calls will not be accepted.  Responses may be E-mailed to Charlene Allison at fkk1@cdc.gov.  Questions regarding this proposed acquisition may be directed to Charlene Allison, Contract Officer, 770-488-2841.

IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 		INA - Immigration and Nationality Act 		INS - Immigration and Naturalization Service  		SSA - Social Security Administration 		INS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program 		ESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor) (a) Authority.  Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.  	(b) Who is Covered.  INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination.  These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.  	(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements.   Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S.  The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9).  Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer.  Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site: http://www.ins.gov/graphics/services/employerinfo/index.htm . 	(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs.  The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees.  Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program.  If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9. (1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235. (2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia.  The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem.  To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981.  Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. (3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature.  If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature.  To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.  	(e) Employee Rights.  The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.  	(f) Compliance Assistance.  More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.  	(g) Penalties/Sanctions.  Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions.  As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms.  They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment.  A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by the closing date of this announcement will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Offers are due by close of business 21 June 2006.

SELECTION CRITERIA: The following shall be considered in selecting a horse for service: Most riders have little or no experience. The horse must be capable of carrying 200-250 lbs. of weight for long periods of time (6-8 hours/Day). Horses will be subjected to high desert/low desert; mountainous terrain; loose rocks; thick brush; extremely hot temperatures in the summer and drastically cool winters. A certified Border Patrol Instructor and the Coordinator or a designee for the Tucson Sector will administer a series of tests to determine whether the horse has the capability of working in the Border Patrol environment. Each horse will be required to pass these tests for acceptance into the program. SELECTION EXERCISES/TESTS: A candidate horse must be sound and well proportioned in conformation. The horse shall be gentle and calm with a good disposition. Following are a series of tests that the agents will conduct to determine whether or not a horse will meet the minimum requirements for purchase. Approach- When approached, the horse should turn and face, standing quietly, especially in a confined area. Halter- The horse should be easily haltered without giving any indications of head-shyness or resistance to “catching”. Leading- The candidate horse should exhibit good ground manners and should remain calm when being handled. Saddling- The candidate horse should stand still and calm while being saddled. He should show no signs of aggressiveness of being “cinchy” during this process. Mounting- The candidate horse should stand still and calm during this evolution.

Excessive force should not be necessary during this process. Dismounting- The candidate horse should stand quietly while the rider dismounts. Loading/Unloading- The candidate horse should load and unload from a variety of trailers without difficulty. Balking will be a disqualifying factor when considering the purchase of a candidate horse. Shoeing- The candidate horse should stand quietly and calmly while being shod or having his feet worked on. TEMPERAMENT: All candidate horses should exhibit the “proper temperament” during the entire selection process. The candidate horse should be calm when any number of people or equipment are moving or standing around him. He must display confidence in any number of environments, including areas of unsure footing, tight enclosed or narrow spaces, moving vehicles/equipment, loud noises and/or bangs and popping sounds.

The candidate horse must possess a gentle and calm demeanor during the hours of darkness and around large groups of people. DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED: Current vaccination/Quarantine records. Health certificate issued by a certified/licensed veterinarian. Registration certificates, breed surveys and other related paperwork, as applicable. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: A certified veterinarian will perform a full physical examination of the candidate horse as a prerequisite to completing the selection process. MISCELLANEOUS: The Government retains the right to return a candidate horse to the contractor/seller, if after 45 days, the animal is deemed not suitable for service. This determination will be based on the selection criteria or the horse is discovered to have a pre-existing medical problem, chronic disease or a hereditary defect that could render the horse unsuitable for service. The vendor will replace the horse within thirty days of receipt of notice that any of the aforementioned conditions exist. This animal shall be replaced with a suitable horse that meets all the selection criteria. The Government retains the sole right to make any and all determinations as to the acceptability/unacceptability of the candidate. The contractor/seller shall not, in any case, hold the Government responsible for the disposition of a medically or physically defective horse.

<DESC>This is a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Notice for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ATF has a requirement for a Blanket Purchase Agreements BPA covering a five year period that will be available for publication of legal advertisements for the purpose of announcing property seizures. ATF is mandated by law to publish all property that is seized for forfeiture. This has been further defined as Notice of the seizure of property and the intent to forfeit must be published once a week for three successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the judicial district in which the proceeding is brought. Other printed media such as periodicals, magazines and books are not acceptable. The purpose of these advertisements is to give notice to all parties who may have a vested interest in the seized property who have not already been noticed. ATF currently has an extended need to publish all property seized for forfeiture in the Texas Southern Federal Judicial District.  The Contractor shall publish the legal advertisements in a newspaper of general circulation.  That is, a newspaper that publishes news of general interest and character to the public, to include political and business events, circulating among the general public in Texas, Southern Judicial District and specifically Harris County, Texas.  The advertisement shall include at a minimum specific descriptive information regarding the property and its seizure by ATF.  In addition the advertisement will include instructions as to how parties with an interest in the property seized can file a claim to contest the seizure and intended forfeiture of the property. In Texas, more than one Federal judicial district is located within the state.  Counties comprised in the Southern Federal Judicial district are given in United States Code 28 U.S.C. 124 b.  Harris, County, Texas within the Southern Federal Judicial District is the area that needs to be covered in this advertising requirement. To demonstrate publishing of substantial quantities offerors must show that they have at least a paid circulation of 2,500 or more copies or have at least one newspaper in circulation by subscription per 4,000 people in that judicial district and specifically in Harris County, Texas.  The Contractor shall publish the advertisements in a newspaper, which has a circulation of substantial quantities in the judicial district and county set forth above.  The Contractor shall furnish evidence that it publishes a newspaper of general circulation in the judicial district and county.  Substantial quantities excludes distribution of unsolicited copies. Based upon historical use and expected future requirements, ATF estimates the volume of seized property advertisements in Harris County, Texas to be between 4,000 and 15,000 lines per 12-month period over the next 60 months. The Contractor shall accept from the ATF, Asset Forfeiture and Seized Property Branch, 5 working days prior to publication, the text for ad publication i.e. Monday submission for next Monday publication. Typically, ATF will transmit data to the Contractor via electronic transmission.  The preferred method is via Internet e-mail as a word processing attachment.  The ATF may transmit the data manually via fax or by disk to the Contractor. Each advertisement shall be placed in sufficient time in order to be published on a specified date.  The advertisements shall be published at 1 week intervals.  The newspaper shall use the smallest font available. The Contractor shall provide the Asset Forfeiture Office at ATF draft copies of each new weekly advertisement.  The Asset Forfeiture Office will examine the data for accuracy and layout before publication of the advertisement. Asset Forfeiture will inspect services and accept or reject the ad within 3 days of receipt.  The draft must specify the font size and the cost of the advertisement. After publication the Contractor shall also provide copies of the actual ad so Asset Forfeiture may verify the ad was published.  Unless the Government makes an error, the Contractor will correct and re-publicize, at no additional cost to the Government, any errors. The following Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR clauses and provisions are incorporated and are to remain in full force and effect: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items Jan 05, 52.212-2, Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Sep 05.

                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002. 
    (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

An offeror's proposal may not be considered when the proposed price is unreasonably high or unrealistically low.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than price.  Since the technical criteria are considered to be of greatest importance, the Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the offeror offering the lowest price.

These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) No. 06-14-AEDCPKP:  The Department of Defense's Test Resource Management Center (DTRMC), through Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) is soliciting research proposals in the area of hypersonics testing and evaluation/science and technology (T&E/S&T) development.   DTRMC seeks innovative proposals that will allow improved test and evaluation of current and future hypersonics systems over the next 10 to 15 years.  The goal is not to develop hypersonic flight systems or subsystems in this solicitation, but to investigate improved ground and flight test facilities, techniques and test methodologies that are needed to support hypersonic system/subsystem development.  This program does not support basic research, but rather the application and extension of technology to produce and understand a real or simulated flight environment.  The range of interest covers all hypersonic flight, both sustained flight in the atmosphere and the test environment of reentry vehicles.  TRMC seeks advances in hypersonic and related technologies in the areas (not in priority): 1) INSTRUMENTATION FOR HYPERSONIC FLIGHT TESTING OF HOT STRUCTURES.  This includes sensor and sensor integration techniques for in-flight measurement of surface and material temperatures, surface pressures, surface heat flux, structural strain and deformation, and surface ablation/recession, in and on carbon/carbon and carbon/silicon-carbide materials.  Measurement techniques must perform at temperature for up to two hours.  Techniques must not compromise the structural or thermal performance of the parent material.  2) SIMULATION OF MATERIAL ABLATION/EROSION AT HIGH VELOCITIES.  Vehicles which reenter the atmosphere or are exposed to high velocity sustained flight will likely encounter an environment which causes loss of surface material that can change the vehicle shape in an unpredictable manner.  Flight testing is very expensive and ground test facilities cannot provide the required flight simulation parameters, duration of test and model size to adequately investigate the phenomena.  This effort seeks to extend simulation techniques in ground test facilities wherein the test article material is selected to behave like carbon/carbon and carbon/silicon-carbide materials, but loses material in a reduced environment which can be provided in existing ground test facilities.  3) TECHNIQUES TO ACHIEVE A VARIABLE MACH FREE-JET TEST CAPABILITY.  There is a requirement for ground testing a complete hypersonic propulsion system wherein the Mach number is varied during a continuous facility run.  While facility temperatures and pressures can be properly varied, the facility nozzle which produces Mach number is deficient.  AEDC plans to build a variable Mach flexible wall nozzle to reach Mach 5 true-temperature test conditions.  It is believed that this maximizes technology for a two-dimensional free-jet nozzle.  The objective of this solicitation is to extend the variable Mach test capability to Mach 8.  This technology is anticipated for the Aerodynamic Propulsion Test Unit (APTU) facility at AEDC, however concepts that can be applied to other hypersonic test facilities will be considered.  4) COMPUTATIONAL MODELING OF HYPERSONIC NOZZLE FLOWS.  In most hypersonic ground test facilities the test gas is energized in a plenum, expanded in a nozzle and then presented to a test article in a test chamber.  It is recognized that energy modes and gas species vary from an isentropic flow process in the rapidly expanding flow.  While the test gas is unlikely to duplicate the flight condition, knowledge of its composition will assist in interpretation of test data.  This effort seeks measurement and modeling of facility flow parameters with the intent of applying the results to a variety of hypersonic facility flows.  5) EXPERIMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR HYPERSONIC SEPARATION DYNAMICS.  It is expected that next-generation hypersonic weapon systems will employ some type of armament/munitions separation during an aerodynamic maneuver from a carrier vehicle in hypersonic atmosphere flight.  A vast store of subsonic aircraft armament/munitions separation information is available.  Some hypersonic work was accomplished for the space shuttle separation issues several decades ago.  The objective of this solicitation is to investigate and identify flight phenomena incurred during body separation with the goal of simulating the environment with aerodynamic models in a hypersonic wind tunnel with a Captive Trajectory System (CTS).  Research in this topic should use the current state-of-the-art as a starting point and define those things that need to be improved or developed (e.g. dynamic force balance sensitivity to rapidly changing loads as the two-body shock-induced flow fields interact).

PROJECT SCOPE:  Awards totaling approximately $2.5 - $3.0M are expected to be made in FY07.  Increased funding levels are anticipated to occur in the following fiscal years.  Prospective proposers should be aware that there is no certainty in the funding or level of effort.  

GENERAL INFORMATION:  Proposals should address development and/or operational test and evaluation technologies.  DTRMC strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities.  Teaming among academia, industry, and/or government partners is encouraged; however, this is no a requirement.  Projects with strong transition plans to DoD T&E ground or flight test facilities or with DoD T&E facility participation will receive preference.  Because awards may be made in which contractors expect to access or generate unclassified information that may be sensitive and inappropriate for release to the public, the contracts will contain DFARS Clause 252.204-7000, Disclosure of Information.  This requirement will be in subcontracts as well.  Projects will be awarded in phases with the later phases being funded in FY08 or later and will be contingent on funds availability, merit of performance and previous phases, and anticipated future T&E requirements for the technologies being addressed.  In order to minimize the magnitude of the proposal preparation and review process, a proposal abstract of no more than 15 pages total should be submitted by 17 Jul 2006.  Each proposal should specify the benefits to U.S. military service and the executing organization with subcontractors (where applicable), and their specific roles.  The proposal should briefly describe the out-year effort beyond completion of the Phase I effort.  Each proposal should address a specific T&E hypersonic need.

Each proposer and subcontractor will be required to submit written verification stating they are aware of their responsibility to have DoD approval for public release of information pertaining to the proposed project (including technical reports, papers, and presentations) as required by DoD regulations regarding t he dissemination of militarily critical technologies and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).

EVALUATION:  Evaluation of proposal abstracts and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria:  (1)  overall scientific and technical merit, (2)  relevance to current T&E hypersonic technology test requirements not addressed in other DoD programs, (3) offeror’s capabilities and related experience, (4) cost realism of proposed effort and (5) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition to T&E application and/or to DoD T&E facilities.  Upon review, the Hypersonic Test Working Group, through AEDC, will respond to proposal abstracts with a recommendation to submit or not to submit a full proposal and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposals and proposal abstracts should be submitted on CD-ROM in .PDF format and forwarded to:  AEDC/PKP, Attn:  Sue Tate, 100 Kindel Drive Suite A332, Arnold AFB TN  37389-1332.

on Sunday 8/20?  Will the departure date be Saturday the 26th or Sunday
8/27th?  If so, will the arrival/departure pattern be the same way for all

Question:

Sleeping Rooms:  Is it my understanding that the sleeping room requirement
is a minimum of 25 to 40 rooms with triple occupancy plus 33 rooms to 60
rooms double occupancy?  For a total of 58 rooms minimum to 100 rooms maximum
each night?  

Response:

No.  It is an either or situation.

Question:

For the triple occupancy rooms, Do you need 2 beds and a rollaway?  Or will a
room with 2 double beds be sufficient?  Am I correct in assuming that you
are requesting a room with 2 beds for the double occupancy rooms or are
these couples that can sleep in  a room with a King size bed?

Response:

These are individuals -- no couples.  The beds can be twin or double but each person must have their own bed.  If there are 3 to a room, we would prefer a sofa bed.  No rollaways.



Question:

Meeting Space:  Day 1-you have indicated (2) general session rooms but have
requested Projector screens for 3 rooms on day one.  Please verify how many
screens you need in the (2) meeting rooms requested and what size screens
you require. 

Response:

It is two projector screens only; one for the general session room and one for the breakout room.  

Question:

Please specify what type of meals you would like for each meeting, plated or
buffet etc. 

Response:

 All plated with one buffet lunch.

Do you want a working lunch on day 1 for 15P in the meeting room set up u-shape? 

Response:

Yes. The lunch will be after the meeting.  It can be a buffet served either in the same room or another room.  

Question:

Do you want a working dinner on day one for the 80P in the same room or will you need a separate room?  

Response:

No it is not a working dinner.  We prefer separate rooms for all of the meals.  

Question:

Do you want plated or buffet?  

Response:

Plated
Question:

Day 2-4-  Do you want the meals in separate meeting room? 

Response:

Yes.   

Question:

What type of Lunch & dinner-plated or buffet?  

Response:

All plated with the exception of Thursday lunch which should be buffet.

Question:

What type of data projector are you requesting?  LCD? Lumins?  This makes a
difference in the price quote? 

Response:

Not sure what an LCD is.  We use an in-focus type.


CLARITY ON THE FOLLOWING:

Sleeping Rooms:

Minimum of 25 rooms to a maximum of 40 rooms in triple occupancy OR Minimum of 33 rooms to a maximum of 50 rooms in double occupancy.
