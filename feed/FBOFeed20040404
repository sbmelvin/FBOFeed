<DESC>This amendment to the solicitation provides answers to Contractor's questions, revises the PWS, reduces the number of estimated hours to 164 hours, changes the performance period to 15 April through 30 September 2004, and sets the new closing date to 12 April 2004 at 9:00 a.m.  Question 1.  Can FAA Part 91 operators be awarded this contract.  If yes, what is the priority/criteria to schedule missions with 91 vs. 135 operators?  Answer - No, the contractors must meet the DODI 4500.53 requirements.  Question 2.  Insurance Requirements:  a.  Paragraph 1.6.1 defines a Combat Equipped Jumper as "an aircraft passenger."  Question 2a:  Does the government require passenger insurance for all operators under this contract?  Answer 2a.  If they exceed the 25 mile limit from point of takeoff they will require seating and insurance IAW DODD.  However, the PWS has changed and the Goverment will not require the contractor to fly a mission which will exceed 25 miles.   
b.   If no passenger insurance requirements, is the Government
aware that the FAA requires 135 operators to have passenger insurance but not 91 operators?  Answer 2b - Yes
c.  Because most of this work is done on Military installations,
are there any other insurance requirements (i.e. 52.228-5) specified by this contract.  Answer 2c.  The minimum amounts of insurance required in accordance with 52.228-5 “Insurance-Work on a Government Installation” are as follows:  Type:  Automobile Bodily Injury Liability, Amount:  $200,000 per person/$500,000 per occurrence; Type: Property Damage Liability, Amount: $20,000 per occurrence; Type: Workers Compensation & Occupational Disease, Amount: As required by Federal and State Statutes; Type:  Employer’s Liability, Amount: $100,000.
3.  Paragraph 1.1, Scope of Work provides references by which to
operate.  a.  Please provide a copy or a way to get a copy of "Under Secretary of Defense Memorandum, Requirements for Airdrop Operations, 31 Jan 03"  Answer 3a.  As I can not attach the file, please email me a separate request and forward it via email.    b.  AR 95-1 is a broad guide for operation of Army aircraft.  What portion of AR 95-1 pertains to this contract? Answer 3b: None known.  4.  Question:  Paragraph 1.5.2, Required Briefings, states "For Air Support  Services involving passenger operations, a briefing shall be conducted in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulation 135.117."   Because Para 1.6.1 basically defines all personnel as passengers, is this 135.117 briefing required for all missions?  Answer 4.  It is the most complete, but if doing parachute operations items must be added for the type of mission.  5.  ....have a Lockheed C-130 that we would like to use on this contract. We will have to operate the aircraft as a Public Aircraft under a single Government Contract and the aircraft would only fly for this contract, basing out of  Fayetteville, NC. This C-130 is configured the same as the current C-130s operated by the military and could provide a smooth transition from training to actual conditions. My question is would this aircraft be acceptable to use on this contract.  Answer 5.  The Government must inspect and approve public aircraft.  All responses will be considered.      
6.  Para 1.2 has a link to the regs needed for the performance of this contract.  The link https://asociweb.soc.mil/hqs-asoc/dcssoa/standards.htm does not work.  Is there another workable link? http://asociweb.soc.mil/hqs-asoc/dcssoa/standard.htm  - the site without the s at the end of http.  If unable, go to the ASOC website, select DCSSOA from the applets on the left side, then select standards and you will be on the correct site.  7.  Para 1.5.3.2  and 1.5.3.3 requires "approved side foldup seats."  Question 7.  What is an approved seat?  Answer 7.  It is a seat that has been approved for passenger transport from point A to B by the administrator FAA.  Question 8.   Does this grant the waiver requirement if the mission is outside 25 miles as stated in para 1.7 c?  Answer 8.  No waiver to the new policy letter is yet approved or working/staffed as of yet, the 25 mile limit still applies No waiver to the new policy letter is yet approved or working/staffed as of yet, the 25 mile limit still applies.  However, the Performance Work Statement is revised to state: The Government will not require the contractor to fly any missions which exceed 25 miles.  Question 9.  Para 1.7 a imposes a 25 mile rule.  Is this a hard rule, max of 25 miles or will this be adjusted to accommodate certain missions?  Answer 9.  25 mile rule is in effect, no adjustments authorized until a deviation is approved by AMC and/or FAA. However, the PWS has been changed, no flights will exceed 25 miles.  Question 10.  Is this solicitation for all units under USASOC?  Answer 10 - No, this solicitation is only to support USAJFKSWCS.  Question 11 - Can the solicitation be amended to allow all missions to be performed under Part 91 regulations as public use aircraft rather than under Part 135 commercial regulations? Answer 11 - No, compliance with the DoD regulation is required.  The revised PWS follows:  1.  GENERAL. 
1.1.  SCOPE OF WORK.  The contractor shall provide all direct labor, material, transportation, supervision, fixed wing aircraft, administration requirements for conducting air operations and all other items and services (not specifically identified herein to be Government-furnished), necessary to perform Air Support Services for Government directed parachute operations in accordance with DOD Directive 4500.53, Under Secretary of Defense Memorandum, Requirements for Airdrop Operations, 31 Jan 03, Army Regulation (AR) 95-1, USSOCOM Directive 350-8, Fort Bragg Aviation Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), Code of Federal Avaition Regulations (CFAR) Part 91, 105, and 119 as applicable, USASOC Supplement to AR 95-1, (CFAR) Part 135/AMC/SOA and USASOC Policy, as applies, for U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (USAJFKSWCS), at Shannon Airfield, Fort AP Hill, VA, Fort Bragg, North Carolina and other sites in the Southeastern U.S. as designated by the Government.  The contractor shall perform to the standards specified throughout this PWS and the standard generally acceptable to the commercial Aviation Industry performing related or similar requirements.  
1.2.  SPECIFICATIONS.  Air Support Services support shall be provided as an augmentation to Air Support Operations (ASO) conducted by U.S. Government-owned [military] Government operated aviation assets.  The schedule of Air Support Services shall be provided to the contractor by an authorized Government representative as is required to satisfy USAJFKSWCS mission needs and in accordance with USASOC Policy.  This requirement shall necessitate a commiserate degree of flexibility on the part of the contractor with regard to aircraft operations and workload scheduling, mission/flight preparations and the actual execution of the performance and performance quality of the services iterated throughout this PWS.  Contract performance and performance quality shall strictly adhere to the Directives, Regulations and Guidance iterated in paragraph 1.1. and elsewhere throughout this PWS.  This data is accessible at the following website https://asociweb.soc.mil/hqs-asoc/dcssoa/standards.htm and links thereon.  The unique mission/flight parameters (as governed by Government-provided Programs of Instruction (POI) related to the parachute operations to be conducted) and strict aviation safety requirements required for contract performance shall necessitate to the contractor to provide fixed wing aircraft with side door or ramp capability.  
1.2.1.  MISSION/FLIGHT ITERATION CANCELLATION.  The Government shall make every attempt to provide the contractor with seven (7) working days notice of a scheduled mission/flight iteration to be performed under the contract.  However, the Government reserves the right to make notice of a scheduled mission/flight iteration with less notice.  In the event the Government schedules a mission/flight iteration and subsequently cancels the same, for example, in the advent of unforeseeable inclement weather condition changes, cancellation shall be effected by the contractor at no additional cost to the Government.  One exception to the aforementioned policy shall be enforced.  Government notification of a cancelled a mission/flight iteration relayed to the contractor after the contractor’s aircraft have taken-off from the contractor’s principle base of aviation operations shall incur a late cancellation fee.
