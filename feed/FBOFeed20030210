<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about February 26, 2003 with an anticipated closing date of March 28, 2003. The NASA Langley Research Center aircraft are used by the Government to conduct research programs and support the Center as required. The aircraft, with one exception, are operated as Public Use aircraft and are not subject to all the requirements of Civil Aircraft. The B-200 is a certificated aircraft. NASA has established its own airworthiness certification program under Public Law 85-568, "National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958. Flight requirements, quality systems, and environ-mental constraints are designed into the inspections/maintenance programs to assure that safety and the airworthiness integrity of the aircraft are maintained. NASA requirements, at a minimum, are equal to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) standards. The authority "to make, promulgate, issue, rescind, and amend rules and regulations governing the manner of its operations and the exercise of the power vested in it by law," are used when developing airworthiness programs for the unique research and support aircraft operated by NASA Langley.   Standard FAA rules/regulations will be followed for civil operated aircraft. The Contractor when in the Government's best interest is to provide services and support for the aircraft in the following areas: 1.Provide Aircraft Inspection, Maintenance and Repair (the Boeing 757 is a primary aircraft) at Contractor's Facility with inspection packages provided by the Government, and provide a list of any defects/discrepancies found and repairs/testing/replacement of parts considered necessary and a price quote for each. After review of this list, the Government will authorize only those action items determined necessary by the Government; 2.Provide maintenance and repair service wherever Langley Research Center operates its aircraft, and furnish all necessary materials, specialized support equipment and manpower, to perform the requested maintenance services and/or repairs; 3.Provide services such as engine repairs to Rolls Royce RB211 engines, strip and painting of the Beech King Air 200, Aircraft Service Bulletin compliance, FAA Airworthiness Directive compliance and additional inspection requirements as directed. Provide specialized tools, test equipment and/or aircraft engines and/or engine components, for use by the Government for limited periods of time by rent or lease. (An example of this requirement would be a rental RB211 engine, installation tools, and test equipment.); 4.Provide approved replacement parts and materials as required with 24-hour on call parts support for AOG (Aircraft On Ground); 5. The Contractor is required to have a current FAA certificate for performing the work and utilize a Quality Control System that conforms to the current FAA, Parts 121 or 145. All maintenance performed is to be in accordance with aircraft manufacturer's maintenance/overhaul manuals or procedures and/or NASA approved procedures. All parts or components that are repaired, replaced, or provided are to meet applicable FAA or NASA standards of serviceability; 6. Provide documentation in the form of NASA inspection cards and any other documentation required by FAA procedures.  When work is required at the Contractor's facility, delivery of the aircraft to or from the Contractor's designated facility will be accomplished by NASA personnel or a NASA designated crew. A Government representative shall be present when aircraft inspection, maintenance, or repair is being performed for the purpose of making decisions appropriate to this particular aircraft. When necessary, flight-testing will be accomplished by a NASA provided aircrew. This procurement will be issued as a Time and Materials requirement for a five (5) year period.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 488190 and $6.0M, respectively.  The DPAS Rating for this procurement is DO-C9.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for renewal of annual maintenance for Unipass software.  This software is used for analysis of uncertainties in several NASA programs such as MORPHING, Ultra-lightweight Inflatable Structures, Crashworthiness, and a new program initiative on risk based design methodologies.	This purchase will include a one year with (2) one additional option year of performance. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Prediction Probe, Inc., who is the only responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy Agency requirements.  This procurement is for continuation of currect software maintenance.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to generate the supplies and services and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 18, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The goal of the Georgia Enterprise Growth Initiative (GEGI) is to create a free market business environment, further develop the financial sector infrastructure and to facilitate the rate of enterprise growth in Georgia.  

The activity outlined is planned to be implemented over five years, with an IQC buy-in mechanism to address the needs of Georgian enterprises to grow. USAID estimates the total cost of GEGI not to exceed $45 million, including up to $25 million for the main activity and up to $20 million for the IQC buy-in mechanism. The activity will have a two-year base period and three one-year options for extension.  The activity is so structured so as to allow the Mission to revalidate the applicability of the design in light of a new strategy to be completed in 2003, and to make annual determinations as to whether the activity remains a funding priority after the expiration of the base period. The three components of this activity will address the enabling environment for enterprise growth through improved policy reform, increased access to finance and increased market-oriented production.  These three components reflect the three Intermediate Results of USAID/Caucasus Strategic Objective 1.3 Accelerated Development and Growth of Private Enterprises.  A key thrust of this activity is to support the development and growth of private sector mechanisms and institutions to achieve enterprise growth.

USAID/Caucasus encourages the contractor to take an innovative approach to the implementation of program activities, bringing to bear international best practices and new ways of doing development business.  Also, consistent with USAID/Washingtons recently announced Global Development Alliance (GDA), the contractor should seek appropriate opportunities to use GEGI as a catalyst to mobilize the resources of private corporations, foundations, universities, and other non-government organizations interested in working in Georgia. For more information on the GDA, see    http://www.usaid.gov/press/releases/2001/fs010515.html. This could be accomplished through strategic alliances, and leveraging additional resources consistent within USAID policies and regulations.

GEGI will be managed and implemented in a politically unstable region.  Georgia is important to U.S. foreign policy interests and objectives in Eurasia.  Accordingly, the contractor must be cognizant of the imperative for GEGI to be a highly successful and responsive economic growth program. 

As a five-year program, GEGI will include the following three components: 1) Demand Driven Policy Reform; 2) Increased Access to Finance through Institutional Strengthening; 3) Georgia Competitiveness Initiative.

The contractor shall provide technical assistance, training, management information systems, grant management, public awareness and donor coordination services, in such a professional, timely and culturally appropriate manner as to achieve the agreed upon results defined below.  The agreed results shall be achieved in the areas of: 1) Improved implementation of policy reforms through a strengthened demand side private sector capacity to drive economic policy coupled with improved Government of Georgia implementation of policy reforms by strengthening the GOGs market-orientation (approximately 70% of Activity Budget); 2) Increased access to finance through institutional strengthening (approximately 10% of Activity Budget); and 3) Increased market-oriented production through improved competitiveness, international best practices, and quality standards (approximately 20% of Activity Budget).

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for ABAQUS STANDARD SOFTWARE LEASE RENEWAL. NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for an ABAQUS standard software lease renewal.	This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).	NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the software lease renewal from ABAQUS South Inc., 3700 Forums Drive, Suite 101, Flower Mound, TX 75028, under the authority of FAR 13.106.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons:  (1)ABAQUS has proprietary copyright of the ABAQUS software.  Review of current technical literature substantiates that only ABAQUS can provide the software and associated technical support.   (2)No other software has the extensive capabilities ABAQUS has for performing highly nonlinear finite element analyses necessary to support the structural analysis of flight hardware. (3)ABAQUS has been in use at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) for eleven years.  A significant number of training hours have been invested in learning and using ABAQUS software.  This knowledge base and efficiency can not easily be transferred to another offerors software package.  This knowledge base and efficiency can not easily be transferred to another offerors software package.  There now exists at MSFC a significant number of analytical models created in ABAQUS.  A significant amount of time and resources would be required to recreate these models for use with any other software. (4)Renewal of the ABAQUS software lease is critical in order to minimize the schedule impact to programs at MSFC, which rely on ABAQUS as a structural analysis tool.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. (local time) on February 25, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualification will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note B.

<DESC>NA Synopsis PM TRCS/EPLRS PROGRAM This is a Synopsis for the acquisition of the Near Term Digital Radio (NTDR) Receiver Transmitter (RT) and INFOSEC upgrade kits to support US Army fielding requirements.  The current requirement is for a quantity of 248 RTs and 314 INFOSEC upgrade kits wit h a 100% option for the NTDR RT quantitiy of 248.   ITT in Fort Wayne, Indiana and Clifton, NJ, is the sole producer of the equipment.  Subcontracting opportunities through the prime manufacturer, ITT will be available upon award of this contract.  All inq uiries for subcontracting efforts shall be made to the prime contractor, ITT. Description:  The NTDR is a high throughput, Army communication system for the inter Tactical Operational Center (TOC) traffic and the backbone communication system for the division and brigade areas.  The NTDR will also participate in the Tactical Interne t.  It is one of the major elements, which will provide seamless digital communications capability throughout the fighting force for the Digital Battlefield of the 21st Century.  The NTDR must interface with routing devices such as the INC and TMG.  It mus t also be installed on mobile platforms and interoperate with the external command control systems. The NTDR system will consist of a radio with ancillary support items including an antenna, an installation kit, and a network management terminal if required. NTDR is an information transport system which will be the data transport communications system se rving principally data terminals resident at Brigade and Below, but will also have application at higher echelon units operating within the Brigade area. NTDR will be a Secret High system. The NTDR system will provide communications service to Battlefield Functional Area (BFA) systems that have short speed of service requirements and will provide backbone service between SINCGARS and the MSE Packet Network. TMGs could be used to interconnect autonomous NTDR Brigade networks to create Division-wide coverage.  To meet speed of service requirements for critical traffic that transcends Brigade boundaries, special dedicated subnets and/or speedier alternatives to TMGs will be considered.  An NTDR may connect to a host, TMG, or INC.  Every connection point is both a source and a destination for traffic. The amount of traffic being sent and received by an individual connection point will vary based on the dynamics of combat; e.g., position reporting, combat losses of equipment and command personnel; reassignment of r esponsibilities among personnel and mission force elements due to on-the-move replanning.  In compliance with the principles set down by the Army Science Board the NTDR shall comply with the Department of the Army C4I Technical Architecture (C4I TA). The N TDR shall be capable of supporting a brigade community of computers and networks that communicate using the Internet Protocol Suite (IPS). The NTDR shall support non-IP compliant hosts.  The NTDR shall have an operational requirement of 300 connection poin ts as a minimum  in a Brigade area. The minimum number of connection points in a Division NTDR  network shall be 900, (three Brigades of 300 NTDRs each). These 300 connection points could be in service at the same time. The term in-service means that a u ser perceives the network to be readily able to deliver any traffic directed toward another users connection point and readily able to accept submitted traffic virtually simultaneously.  The 900 connections within the Division area could route non-critica l traffic between the Brigades and/or Divisions using TMGs. For critical traffic that must flow between the Brigades in the Division, NTDR cross Brigade networking may be utilized to meet the SOS requirements. The NTDR system shall be designed to accommoda te the 900 connection points in the Division and meet SOS requirements for identified users within the Division.

This combined synopsis/solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-11 and DFARS Change Notice 20021220.  Additional information may be obtained at the Fed Biz Opps web site and FAR/DFAR/AFFAR/AFMC FAR SUP on-line, at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, the latter for access to full text of all provisions and clauses.  Vendors are encouraged to use the Standard Form 1449 (provided) as the first page of their offer.  See FAR 52.212-1(b)(11) if you chose not to use this form.  The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items is applicable.  Paragraph (c) is amended to read as follows: The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its proposal firm for 120 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers. The following paragraphs are added to 52.212-1:  (k) OFFERORS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO SUBMIT PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION (PPI) BY 21 Feb 03; HOWEVER, FAILURE TO SUBMIT EARLY WILL NOT RESULT IN AN OFFEROR'S DISQUALIFICATION.  THE PPI MUST BE SUBMITTED NO LATER THAN THE DUE DATE FOR SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS.  FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items is applicable. Paragraph (b) is deleted. The factors identified below are of equal importance to one another. (i) FACTOR 1: PRICE.  The price factor will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness and to the extent to which the proposed labor rates meet AFRL/IF's goal of obtaining qualified technical and professional services at the most affordable price possible. Fairness and Reasonableness ? the degree to which proposed price compares to the price reasonable and prudent person would expect to incur for the same or similar goods or services. (ii) FACTOR 2: PAST PERFORMANCE.  The extent to which the Offeror's past performance met customer requirements, including the Offeror's history of controlling costs, adhering to schedules (including the administrative aspect of performance), reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, and generally the Offeror's business-like concern for the interests of the customer.

The Contracting Officer shall seek and evaluate relevant performance information based on (1) past performance information provided by the Offeror, (2) information obtained from the references provided by the Offeror and/or (3) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Offerors are permitted, but not required, to submit information on significant achievements or to explain past problems that they consider relevant to the proposed service, as well as, past efforts to identify and manage program risk and corrective actions taken.  If offerors have no relevant past performance, the proposal must so state.  If you choose not to use the PPI questionnaire, you are cautioned to complete and provide with your proposal all the data requested in the questionnaire.  The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the service described in this RFP, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.  The assessment process will result in an overall risk rating of exceptional, very good, satisfactory, neutral, marginal, or unsatisfactory.  Offerors with no relevant past performance history shall receive the rating "neutral", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.  Include a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items with your proposal.  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, is applicable.  FAR 52.212-4(a) is amended to read as follows:  "(1) When defects in service cannot be corrected by re-performance, the Government may (i) require the Contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements; and (ii) reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.  (2) If the Contractor fails to promptly perform the services again, or to take the necessary action to ensure future performance in conformity with contract requirements, the Government may (i) By contract or otherwise, perform the services and charge to the Contractor any cost incurred by the Government that is directly related to the performance of such service; or (ii) terminate the contract for cause".

This training would be a follow-up to internal training that was based on a comprehensive examination of 80 questions purchased from BNSF in FY 2002, and would apply the 80-question examination as course lessons that would encompass and contrast the four major codes of operating rules used in the United States.   In addition, BNSF offers classroom facilities which meet the following criteria required by FRA as part of the subject training requirements:

(1) It must have a stepped seating arrangement which will permit all students open viewing of the instructor;

(2) It must have overhead projection surround audio, and the capability of being a full two-way virtual video classroom;

(3) It must enable students to have a full view of both the graphic route illustrations; and the consequences of control manipulations in terms of their effect on train speed, braking capacity, and in-train force levels throughout the train; and

(4) Each student?s workspace must allow for computer hook-ups (power and internet high speed broad band connection with LAN/WAN).

The applicable authority for this announced intention is that under 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, ?Only One Responsible Source.?  This task is NOT a competitive solicitation and a competitive solicitation is NOT available.

The program must include an unlimited user license for internal FRA use, including participating state safety inspection programs, that will enable immediate access to any such regulatory information that exists in the public domain.

<DESC>Requests for Proposals (RFP) N01-CN-25007-72, entitled:  Preclinical Efficacy and Intermediate Endpoint Assays. 

The mission of the Chemopreventive Agent Development Research Group, Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), National Cancer Institute is to identify safe and effective agents for the prevention of human cancers and to develop and qualify these agents for clinical trials.  The DCP is seeking proposals from qualified organizations that have the ability to establish the efficacy of potential cancer preventive agents or agent combinations in a variety of in vivo assays, to identify and validate surrogate intermediate endpoints for clinical trial use, and to establish collaborative groups to conduct these studies.  The studies will assess the potential of various agents to inhibit, reverse, or delay early carcinogenesis by evaluating the effects of these selected agents on a variety of cancers and endpoints,  measuring cancer incidence, multiplicity, tumor size and latency. In addition other studies would address the identification and validation of surrogate intermediate endpoints in animal models for use in clinical trials. The agents to be studied shall include agents developed by the pharmaceutical and other industries and provided to the NCI for collaborative development as well as commercially available agents, agents developed by the NCI, and agents nominated by academic investigators through the RAPID program (http://www.cancer.gov/prevention/rapid/)  The specific goals of this RFP are: 1)  To establish the efficacy of potential cancer preventive agents (or combinations of agents) in various in vivo carcinogenesis assays, measuring the inhibition, reversal, or delay of the carcinogenesis process and, 2)  To identify and validate surrogate intermediate biomarkers for future use in clinical trials using  in vivo assays of experimental carcinogenesis. 

Contracts will be awarded to the offerors who demonstrate the ability to conduct both efficacy and intermediate endpoint bioassays of potential cancer preventive agents in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations Good Laboratory Practices Act and other regulations applicable to pharmaceutical and/or dietary supplement / nutriceutical product development and commercialization.   Offerors must demonstrate that they have knowledge of drug development, preferably in disease prevention, and expertise in  laboratory animal cancer chemoprevention bioassay methods and intermediate endpoint biological, molecular assay, or imaging techniques. Offerors need to provide evidence of their own expertise and access to expertise in such areas as molecular biology, pathology, imaging, statistical analyses, analytical chemistry, and other potentially relevant laboratory methodologies. 

Offerors must submit a proposal that addresses both task areas, that is, Preclinical Efficacy and Intermediate Endpoint Assays.  Only proposals from offerors who demonstrate the capability to perform both Preclinical Efficacy and Intermediate Endpoint Assays will be considered for award.

Contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation will replace the current Efficacy Studies of Chemopreventive Agents in Animal Models and Preclinical Evaluation of Intermediate and their Modulation by Chemopreventive Agents Master Agreement Pools.  Multiple prime contracts will be awarded on a cost-reimbursement completion type basis, with managed Work Assignments.  It is anticipated that four (4) awards will be made and that these contracts will be incrementally-funded with a period of performance of five (5) years.   The Project Officer will initiate Work Assignments which are then forwarded to the Principal Investigator stating the Period of Performance, specific work to be performed and deliverables. Within a specified period the contractor will submit to the Project Officer a detailed description of the technical approach and an estimate of the required costs and effort.  The costs of a Work Assignment will not exceed the  funds currently allocated for this contract.  With the concurrence of the Project Officer and approval by the Contracting Officer, the Work Assignment shall commence. Offerors will have the flexibility to subcontract with additional vendors to provide specific technical expertise that is needed for the  individual Work Assignments.  The duration of each study will depend on the intermediate biomarker assay or the laboratory animal model and will be specified in each Work Assignment. 

The contractor selected shall be responsible for providing the chemopreventive agent except in instances when the NCI wants an agent tested that may not be available to the contractor.  In such cases, the Government shall bear the expense of providing an agent.  The specific work assignment shall specify whether the contractor shall be expected to provide the agent. 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541710.  The RFP will be issued ELECTRONICALLY on or about February 24, 2003.  The RFP will be available on the Research Contracts Branch (RCB) web site at: http://rcb.nci.nih.gov Click on "Current Request for Proposals".

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. 5114-3-0100 is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-12.  The solicitation is 100% set-aside for small businesses.  The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 339111.  For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business standard is 500 employees.  Award will be made to a small business provided that a minimum of two competitive offers are received from small business concerns; if two or more offers are not received from qualified small businesses, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition from among all responsible business concerns submitting offers.  The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Midwest Area, National Animal Disease Center, Ames, Iowa, has a requirement/need  for Ventilated Mouse Racks "Brand Name or Equal" to the Tecniplast SealsafeTM  Models as follows:   2L48MAC30CACP,  2L126MAC30CACP, and  BOX110CP04.  Listed are the description of  items and quantities required: CLIN No. 1 - Model 2L48MAC30CACP, Ventilated Mouse Rack, 48 cages, complete with cage body, wire bar lids, reusable covers, filter paper, water bottles and sipper tubes (1 unit); CLIN No. 2 -  Model 2L126MAC30 CACP, ventilated mouse rack, 126 cages, complete with cage body, wire bar lids, reusable covers, filter paper, water bottles and sipper tubes (6 units); and CLIN No. 3 - Model BOX110CP04, Slim Line Equipment Trolley, with supply and exhaust fan units, HEPA filters and prefilters (5 each).     The mouse caging system will be used for a project to characterize different strains of the agents responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) in livestock, deer and elk.  This involves the inoculation of special inbred mice.  Because TSEs have extremely long incubation periods it is essential that these mice be housed in stress-free situations so they can live out their normal life span.  Therefore, it is important to have a housing system that requires minimal handling of cages (for water, feed and litter changes) and a structure that avoids unnecessary environmental stimulations (such as vibration or noise) that can cause these mice to undergo convulsive seizures and death.  THE SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:  the Ventilated Mouse Racks must meet or include these minimum requirements: (1) The cage racks shall be either single or double-sided; (2) The whole cage rack must be easy to clean, disinfect and sterilize in an autoclave and be lightweight for easy maneuvering with all electrical components mounted in sealed boxes that will withstand disinfecting procedures; (3) Cages must have the ability to be used in either negative or positive pressure with a bag-out filter option; (4) The ventilated cage racks must be of the recirculating type with air diffusing into the top of the cage, not directly on the animals and all exhaust air must be removed not pushed out from the cage via the cage top and all exhaust air from the cage rack must be filtered; (5) Water bottles must be removable from the outside without cage removal; (6) Supply and exhaust unit must mount on a separate trolley in order to eliminate sound and vibration; noise generated from the cage rack fans can not exceed 50dBA and the air supply fans or associated equipment must not cause vibration that can spread to the animal cage; (7) The maximum external dimensions of any cage rack must be 78 x 35 inches with total height not exceeding 84 inches in order to use normal doorways and elevators;  (8) Animal cages and filter tops must be molded using polysulfone plastic and able to stand frequent autoclaving; (9) Must have a portable electrical cord with appropriate plug for connection to wall electrical outlet; and (10) Must have capability for flexible hook-up to ceiling-top in house exhaust system.  The Ventilated Mouse Racks must come complete with cage body, wire bar lids, reusable covers, filter paper, water bottles and sipper tubes.  DESCRIPTIVE LITERATURE:  Offerors shall submit 2 copies of the Descriptive Literature describing their proposed equipment in enough detail to ascertain whether the equipment meets the criteria listed above.  REJECTION OF PROPOSAL:  Failure to demonstrate compliance will be cause to reject the proposal without further discussions.

Technology Enhancements - It is anticipated that the Government's requirement for the equipment described in this contract will extend over several years, perhaps exceeding the technological life of the proposed equipment. It may be in the best interest of the Government, as well as the Contractor, to substitute equipment of a newer technology for the equipment proposed, or some portion thereof, provided that the conditions below are satisfied. During the life of the contract, and under its terms and conditions, the Government may request, or the Contractor may propose to provide, technologically advanced equipment, components, software or any other item(s) contracted hereunder. Types of Upgrades - The upgrades covered by this clause will generally be substituted for functional items/systems already in the contract. The substitution may be in total or in part. The upgrades discussed in this clause are not replacements for items or systems already ordered and installed, and nothing in this clause shall be construed as authority for such replacement of installed equipment. The one exception to this exclusion is software. Installed software will always be eligible for an "upgrade," to allow the Government to maintain currency, consistency, and the compatibility in its software. It is further understood by the parties to this contract that this clause envisages technological refreshment related to the general type of hardware and software covered by the scope of this contract. Minimum Qualifications for Acceptance of Upgrades - The Government is under no obligation to substitute any item for an item already listed in the contract. However, subject to mutual agreement when required above, when items are added to this contract under this clause, the item or items shall meet the following criteria: (1) have been sold to the general public in substantial quantities before substitution under this clause; (2) meet or exceed all mandatory requirements of the contract; (3) be fully compatible with the originally proposed equipment; (4) the price should be equal or less than the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the item. The Contractor shall agree to all terms and conditions, including delivery and installation, being equal to or more favorable to the Government than the substituted equipment; (5) be judged technically acceptable by the COTR; (6) be approved in writing, by execution of a contract modification, signed by both the FBI Contracting Officer and the Contractor's representative; and (7) shall undergo acceptance testing in accordance with the terms of the contract. Pricing of Upgrades - The pricing of upgraded item(s) shall be negotiated on a case-by-case basis provided that the final price shall not exceed the limitations specified above. Delivery of Upgrades - Notwithstanding the delivery requirements set forth above, initial delivery requirements for upgraded items shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties to this contract at the time the upgrade item is added. The Contracting Officer shall have the right to set the delivery schedule based on the longer of the standard commercial delivery schedule of the item(s) or the contract's standard delivery schedule for similar item(s), if a mutually agreeable schedule cannot be met. After the first 60 days, the original contract schedule for delivery takes effect if it is less than the initial agreed upon delivery time. Identification of Technologically Advanced Products - While the Government reserves the right to independently solicit a proposal from the Contractor under the terms of this clause at any time, potential upgrades will normally be brought to the attention of the Government by the Contractor. Offers shall be submitted on an SF-1449 and are due by close of business on February 10, 2003. Please submit any questions, in writing, by January 30, 2003 to Karen Smith at the following facsimile number - (202) 324-5722.

<DESC>As required by 41 U.S.C. 253(f), expressions of interest are sought regarding the Government?s intensions to lease approximately 4,900 usable square feet of office space in Rochester, MN.  The current lease for space located at 21 SW 2nd Street, Rochester, MN is due to expire April 30, 2003. A new lease contract will be created to reflect a 10-year, 5-year firm term.  As relocating would incur substantial moving costs including, but not limited to, systems furniture expenses, information systems costs for equipment upgrades, wiring, installation and setup, physical moving expenses, tenant improvement expenses and contractor costs, it has been determined that it is economically advantageous to have them remain at the current location. If you feel that your first class office space would provide an economically advantageous alternative to the Government, please indicate so by February 28, 2003. Please direct all inquiries to the following: Spaulding & Slye, LLC, 1717 Pennsylvania Avenue, Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20006, Attn:  David Alperstein, GSA Contractor; David_Alperstein@Spauldslye.com; Office:  202-478-2322; Fax: 202-204-3286

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer all questions submitted prior to the closing date of this solicitation.


1.)  I wanted to know if my firm would have a competitive opportunity to win this contract if we have not had previous experience with document destruction services specifically?

If business entity establishment is less than two (2) years, provide related experience of key personnel. Past Performance shall be valued as acceptable, unacceptable, or neutral.

2.) May we use our past experience with much larger contracts that included recycling and document destruction services? 

Yes, if the experience is pertinent to this requirement.

3.) Do you have a sample of a past formatted quote on what the submitted quote should look like? If so, can you send a copy?

There is no mandatory format for the RFQ.  It should contain all information requested in the solicitation.

4.) Do we enter "New Business? for your question or areas to respond to past experience if we have no past experience?

If no past performance information is available the company should indicate this in their offer.

5.) Should my company utilize a subcontractor does the prime contractor need a security clearance as well as the subcontractor?

Yes, only if the prime contractor?s personnel intend to perform any services proposed under the contract.  The Contractor shall submit proof of security clearances and SSF 3237?s (12/02), U.S. Secret Service Contractor Personnel Access Form(s), for all proposed personnel at time of proposal.

6.)

Do you have a copy of SSF 3237 that you could provide or instruct us as to where we can obtain this form?

IRS security clearances do not meet the USSS security clearance requirements.

Each cart can hold approximately 25 burn bags (depending on how full the bags are).  The vendor supplies the carts.  When the vendor arrives they usually bring about 15 carts.  We don't use a set amount at any location, because it changes each time.  

8.) Do you have a copy of the Collective Bargaining Agreements referred to under SCA Minimum Wages and Fringe Benefits?

No, The Service Contract wage rate and labor category will be available prior to contract award.  It is the responsibility of the Contractor under the Collective Bargaining Agreement to provide wage rates.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement. This is NOT an invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Proposal (RFP), or a Request for Application (RFA) and in no way obligates the US Government to award a contract or cooperative agreement.  However, potential sources that may be interested in implementing a sustainable environment program in Brazil are requested to mail, fax, or e-mail their interest to the contact address (listed below) by February 18, 2003.  Potential sources may send a short paragraph with information regarding their capabilities and experience in this field. The United States for International Development (USAID) plans to support a new program that seeks to achieve the conservation of biodiversity and address the threats of climate change associated with land-use change in forested ecosystems, stimulate economic growth, reduce poverty through increased delivery of environmentally sustainable environment services and capacity building and technical cooperation.  Since 1990, USAID/Brazil's Environment Program has improved the prospects for environmentally sound development in the Amazon region.  The global problems of climate change and biodiversity loss have significant local consequences as well.  Ultimately, the global consequences of human activities are grounded in local decisions, and it is at local and, through new technologies, regional levels that constructive interventions can help sway those decisions.  This premise has provided the basis for the USAID/Brazil Environment Program, that will continue to operate through strategically targeted interventions, directed at generating impacts that are local, regional and, ultimately, global in scope.  It is the intent that strategic interventions in the thematic areas be expanded as they offer tremendous opportunity to provide increased benefits to rural poor and shape future land-use trends over large geographic areas of Brazil, while continuing to mitigate the global impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss. Institutions, contractors, for profit and non profit organizations that may be interested in participating in this renewable energy program to be implemented in Brazil are requested to contact USAID/Bolivia.  Interested institutions must be able to achieve results in some or all of the following areas: (i) sustainable natural forest management practices improved and disseminated; (ii) markets for environmental goods and services developed to provide tangible economic benefits for poor communities; and (iii) landscape-level planning that sustains or enhances environmental and socioeconomic benefits integrated into government planning and policies. USAID/Brazil encourages qualified offerors to submit thoughtful and innovative approaches that have a high potential for achievement of the project objectives.  We anticipate issuing the RFA o/a February 24, 2003. Application due date will be April 24, 2003.

This is NOT an invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Proposal (RFP), or a Request for Application (RFA) and in no way obligates the US Government to award a contract or cooperative agreement.

Potential sources may send a short paragraph with information regarding their capabilities and experience in this field. The United States for International Development (USAID) plans to support a new program that seeks to stimulate economic growth, reduce poverty and address climate change effects and other adverse environmental impacts in Brazil through increased delivery of environmentally sustainable energy services and capacity building and technology cooperation. Since 1996, USAID/Brazil has financed an Energy Program supporting the Government of Brazil's (GOB) energy sector restructuring and privatization efforts.  The overarching goal of this program has been to reduce the threats of climate change by focusing on the promotion of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.  While the program has many accomplishments, notably in the fields of policy and regulatory reform and technical capacity building, a number of barriers continue to limit the implementation of these technologies in the marketplace. Despite economic, environmental and societal benefits of renewable energy technologies, the market implementation of these by potential users, governments and utilities has been far short of the potential.
Barriers to the effective application of these technologies include policies that have limited effectiveness in achieving the needed market transformation and private sector participation, perceived economic/financial constraints, social perceptions, and lack of information about these technologies. Institutions, contractors, for profit and non profit organizations that may be interested in participating in this renewable energy program to be implemented in Brazil are requested to contact USAID/Bolivia. Interested institutions must be able to achieve results in some or all of the thematic areas: (i) Policy and Regulation: influence the regulatory aspects of energy sector restructuring to ensure a greater share of renewable energy technologies in Brazil's energy mix; (ii) Technology Cooperation: promote partnerships and exchanges between U.S. and Brazilian firms to design joint activities which utilize renewable energy technologies to meet development objectives; (iii) Market Development for renewable energy: replicate appropriate productive and social applications of these technologies in Brazil, fostering a market-driven demand for renewable energy options; and (iv) Capacity Building: build local capacity to identify, design, implement and manage development project opportunities that incorporate alternative energy as a catalyst to reaching the goals of the project.  USAID/Brazil encourages qualified offerors to submit thoughtful and innovative approaches that have a high potential for achievement of the project objectives.  We anticipate issuing the RFA o/a February 24, 2003. Application due date will be April 24, 2003.

Potential sources may send a short paragraph with information regarding their capabilities and experience in this field. The United States for International Development (USAID) plans to support a new program that seeks to increase the capacity and ability of Brazilian counterparts to effectively promote sustainable energy generation and use through the provision of training and capacity building activities in the following areas: Energy Sector Regulation; Energy Efficiency Concepts & Technologies; Renewable Energy Project Development; and Renewable Energy/Energy Efficiency Financing.  Since 1996, USAID/Brazil has financed an Energy Program supporting the Government of Brazil's (GOB) energy sector restructuring and privatization efforts.  The overarching goal of this program has been to reduce the threats of climate change by focusing on the promotion of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.

Institutions, contractors, for profit and non profit organizations that may be interested in participating in this renewable energy program to be implemented in Brazil are requested to contact USAID/Bolivia. Interested institutions must be able to achieve results in some or all of the thematic areas: (i) Policy and Regulatory Framework: capacity building activities play an important role under this IR as they may be designed to: (a) help identify policies and regulations or lack of enforcement, that pose the most serious impediments to promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency; (b) promote institutional strengthening; and (c) allow for local institutions to learn from international regulatory experiences; (ii) Technology Transfer and Cooperation: workshops, trade missions and invitational travels are key tools for the promotion of U.S.?Brazilian trade and cooperation; and (iii) Market Development: insufficient information about renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies has prevented the development of these two markets in Brazil.  In addition, there is a lack of qualified professionals/entrepreneurs with adequate entrepreneurial capacity to design related projects, prepare business plans and feasibility studies, etc. USAID/Brazil encourages qualified offerors to submit thoughtful and innovative approaches that have a high potential for achievement of the project objectives.  We anticipate issuing the RFP o/a February 24, 2003. Proposals due date will be April 24, 2003.

<DESC>The Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Ship Systems Engineering Station (NSWCCD-SSES), is in the process of standardizing general cleaning materials used aboard U.S. Navy ships. Presently, ships carry a large variety of routine maintenance and shipboard sanitation.  These products can vary in both cleaning efficiency and the degree of safety and health precautions necessary for their use. The overall goal of this initiative is to improve the safety and health aspects (i.e., reduce personal protective equipment requirements (PPE)), and environmental friendliness of the cleaning products that the Navy uses afloat without compromising the mission.  A secondary goal is to reduce the proliferation of numerous authorized cleaning agents listed on the Ship's Hazardous Materials List (SHML).  NSWCCD-SSES is currently in the process of drafting Technical Purchase  Descriptions (TPDs) for furniture polish and carpet cleaners. These two TPDs describing the requirements for the listed cleaning applications are posted on http://www.dt.navy.mil/acquisition.    NSWCCD-SSES is soliciting participation from private industry to review and comment on the attached draft TPDs for the above-mentioned applications over a 30-day period ending 10 March 2003.  Based on these responses, TPDs will be revised to reflect applicable industry comments. NSWCCD-SSES is also interested in determining what products are presently commercially available that qualify to these TPD requirements.  All interested vendors may forward comments and product information for cleaning agents that qualify to the performance requirements of the TPDs to Ms. Christine Socha (215) 897-7499 or Ms. Sarah Phillips (215)897-7401, fax (215) 897-1664.

<DESC>I.  INTRODUCTION   
Bechtel, BWXT Idaho LLC (BBWI), Management and Operating Contractor of the Idaho National Engineering & Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), is requesting an Expression Off Interest (EOI) from prospective vendors to provide services for company level document rewrite and reorganization. This EOI serves as a method of identifying potential vendors; identifying general qualifications and capabilities; and receiving rough order of magnitude (ROM) quotes to allow BBWI to make decisions concerning viability of subcontracting this effort versus performing this scope with BBWI personnel. More than one vendor may be used for the differing requirements of this activity, and the full scope may be subdivided and performed by a combination of subcontractor and BBWI personnel.

II.  BACKGROUND   
Company level documents (primarily procedures) at the INEEL, a Department of Energy (DOE) site, need to be overhauled. The document hierarchy may also need to be reworked. The company level documents will be aligned to newly developed Management System documents. These Management System documents describe, at the highest level, how business at the INEEL is to be performed. There will be approximately 500 - 700 company level documents (assume an average 22 pages per document) that will need to be evaluated for rewrite applicability. 

III.  PERFORMANCE CRITERA   
The scope and requirements for this effort may extend over a 3 ? 5 year duration and will include: 

1) Evaluate existing company level documents for proper content based on ?to be developed? templates and guidelines for acceptable content, 
2) Ensure company level documents can be aligned under existing Management System documents, 
3) Work with each organization (within a Management System) owning or being affected by the document to generate new company level documents or revise existing company level documents to conform to predefined format and content, while ensuring work processes maintain continuity, 
4) Ensure documents contain all source requirements, defined as the necessary requirements dictated by INEEL?s contract, other regulatory and stakeholder requirements, and best business practices applied by the INEEL contractor, 
5) Ensure documents are ?user friendly? and contain ?must have? information (source requirement), not ?nice to have?, finding and eliminating repetitive and / or conflicting information across company level documents, and maintaining a consistent level of detail, 
6) Develop an implementation strategy and plan to ?roll-out? the new / revised company level documents with minimal impact to everyday business and operations, which will require coordinating with each organization to ensure that lower tier documents are aligned with new / revised company level documents and the ?roll-out? is scheduled to allow lower tier documents to stay current to new / revised company level documents such that compliance and process flow are not compromised (this function shall be performed under INEEL management oversight), 
7) Develop migration plans and schedules that establish how and when the new procedures will replace company-level legacy documents (schedules shall place the highest priority on filling compliance gaps and identify where the Management System?s required information will fit within the new hierarchy), 
8) Work with company level documents encompassing administrative and technical documents for organizations and functional categories provided in the table below:

Company Level Document Categories
Legal Services, Human Resources, Labor Relations, Public Relations, Business Management, Supply Chain Management and Contracts, Financial Operations, Environmental Management and Restoration, Research and Development, Nuclear Programs and Site Operations, Infrastructure and Maintenance, Engineering,Project Management, Construction Management,Planning and Controls, 
Support Services, Information Resource Management, Quality Assurance, Environmental Affairs, Occupational Medicine, Radiological Controls, Performance Assurance, Occupational Safety and Health, Industrial Hygiene, Safeguards & Security, Emergency Services.	
	 
IV.  SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS  
It is the intent of this EOI to identify candidate vendors who have previous experience in providing similar services. Prospective vendors shall provide 1) a description of current capabilities and experience in document evaluation, rewrite, and implementation including whether experience includes DOE or government application and experience in the respective company level document organization / function (i.e. desirable to have Quality Assurance experience to work on Quality Assurance documents, identify those that you do not wish to pursue or have experience to support), 2) an ROM estimate, subdivided by the total number of qualified employees you would like considered, and for which category of document, per year, with a basis for the ROM estimate (i.e. an estimate of cost per document and how many documents the vendor estimates could be worked per year based on it?s resources and previous experience, etc.). The intent of this EOI is to identify prospective vendors who can provide services for company level document rewrite and reorganization of this scope and magnitude. Teaming arrangements are permissible. Once viability of subcontracting part or all of this scope is determined by BBWI, a detailed RFP will be issued for the scope to be subcontracted, including specific qualification requirements. 

Please provide your EOI submittal to Todd Alasin (alastk@inel.gov), (208) 526-4689 by close of business, Monday, February 24, 2003.

<SUBJECT>J -- HVAC Maintenance
<DESC>The 377th Contracting Squadron/LGCM intends to award a sole source contract to Honeywell, Inc. for onsite HVAC maintenance at Kirtland AFB, NM.  Currently, Honeywell Inc, is responsible for HVAC maintenance in approximately 144 buildings under Kirtland?s Energy Saving Performance Contract (ESPC), contract No.F29650-99-D-0001, which is available for review from the Kirtland AFB Contracting Flight, 377 CONS/LGCM, at (505) 846-5705.  Under the ESPC contract, Honeywell provides capital improvement to:  (a) perform energy audits of selected facilities for energy retrofit opportunities; (b) prepare and present to the government for approval a proposal for implementation of a financially viable energy conservation project (ECP); (c) design and install the ECP equipment; and (d) maintain the ECP equipment they install and any HVAC equipment that existed at award for the life of the contract.  Payment to Honeywell is based on the energy savings realized during the course of the contract.  These payments cover the cost of the ECPs and also include anticipated maintenance cost for the existing equipment.  Funds for contract payments are taken from Kirtland?s utility budget.  If these savings are not realized, the government may reduce the payment to Honeywell by an amount not to exceed the savings shortfall.  In addition to the energy savings Honeywell is also responsible for maintaining the buildings at a certain temperature.  To ensure the savings are realized and that the temperatures are maintained in accordance with the contract it is imperative that the HVAC equipment be continually maintained for optimum performance.  Since the award of the ESPC, the Air Force's ongoing construction and modernization program for the aging facilities on the base have added, deleted, or modified the HVAC equipment in ESPC facilities that Honeywell is responsible for.  Although these changes are allowed under the basic ESPC contract, paragraph C.13, the ESPC contract does not require Honeywell to repair and maintain the new equipment added by the government and does not allow for O&M funds to be added to cover the maintenance cost of any new equipment installed by these projects.  The maintenance and repair service for the HVAC equipment added by the government since ESPC award shall consist of the following requirements:
?	The existing single point of service, the Civil Engineering service call desk, shall be the initiation point for all service calls.  The service call desk is operated by Chugach Management Services, Joint Venture (CMSJV).  CMSJV also provides civil engineer services to Kirtland AFB.  Honeywell provides HVAC maintenance and repair in facilities under its contract, and the new contract would provide HVAC maintenance and repair service to any additional HVAC equipment in the ESPC facilities installed by the government.  CMSJV is also responsible for ductwork and piping systems in ESPC facilities.
?	The new contract shall require the use of the government work tracking computer system (currently IWIMS).
?	Response time for the new contract must match the ESPC contract.  At a minimum, telephone response to a service call shall be within 1 hour, and arrival on site shall be within 24 hours, or 4 hours for emergency repairs (defined as work needed to prevent damage to government facilities or equipment, work needed to prevent injury to personnel, or work needed to prevent adversely affecting the government's mission).  For some facilities, the emergency repair response time is 1 hour and the repair time is not to exceed 8 hours (if 8 hours is exceeded, provision for temporary heating/cooling must be made).
?	The contract will require the expertise to repair and maintain Honeywell Excel 5000 direct digital control/energy management and control system (DDC/EMCS) equipment.  All DDC/EMCS software programming is done by Honeywell, and Honeywell is responsible for EMCS monitoring.  Contractor must work with Honeywell for remote EMCS access.
?	All maintenance and repair of equipment under this service contract shall be in accordance with manufacturer's published maintenance and repair data, and performed to a high commercial level as will be set forth in the statement of work for this contract.  Equipment must be maintained at new efficiency levels so that the savings for the ESPC contract is not lost.
?	No on base space will be provided as part of this contract.
?	The initial contract scope will be for selected pieces of HVAC equipment in an estimated 8-12 buildings.
The following are the government's concerns if this contract is not awarded to Honeywell.  Any statements of capability must address these concerns:
?	Award of this contract to a contractor other than Honeywell will result in 2 contractors having maintenance and repair responsibility for the HVAC equipment in a single facility.  To meet required response and repair times, both contractors may have to respond to service calls, although in general only a single contractor will ultimately have to make repairs.  This dual response will increase cost to the government.
?	Because another contractor?s failure to maintain HVAC equipment could adversely effect energy savings in covered facilities, award of this contract to a contractor other than Honeywell may limit or eliminate the government's ability to enforce performance provisions of the Honeywell contract, specifically reduction in payment to Honeywell if energy savings are not achieved.
This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet this requirement.  Responses are due by           10 March 2003 and shall be submitted to 377 CONS/LGCM, 2000 Wyoming SE, Kirtland AFB, NM.  If you have any questions, please contract the Contract Administrator, Ms. Katherine Weber, 505-846-5705 or Contracting Officer, Ms. Sheri Szpunar, 505-846-5680.  If no responses are received a sole source award will be made to Honeywell, Inc.

<SUBJECT>A -- Durable Silver Mirror Coating Technology
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS COLLABORATIVE R & D PARTNERS TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE DURABLE SILVER MIRROR COATING TECHNOLOGY

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), seeks collaborative research and development partner(s) to further develop and commercialize its durable silver mirror coating technology. Potential applications for this technology include astronomical instrument mirrors (telescopes, spectrometers, etc.); optical-based instrumentation with mirror surfaces (i.e. spectrometers); cameras; solar reflectors; photocopiers; high-efficiency gratings; and all commercial applications requiring a high-reflectance mirror.

The Vacuum Process Group at LLNL has developed and patented a process that keeps silver mirror coatings from tarnishing even in extremely harsh environments. By utilizing optical properties of both aluminum and silver metals, LLNL has designed a durable silver mirror coating that is flexible and highly reflective from the ultraviolet to the far infrared. The coatings can also be applied to various substrates such as glass, plastics, and metals.  The coating process has been used to deposit durable silver mirror coatings in a space-bound camera and several astronomical telescopes, as well as, the flashlamp reflective surfaces for the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at LLNL.

A family of mirror coating processes has been developed that far exceeds all military specifications for chemical and mechanical testing. Experiments performed at LLNL predict the films should last for tens of years, even in harsh environments. The new family of durable mirror designs offers a variety of reflection versus bandwidth options that can accommodate all wavelengths of light from 200 nm in the ultraviolet to 8mm in the far infrared. 

Additional technical information can be obtained at the Mirror Coating Technology Website http://www-eng.llnl.gov/silver_mirror/index.html.

Also see U. S. Patent 6,078,425, ?Durable Silver Coating for Mirrors?, issued 6/20/00. LLNL is in the process of filing additional patent applications.

 
Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in developing and commercializing LLNL's durable silver mirror coating technology for should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.

<SUBJECT>R -- USJFCOM RE-ENGINEERING OF JOINT DEPLOYMENT PROCESS
<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to announce a U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) Joint Deployment Process Owner (JDPO) request for information (RFI) from industry.  The intent of the RFI is to identify capability and concepts for reengineering 'end-to-end' joint deployment/redeployment processes and architecture through use of industry standard Business Process Reengineering (BPR) methodologies.  

Ultimate Objective of BPR Initiative:
The ultimate objective of the BPR initiative is to comprehensively reengineer process activities spanning strategic, operational and tactical levels as well as activities to enable movement of force capability from origin to final destination. This includes all activities in the currently doctrinally defined (Joint Publication 3-35, Deployment/Redeployment) phases consisting of pre-deployment activities, movement to and activities at the port of embarkation, movement to the port of debarkation, joint, reception, staging, onward movement and integration, and redeployment.  

The desired outcome from the BPR initiatives include fully documented and implemented integrated architectures associated with the reengineered process, identification of changes required to existing doctrine, policy, regulations or guidelines identified to implement the reengineered processes/procedures design of a new process to streamline the existing process, creating greater speed, accuracy, visibility, and agility while aiming for a 'seamless' environment.  

Information Requested:
JDPO is not in the development or BPR business and seeks capabilities, methodologies and approach concepts to develop an understanding of what is available in industry as it relates to JDPO and BPR.  Therefore, submissions should include the description of an approach to achieve the reengineering objectives of the JDPO/BPR process.  

The deliverables from this RFI should include a brief 'white paper' description of your reengineering capability and approach that fits the requirements described above.  The response should normally be 15 pages or less and should describe how your company would approach this requirement to meet the outcomes described.  The following information is available as attachments to this announcement:  
-High-Level Operational Concept Graphic
-Operational Information Exchange Matrix
-Joint Deployment Operational Architecture

Your recommended approach should meet the following core principals: 

-Identify the difficulties and deficiencies in producing critical outputs/products associated with the existing end-to-end joint deployment process;
-Analysis of alternative methods and process that would eliminate the deficiencies associated with the current process;
-Description and depiction of the integrated architectures that identify the alternative methods and processes that have been incorporated into a reengineered 'to be' joint deployment process; 
-Transition strategy that identifies the implications for changes to doctrine, policy, regulation, guidance, training, and systems in order to transition to the reengineered process;
-Priority and feasibility matrix for implementation and methodology to implement and enforce operational capability objectives. 

THIS REQUEST IS FOR INFORATION ONLY.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATON SOLICITED.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as result of the submission of industry information. As industry may see portions of submitted information in future solicitations, NO PROPRIETARY OR COPYRIGHT INFORMATION SHALL BE SUBMITTED.  In addition, you may submit information regarding existing contracts where your reengineering services are available under GSA contracts. 

Response Submission Procedure:
Those interested in responding to this RFI should submit responses to paul.phelps@jfcom.mil.  USJFCOM/JDPDO will accept responses for two weeks from the date of this CBC announcement (actual date shown above).

<SUBJECT>70 -- Request for Information
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking information in accordance with FAR Part 15.201 to identify software that will save time and effort by scanning narratives (varying between a few sentences to a few paragraphs), recognizing key words and phrases, displaying key words to the user (highlighting and extracting), and recommending corrected or preferred terms for each word or phase. The software will be used for the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition?s (CFSAN) Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS) a passive, post-marketing surveillance system that brings together all adverse event reports and consumer complaints concerning CFSAN monitored products into one database. Previously, these reports are received and stored among various offices with no way of compiling comprehensive reports. The goal is to have a single repository for adverse event reports and consumer complaints concerning CFSAN monitored products so that trends and unusual occurrences can be recognized among the thousands of reports received. The ability to create reports using any criteria based on the recorded data fields within a very short period of time is required. All of this requires that data is received and entered properly. Data will be entered by data entry personnel. This includes the recognition of key symptoms and descriptions so that the information is entered in a complete and standardized manner for easy retrieval and analysis later. Since the reports that come to CAERS number in the thousands, having a tool for keyword extraction would theoretically simplify data entry, make it more cost effective, and increase accuracy. The software shall be compatible with Oracle Data Base (DB) and Thesaurus Management System (TMS), use Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activity (MedDRA) with regular updates, suggest terms (fuzzy searches), provide key word extraction function, be able to support user created synonym tables, retrieve hierarchy, have and open source code, be easily and regularly updated, and have simplified Graphic User Interaction (GUI). The FDA is requesting information on past performance, related products, customer/product support, management of integration and fine tuning products, contract types, troubleshooting, product specification and system requirements. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. Responses to this Request For Information are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract they are for information only.  Questions shall be sent to Ida Cofield by fax 301/827-7039 or E-mail icofield@oc.fda.gov.
