NAVSUP WSS does not possess the necessary engineering drawing masters, developmental specifications, engineering change data, interface specifications, etc. required to source these parts to another vendor other than Lockheed Martin. NAVSUP WSS does not have required Navy technical support activity (TSA) or in-service engineering support approval to parts procured or repaired by sources other than Lockheed Martin. Data is not currently available for competition. Lockheed Martin provided detailed analysis and justification for value-added parts which was reviewed by the AN/UYQ-70(V) host ISEA community. This review was performed to see if parts could be properly broken out without negatively impacting host weapon system certification, configuration management and operating systems. The review revealed that the Government does not possess the in-depth technical knowledge; or the required technical documentation; or it is not up-to-date; or it is incomplete in content for full and open competition. Configuration control of commercial parts is insufficient when purchase from sources other than the Q-70 system integrator. The integrator has the necessary operational, design, configuration management, integration and engineering knowledge when purchasing, building and repairing Q-70 parts for hosted systems. ***SOURCE APPROVAL*** LOCKHEED MARTIN IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY APPROVED SOURCE OF SUPPLY FOR THESE ITEMS.
