<DESC>The Office of Dietary Supplements, OD, National Institutes of Health, intends to negotiate a five year contract with the National Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA) to expand the NNFA’s proprietary database of dietary supplement labels, so as to include all dietary supplement labels sold in the United States.  This existing database system will be further enhanced so as to support research and allow the entire general public free and unfettered access to dietary supplement label information.  The expansion will require the updating, expansion, and maintenance of an entire system: database structures, user interfaces, business logic, and other interactive components.  Since 1990, the National Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA) has operated a proprietary dietary supplement label database entitled the TruLabel database.  Members of the NNFA provide information on products they manufacture and sell.  The NNFA database is the largest of its kind in the industry.  Statutory authority: 41 U.S.C. 253 ( c ) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The cited authority is applicable because NNFA has and maintains a dietary supplement labels database and it is the largest of its kind in the industry.  See Numbered Note 22.

The Contractor shall be responsible to disconnect, remove (and/or cap), and identify utilities within the demolition area.  The local utility company shall be notified of the demolition work in advance and in accordance with utility company requirements.  Location of capped utilities shall be marked and shown on the record demolition drawings. The estimated price for this work is between $25,000.00 and $100,000.00. The North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) for this project is 238910; Site Preparation Contractors (includes Demolition, building and structure).  The size standard for this NAICS is $12 million. This project is for demolition, which is considered a service, not construction.  However, the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program will be applied to this contracting action (see Federal Acquisition Regulation subpart 19.10).  Therefore, this contracting action will be issued unrestricted. The tentative RFQ issue date is July 22, 2005.  Note: The RFQ documents will be available electronically on the Department of Interior website at http://ideasec.nbc.gov and also on the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fedbizopps.gov.   Paper copies WILL NOT be available.

<SOLNBR>701815R046
<RESPDATE>072205
<ARCHDATE>07082006
<CONTACT>Paul Griffin Contract Specialist 9077863818     paul_griffin@fws.gov;
<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7 (Alaska) intends to award a sole source procurement to R.G. Ford Consulting Company to provide professional pre-assessment consultation on the impacts to birds resulting from the Seledang Ayu ship grounding and subsequent oil spill that occured during the winter of 2004/2005 along the coast of Western Alaska.  This information is neccessary so that the Service and other trustees can determine whether injuries resulting from the oil spill can be addressed with feasable primary and/or compensatory restoration activities. The Service is responding to the grounding of the 738-foot cargo vessel M/V Selendang Ayu, off Unalaska Island in the Aleutian Islands. The vessel, carrying approximately 483,000 gallons of heavy bunker fuel oil and 21,000 gallons of diesel fuel, ran aground and broke apart on Wednesday, December 8. Six of the vessel's crew members were lost in the rescue effort. The vessel is located between Skan Bay and Spray Cape (53° 38' 04", 167° 07' 30") on the western shore of Unalaska. The area is accessible only by water or air.  The lands in the spill area are managed as part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. The Service Regional Spill Response Coordinator is directing the Service response from Dutch Harbor, Alaska. The Service response efforts are being conducted within the Unified Incident Command Structure, and Service biologists are directing wildlife response activities within this joint command. The number of birds recovered during an oil spill response typically represnts a subset of the total mortality. Many of the birds that are killed by an oil spill are not recovered, and some of the bird carcasses that are recovered may not have been attrutable to the spill.  Estimating the total mortality involves correcting for factors that result in carcass disapperance before being recovered by researchers and estimating the rate at shich carcasses are deposited in the adsence of an oil spill. R.G. Ford Consulting will compile and analyze information gathered by the Service and other trustee agencies that includes background seabird mortality, searcher efficiency, and scavaging rates.  R.G. Ford Consulting will use data from reference beaches to establish scavaging and searcher efficiency rates that can be applied to the spill area. A final written report will be generated after all information has been examined.  The final report will contain the following: a) Name and address of the client b) Name and address of the analysts c) Description of the methods used to determine final estimates of seabird mortality d)  Summary results and conclusions This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accept proposals received.  Award will be made 15 days following the publication of this notice, on or shortly after July 25, 2005.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>This is a notice of our intent to award a contract on a noncompetitve basis to the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) for the following services. a)	Concept Development - Research, development, prototyping, engineering design, and studies of technologies (e.g., sensors, instrumentation, devices, materials, technology, displays, and informatics) necessary to survive, acquire data, and perform required functions in the lunar, planetary, and space environments. b)	Systems Engineering and Analysis - Systems engineering activities essential to defining problems and requirements, assessing or devising technical approaches and concepts, and developing baselines (e.g., models, architectures, specifications) useful for continued development and/or integration.  This includes performing bench marking and evaluation activities such as critical experiments, analyses, simulations, trade studies, and tests. c)	Advanced Engineering Development - Development, fabrication, and deployment of advanced prototype flight hardware. d)	Project Management Assistance - Oversight, assessment, and assistance to NASA program management and contractors engaged in research, development, fabrication, launch processing, operational deployment, and sustaining engineering activities relating to space exploration. e)	Basic and Applied Research – Research and development necessary to acquire a fundamental understanding of lunar surface and subsurface constituents, terrain features, and characteristics of the lunar environment.  Research and development necessary to acquire a fundamental understanding of similar attributes of celestial bodies being considered for exploration.   The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3), to maintain essential engineering, research, and development capability to be provided by an educational or other non-profit institution.  More specifically, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center requires that the essential NASA-related capabilities established at JHU/APL be maintained as authorized in FAR 6.302-3(b)(2)(ii).  Specific expertise resident at JHU/APL in the development of precision space navigation and communication systems, and the application of that expertise in the development of navigation and communication infrastructure systems in the form of prototype small, mini, and micro-satellites is essential to successful accomplishment of the NASA exploration mission.  JHU/APL’s status as a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) gives it a unique and trusted standing within the industry, and allows JHU/APL to function as an extension of a program or project office in providing oversight and problem solving capability in conjunction with traditional aerospace contractors in a manner that ensures the best interests of the government and the contractors are protected.  In addition, the JHU/APL’s expertise in lunar science investigation provides an essential component to future expeditions to the lunar environment.  It is intended that lunar navigation and communication infrastructure assets be designed in consonance with scientific exploration initiatives by accommodating the requirements of scientific payloads and experiments. The synergistic development of exploration infrastructure and accomplishment of scientific investigation on and around the lunar surface is a prominent tenet of future systems development. These services are not available elsewhere in a UARC or Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) environment in their entirety and, while not quantifiable, could not be duplicated without substantial investment of effort and other resources over a period of years.  The essential capabilities sought to be maintained include JHU/APL’s ability to provide independent evaluation required by NASA while at the same time working closely with industry, including the transition of the technology to industry.	 The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 p.m. (noon) local time on July 25, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	If responding to this synopsis, interested firms should address the following capabilities as related to the desired services described in items a through e.  Responses should be thorough, but succinct. 1.	Experience in acting as a “trusted agent” of the government that would not be viewed as a competitor to contractors engaged in a traditional contractual relationship with NASA.  The trusted agent would act on behalf of NASA in the development of requirements and provide insight/oversight of traditional contractors. 2.	Facilities and personnel, including facilities clearance and personnel clearances, to conduct analyses and develop systems classified as Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmental Information, and to work with other government agencies and contractors engaged in classified work. 3.	Demonstrated capability to rapidly conceive, develop, fabricate, and operate advanced technology prototype spacecraft systems. 4.	Demonstrated expertise in the development of precision space navigation and communication infrastructure. 5.	Scientific expertise specific to exploration of the lunar environment and is the firm recognized as a leader in this field within the larger scientific community. 6.	Relevant organizational structure, locations, and major technical capabilities as related to this activity. 7.	Cost, schedule, and performance history of comparable work. 8.	Experience in the use of successful Earned Value Management (EVM) systems including a statement of government certification that your system is compliant with NASA or DoD EVM system criteria. Responses received after the due date will be considered nonresponsive to this synopsis and will not be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract on a full and open competition basis based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit a response which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA intends to award negotiate and award a contract to Ilex Engineering, Inc., 9250 Bendix Road North, Columbia, MD  21056 under the authority FAR 6.302-1 through solicitation EA133E-05-RQ-1526. Only one responsible source is available to satisfy the agency requirement for (1) each Graphical User Interface to LRGS and LRIT-Data Collection System (DCS) System as required by the WCDAS Operations, NESDIS, Wallops Command and Acquisition Station, Wallops, VA. The Low Resolution Information Transfer (LRIT) system is used to transmit a continual stream of products to the NOAA GOES spacecraft.  The LRIT uplink to the GOES spacecraft is unique in that it is dedicated to the Wallops facility.  The DCS data is transferred from Wallops to the Suitland Facility where data is assimilated into the LRIT stream as a whole.  The transfer of DCS data to Suitland is critical in that Wallops is the only source Suitland has for its DCS data input.  Ilex Engineering developed the LRIT software (which assimilates and transmits the data).  Ilex has thorough knowledge of the system’s code and the overall development of the software. This is a 100% smallbusiness set-aside. Interested small businesses may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The small business size for the above NAICS code is $12.5 million.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  All information received by 4:00 p.m., EST, 07/26/05 will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Michele.A.McCoy@noaa.gov.  See Note 22.

According to the language included in FAR Case 2001-026, vendors are required to use ORCA beginning 1 January 2005.  Detailed information can be found in the FAR Case, as well as by visiting the Help section of the website at http://orca.bpn.gov. The help section includes ORCA background information, frequently asked questions (FAQ), the ORCA Handbook, and whom to call for assistance.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) intends to award a sole source contract to Williams Fairey Engineering Limited (WFEL), P. O. Box 41 Crossley Road Heaton Chapel, Stockport Cheshire SK4 5BD England.  This sole source award will be made to design, fabricate, deliver, and provide analysis and set-up documentation for a Ski Jump Ramp in support of flight test operations of the F-35B Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing (STOVL) Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) aircraft, which weighs approximately 62,000 lbs.  A Ski Jump is used to assist STOVL aircraft during shipboard takeoffs.  This land based Ski Jump will be used to exercise the F-35B STOVL JSF prior to conducting shipboard testing. The contract requires expertise in the design of structures to withstand the complex dynamic loads imparted by a STOVL aircraft during Ski-Jump Takeoffs and in the design and production of structures that limit the risk of Foreign Object Damage (FOD) to an aircraft.  The requirement involves design, production, and delivery of equipment, analysis, and documentation products to provide a Ski Jump Test Capability. A sole source acquisition is required under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) due to WFEL’s unique experience in Ski Jump structures, specialized production expertise, and critical appreciation of aircraft-compatible design requirements.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Electromagnetics Division, Boulder CO proposed to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Tekhnoscan Joint Stock Company, Novosibirsk, Russia for a Ti:Sapphire ring laser with external cavity stabilization.
NIST’s future experiments on Bose-Einstein Condensates require a single-frequency, narrow linewidth, wavelength-tunable, high power laser source. The laser will be applied for coherent optical manipulation of ultracold atoms (Bose-Einstein condensates). NIST will confine the Bose-Einstein condensates in interference structures made from several intersecting beams originating from the same laser. Such precise manipulation requires single-frequency laser operation and very high emission frequency stability. Required laser powers to achieve sufficient confinement of the Bose-Einstein condensate are in the range of 1W. A CW Ti:Sapphire ring laser is the only laser source that provides these features.  The TIS-SF-077 from Tekhnoscan is a Ti:Sapphire ring laser that meets all the above requirements. It provides greater than 1W of stable single-frequency output power over nearly all the required wavelength range from 720 to 850 nm. The delivery time shall be less than 60 days ARO.
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000). This notice is for information purposes only. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether on not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Anticipated award date is July 25, 2005.

This narrow-banding effort must be complete and in place by the end of 2006 to meet federal government requirements.  Due to the critical nature of the SSC trunked radio system and its requirement to support, safety, health and welfare of the SSC environment and the proprietary nature of the existing system we have chosen Motorola Incorporated  to plan, engineer and install this upgrade. Motorola’s expertise in the design and installation of health and safety related trunked radio systems is recognized throughout the world and the proprietary nature and criticality of the existing system to SSC’s mission dictates the transition of existing components to the new 12.5khz frequency band be flawless, without service interruptions and have the most experienced technical staff available.   This is a Commercial Item Acquisition under FAR Part 12.  This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The Government believes only one responsible source can provide the service that will satisfy the agency requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on July 18, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Solicitation NNS05120926Q will be issued to Motorola Incorporated on  July 19, 2005, with a response due no later than July 26, 2005.

<DESC>See Commerce Business Daily Note 22.  Notice of intent to award a sole source contract.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to issue a sole source contract to the Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) at the Monterey Institute of International Studies (MIIS), 460 Pierce Street, Monterey, CA,  93940 for an effort entitled “Nonproliferation Study In The Area of Weapons of Mass Destruction.”  The objective of this effort will be to leverage upon previous work conducted by CNS/MIIS to support DTRA’s mission of conducting strategic studies and analyses related to national and international security, chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological, high-yield explosives (CBRNE) threats, homeland defense, and the global war on terrorism.  
This effort includes state and non-state proliferation-related activities, and the means and capabilities necessary to effectively and efficiently combat both current and potential CBRNE threats.  CNS/MIIS will conduct research, analyses, conferences, and provide expert services that encompass a wide range of WMD subjects in which CNS has unique expertise to meet the requirements of the Statement of Objectives, such as WMD threat anticipation, preparation, prevention, defense, reduction, nonproliferation, counter proliferation, consequence management, arms control and disarmament treaties and agreements, safety and security of WMD, and WMD development, production, deployment, transfers, reductions, and terrorism.  This effort will build upon research and analysis conducted between 2002 to 2004.  During this period CNS/MIIS developed vital expertise and provided DTRA with comprehensive monitoring and analysis regarding global nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons issues, missile proliferation, and terrorist groups.  CNS/MIIS monitored the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and their delivery missile systems (NBC/M) in which CNS/MIIS provided research and analysis on threats posed by the spread of NBC/M, its causes, ways to respond, and future challenges, including those involving Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), terrorism and ways to reduce the threats of WMD terrorism.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS, AND NO FORMAL SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

<DESC>1.  The Project: NOAA has a requirement for LIDAR hydrographic surveying services to support nautical charting and related products for the coastal and adjacent ocean areas of the United States (including possessions and territories), the Great Lakes and other inland navigable waters.  One three-year indefinite delivery contract, at an estimated $10 million per year, is scheduled for award in FY 2006 with performance of first work order commencing in 2006.  Work orders under this contract will consist of but are not limited to: 1) acquiring shallow water airborne hydrographic LIDAR sounding data; 2) acquiring shoreline and coastal topographic LIDAR; 3) installing, operating, and removing water level (tide) stations; 4) acquiring related supporting data (e.g. water level correctors, secchi depth readings, etc.); 5) processing the data, including tidal tabulation, computation of tidal datums, tidal zoning determination, applying water level correctors to determine the true depths, and compiling reports, final smooth sheets, and digital data; and 6) performing quality control during data acquisition and processing; and 7) the delivery of the data, reports, and sheets to NOAA for archival and application to the nautical charts and associated nautical products.  All work shall be performed to NOAA specifications and the data provided in NOAA specified formats.  See http://chartmaker.ncd.noaa.gov/hsd/specs/specs.htm for typical technical specifications and a description of the deliverables. The final statement of work will tailor these specifications for each work order issued.  A quality control plan will be a contract requirement.  Potential vendors are encouraged to review the technical specifications and a description of the deliverables before responding to this announcement. This contract will permit that a Government COTR or observer be present during aircraft operations.  

2. Selection Criteria:  Firm must provide sufficient surveying equipment and sufficient technical, supervisory, and administrative personnel to ensure expeditious prosecution of work assignments.  Participation by firms qualifying as small, small disadvantaged, and/or women-owned small businesses will be one of the factors of consideration in the selection process. To be considered for selection, a firm must demonstrate surveying experience in the types of surveys stated above and have on payroll at least two hydrographers and a tides/water level specialist. The two hydrographers must each have a minimum of three years experience in surveying using shallow water airborne hydrographic LIDAR systems and interpreting the data.  The tides/water level specialist must have demonstrated experience in measurement of tides and water levels, tidal datums, and tidal zoning and their application to hydrographic surveying.  Firms must show the availability of a suitable aircraft that complies with applicable FAA, ICAO, and other applicable state and federal regulations; data acquisition and processing systems; shallow water airborne hydrographic LIDAR system capable of detecting contacts measuring 2m x 2m x 1m high and capable of measuring water depths to 50 meters; GPS surveying equipment for establishing horizontal control; differential GPS equipment for aircraft positioning; water level measurement gauges; topographic lidar system.  

Evaluation criteria, in descending order of importance, are:  (1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services; (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required; (3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time (personnel and equipment); (4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules; (5) Location and knowledge: capability to work in diverse types of localities in the U.S., especially in Alaska; and (6) Proposed plans to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities on this project to small, small-disadvantaged, and/or women-owned small business concerns.  Evaluation criteria #6 will not apply to small business firms because subcontracting plans are not required from those concerns pursuant to FAR 19.702(b).  

Responding firms are requested to state whether they are a small, small disadvantaged business, women-owned, HUBZone, veteran owned, or service disabled veteran-owned small business. Responding firms are encouraged to use small business concerns in a meaningful manner in the execution of this project.  Large business firms should demonstrate their commitment and discuss proposed plans to provide subcontracting opportunities to the small business community in the performance of this project.  

 
Specific abilities and disciplines required on this contract include (but are not limited to):  Project Manager, Hydrographer experienced with lidar systems, Tides/Water Level Specialist, Land Surveyor, and GIS Specialist (Geographers/Cartographer/Geospatial Data Analyst).  Firms should indicate their experience using a shallow water airborne hydrographic LIDAR system and provide an outline of how the Prime contractor will manage their team to ensure that quality products are delivered to NOAA.  For evaluation factor (3) Capacity, a list of key personnel demonstrating their availability for the project considering other commitments and major equipment available for project assignment must be provided along with other pertinent data.  The operating specifications of the shallow water airborne hydrographic LIDAR system and the topographic LIDAR system must be included.  

3. Submission:  All responsible sources may submit a response for consideration by NOAA.  Prime contractors shall respond to this announcement for their teams.

OVERVIEW
Fort Monmouth is a U. S. Army Installation located approximately fifty (50) miles south of New York City, New York.  Established in 1917, the Installation was initially designated Signal Corps Camp, Little Silver, before the name was changed to Camp Alfred Vail, in honor of the New Jersey inventor. In 1925, the Post was officially designated Fort Monmouth, in honor of the men who had died on the nearby Revolutionary War battlefield. Today, Fort Monmouth is home to the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command, the Army Information Systems Management Activity, the Army Chaplain Center and School, the U.S. Military Academy Preparatory School and the Joint Interoperability Engineering Organization. 
The Installation's population includes approximately 820 active duty military personnel, 6,110 civilian government employees, 3,500 permanent Government contractors and about 1,650 military dependents. Fort Monmouth covers an estimated 637 acres at the Main Post and 464 acres at the Charles Wood Area, located 1-1 ½ miles away.

ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
Fort Monmouth currently purchases wholesale electric power from General Public Utilities Corporation (GPU) at two delivery points, East Substation located in the south-central portion of the Main Post and at a 34.5 kV metering station located in the Charles Wood Area. The existing electric distribution system consists of:
·	Four 34.5-4.16 kV distribution substations
·	One 12.47-4.16 kV distribution substation
·	Approximately 31.5 circuit miles of primary distribution line
·	1,000 street lights
·	734 building services.

East Substation supplies the main installation via an automatic throw-over switch connecting a bank of two 5000/6250 kVA, 3-phase transformers.  It is supplied from GPU’s 34.5 kV transmission line.  The 34.5 kV line terminates at a GPU owned and maintained substation located adjacent to the East Substation.  The GPU substation consists of one high voltage structure and one-oil circuit breaker located below the Army’s high voltage structure.  A third 5000/6250 kVA 34.5-4.16 kV power transformer with automatic load tap changer was installed in 1997 as a spare to allow one of the other transformers to be taken out of service for maintenance.  This third transformer is connected to the main switchgear via a tie breaker.  The transformer is kept energized, with no load, and could be utilized should a problem occur with the 3 MVA transformer or at the West Substation.
The transformer secondaries, 4160/2400 volts, are connected through a voltage regulator for each bank to a switchgear bus protected by two main circuit breakers equipped with seven breakers and a center tie breaker.  The voltage is then distributed to the Installation via aerial pole lines, except in the more recently constructed areas where a duct and manhole system is used.  The Army owns all the switchgear and distribution feeder lines throughout the Installation.
Most buildings in the Main Post are served at 208/120 volts three phase or 120/240 volts single phase with secondary service drops from pole-mounted transformers.  Larger buildings are served from pad-mounted transformers adjacent to the building or from transformers installed in vaults in the building.
A West Substation was constructed as part of a Corps of Engineers contract to provide power to the 1200 area buildings on the West Side of the Main Post.  This contract was completed in 1990.  This substation is fed from a 34.5 kV aerial transmission line originating from the East Main Post Substation.  The aerial line consists of three #350 MCM Aluminum conductors, fused at 400 amps, which traverse the Main Post to the 1200 area.  The West Substation, as constructed, consisted of a 7500 kVA, 4160/2400-volt load tap changing transformer with oil containment pit and a walk-in metal clad switchgear enclosure.  A 1200 amp protects the transformer primary, 35 kV oil circuit breaker.  There are eight outgoing feeders from the original switchgear.  Some buildings have dual feeder capability.  The distribution system is an underground system, comprised of concrete encased duct banks and manholes.  Splices in the manholes are performed with modular type splices, which offer quick sectionalizing in the event of system failure.
An addition to the West Substation was constructed as a part of a Corps of Engineers contract in 1994.  The addition consisted of another 7500 kVA 4160/2400 volt, load tap changing transformer with oil containment pit and walk-in type metal clad switchgear enclosure.  The transformer primary is protected by a 1200 amp, 35 kV, SF6 breaker.  A tie breaker was installed between the two switchgear sections, to facilitate maintenance to individual transformers and to pick up total load in the event of individual transformer failure.  The tie breaker is normally open during operation of the substation.
There are four outgoing feeders from the additional set of switchgear.  Some buildings have a dual feeder capability through the use of pad mounted sectionalizing switches.  The distribution system is an underground system, utilizing concrete encased duct banks and manholes.  The underground feeder consists of 350 MCM, XLP, 5 kV conductors.  The reuse of the existing duct bank and manhole system on the Avenue of Memories, which is the main avenue traversing the Main Post, enables Fort Monmouth to back feed the East Main Post Substation from the West Substation and vice versa, in the event of substation transformer failure.  The back feed can only accommodate 400 amps of additional load, so energy conservation measures would need to be taken and nonessential load sectionalizing performed in order to avoid overloading the feeders.  Both 7500 kVA transformers in the West Substation have tank mounted fans, which can increase their capacity to 10,500 kVA.
An additional 34.5 kV feeder was installed in 1995 to feed the housing quarters, Research Development and Administration buildings on the East Side of the Main Post.  This feeder also serves to alleviate the East Substation of overloads during the summer peak season.  This new feeder was tapped off the 34.5 kV feeder, supplying power to the West Substation.  The feeder consists of 3 #1/0, 35 kV conductors in a underground duct bank, feeding a 3 MVA 34.5-5 kV pad mounted transformer, with 400 amp, 5 kV pad mounted switchgear.  From the switchgear, a concrete encased underground duct bank carries the feeders to the area along Parkers Creek where the underground feeders switch to an aerial distribution through riser poles.  Primary service to buildings consists of underground primary conductors feeding pad mounted transformers.  Secondary services from the transformers to the buildings are comprised of underground conductors in duct banks.  In case of transformer failure in the 3 MVA Substation, an alternate feed can be provided from the East Substation feeder #4, through aerial switching.
Service to the Charles Wood Area, which is approximately 1 ½ miles west of the Main Post, is by way of an Army owned 34.5 -12.47 kV unit type substation.  The substation is served by a 34.5 kV transmission line, which originates at the 34.5 kV metering station located approximately 1,200 feet south of the substation.
The Charles Wood 34.5 kV metering station consists of 1200 amp, 34.5 kV indoor switchgear consisting of two feeder breakers and one non-automatic source breaker.
The Charles Wood Electrical Distribution system was upgraded from 5 kV to 12.5 kV distribution under a Corps of Engineers contract, completed in 1994.  The contract consisted of installing a 34.5-12.5 kV unit type substation with two 10/11.2/14 MVA 34.5-12.5 kV transformers and 12.5 kV metal enclosed, walk-in type distribution switchgear with vacuum type circuit breakers for the transformer feeders.  Two overhead and two underground 12.5 kV distribution feeders originate from this substation along with two underground 12.5 kV circuits that feed a 12.5-4.16 kV substation located adjacent to Building 2700.
The Building 2700 12.5 kV substation consists of two 7.5 MVA 12.5-5 kV transformers that are oil cooled and have provisions for future air-cooling.  With the present summer peak loading of Building 2700 being approximately 4000 kVA, one of the transformers can handle the load with the other being used as a backup, in the event of transformer failure or in the case transformer maintenance.
The aerial distribution system is fed from two feeders originating at the 12.5 kV Substation and consisting of 3 #2/0 copper conductors with neutral, which feeds office buildings and housing areas.  Service entrances to buildings consist of underground primary conductors, coming off riser poles and feeding pad mounted transformers with underground secondary service entrance conductors.  The Megill and Olmstead Housing areas have been converted to a URD type of electrical distribution system utilizing pad mounted transformers.  The Olmstead Housing area is fed from both feeders with one feeder being normally open through a sectionalizing switch.  In the event of primary feeder failure, the switch can be closed to enable the area to be energized from the alternate feeder.  The Howard Commons Housing area electrical distribution system consists of an aerial distribution system with underground service entrances to buildings.  Service entrances consist of main breaker equipped electrical metering gear with a meter for each quarters.  In case of Fort Monmouth primary feeder failure, the area can be backed by using the utility’s feeder, through aerial switching.

POTABLE WATER SYSTEM
Fort Monmouth currently redistributes the potable water purchased from NJAWC (New Jersey American Water Company) throughout the Main Post and Charles Wood areas via 178,760 linear feet (33.9 miles) of underground potable water distribution lines. Fort Monmouth's potable water system also includes one (1) elevated storage tank and one (1) ground storage tank. The ground storage tank is not service. The potable water distribution system transports potable water from the metered interconnections with NJAWC throughout the Main Post and Charles Wood utility service areas. The potable water mains are constructed primarily of asbestos cement, cast iron, ductile iron or polyvinyl chloride (PVC). There are approximately 253 valves of various sizes and 251 fire hydrants distributed throughout the Main Post and Charles Wood utility service areas.

WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT
Wastewater is collected from the Main Post and Charles Wood utility service areas via 121,360 linear feet (23.0 miles) of underground wastewater collection lines. The Installation's wastewater collection system also includes 547 manholes and nineteen wastewater life stations. The wastewater collected from the two utility service areas then flows to Northeast Monmouth County Regional Sewerage Authority (NEMCRSA) wastewater lift station where it is pumped to the Sewerage Authority's wastewater treatment plant. The majority of the collection system is terra cotta type clay pipe. The wastewater collection system was constructed for the most part from the 1930s to the 1990s.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Center intends to procure, on an other than full and open competitive basis, Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for the UH-60L Integrated Mechanical Di agnostic - Health and Usage Monitoring System (IMD-HUMS) Technology Demonstration Program. It is anticipated that a time and material contract will be awarded.  A noncompetitive acquisition to Simmonds Precision Products, Inc., d/b/a/ Goodrich Fuel & Utili ty Systems, Vergennes, VT is intended pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1).  Goodrich Fuel and Utility Systems is deemed to be the only responsible source.  As the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), the contractor will provide on-site personnel uniquely qualified to support the IMD-HUMS systems while deployed in IRAQ for 14 months.   This support requires access to drawings, interface documentation, source code, and database design specifics in which the Government does not have sufficient rights to allow  competition.  Any delay in providing the maintenance management will degrade the aircraft maintenance capability and negatively affect aircraft readiness and unit survivability.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by this agency.  This acquisition will be conducted using Alpha Contracting techniques;  questions regarding this announcement must be submitted in writing, to the address shown above, data fax (757)-878-0008, or email to mmathieu@aatd.eustis.army.mil.

A statement of work to include information on required configurations, standards for testing and acceptance, room by room breakdowns for access points, and language describing negotiation procedures for parts and labor if additional access points would be necessary. 

There have been many questions regarding CLIN 0010 and CLIN 0011. CLIN 0010 is a no cost ($0.00) software item that comes with CLIN 0006. It will remain as a separate clin, because it must be specified when CLIN 0006 is ordered from CISCO. CLIN 0011 has been verified by CISCO as a good part number.

<DESC>This synopsis is modified to include the Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS) for the MH-53 Helicopter. ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS DESCRIPTION:  The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract on a sole source basis to EDO Marine and Aircraft Systems,  North Amityville, New York 11701-4840.   This IDIQ contract includes a variety of engineering services for the repair and conversion of the MK 105, Organic Airborne and Surface Influence Sweep (OASIS), and the Precise Navigation System (PNS).  The use of task orders will provide the flexibility necessary for the different types of work required.  Under this IDIQ EDO will provide for repair, modification and overhaul of the MK 105, OASIS and PNS systems.  This includes all depot repairs and incorporation of Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), including the generation of all Integrated Logistics Support documentation to support the conversions.  This effort is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. a)	EDO is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and the only source for the three systems listed above.  As such, only EDO has the expertise, technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel to successfully complete the system overhauls and supporting documentation as well as the other tasking specified above. EDO has been the sole developer of the OASIS system including the award of the Systems Design and Development (SD&D) Contract (Contract No. N00024-02-C-6316 in fiscal year 2002.  There have been no other contractual actions related to the direct development of the OASIS system since award of this contract.  The Government does not own the fully validated technical data package (TDP) and will not own the TDP until the end of contract N00024-02-C-6316, which is scheduled for completion in fiscal year 2006.    EDO is the Depot facility for the above Airborne Mine Counter Measures (AMCM) systems.  By PMS-495 direction, EDO is the Software Support Activity and the D! rawing Configuration Manager for the MK 105, OASIS, and Precise Navigation systems. The Government views all software and drawing changes, but the software and drawings reside at EDO under Contractor control. b)	Given the complexity of the MK-105, OASIS, and PNS systems and the level of system knowledge required to overhaul and repair this complex equipment and systems, EDO is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering and design services to accomplish all tasking. c)	This is a follow-on contract for the acquisition of engineering services for continued development of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. In summary, there are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.  Note 22 applies.

<CONTACT>Dora Hill, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 757-7512, Fax 301-757-7054, Email dora.hill@navy.mil
<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request For Information (RFI) for planning purposes.     This is NOT a Request for Proposal.   NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  The intent of this  RFI is to assist the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in conducting market research of industry to identify innovative approaches to providing a broad based support package that is efficient and embraces continuous process and product improvement to optimize the life cycle support provided to the Navy/Marine Corps forces operating ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System (TJS), worldwide.  To provide a more cost-effective readiness solution for the entire ALQ-99 TJS, Performance Based Logistics (PBL) support is being considered for the entire inventory and peculiar support/test equipment.  PBL support of the ALQ-99 Pod includes, but not limited to, maintenance planning and analysis, supply support, configuration management, and obsolescence management.  A draft Statement of Work is available on the website located at https://c802tdc4.crane.navy.mil/pod/pod.htm.  To get access to this website, you will need to register at http://www.crane.navy.mil/tdc.  When registering, use Kim Horn as the Government POC and ALQ-99 TJS POD PBL as the justification for access.  
As delineated in Title 10 USC Sec. 2464, ALQ-99 TJS depot maintenance must be performed at a Government owned and operated facility, by Government personnel.     For depot level maintenance, public/private partnership is the required approach to meet Title 10 USC core logistics capability requirements.    
Industry Days will be held at Crane, IN on 13-14 July 2005 from 1000 – 1800.  The purpose of Industry Days is to discuss ALQ-99 TJS product support  by providing an overview, tours, and question and answer session in the form of a public forum.    The point of Contact for visit requests or travel information is Kim Horn, kimberly.horn@navy.mil.  Request interested parties submit  their intent to attend Industry Days and and submit visit request by  11 July 2005.  Questions regarding PBL may be submitted in writing to Dora Hill at dora.hill@navy.mil or Trudy Carroll at trudy.carroll@navy.mil.   Questions submitted prior to 11 July 2005 may be addressed during Industry Days, however, all questions and answers will be posted on the website, https://c802tdc4.crane.navy.mil/pod/pod.htm .  
The AN/ALQ-99 TJS is the first fully integrated, computer controlled, support jamming system. The AN/ALQ-99 intercepts and automatically processes electromagnetic signals and power manages the system's transmitters to effectively jam large numbers of diverse threats with very high effective radiated power. Since its deployment in the early 1970's aboard US Marine Corps and US Navy carrier-based EA-6B Prowler aircraft, this system has undergone multiple upgrades. The EA-6B/ALQ-99 combination has become an indispensable fleet asset, fully integrated into all air wing combat missions.
The ALQ-99 is comprised of an On Board System (OBS) and a Tactical Jamming System (TJS). The OBS includes the receiver, processor, and aircrew interfaces and is used to collect tactical electronic order of battle (EOB) data which can be disseminated through the command and control system while airborne, and which can be recorded and processed after missions to provide updates to various orders of battle. The TJS includes a selection of mission-configured jammer pods carried as external stores. The modular open architecture of the TJS facilitates optimizing transmitters and antennas for a given frequency range, as well as tailored mission configurations. 
	Each jammer pod contains a ram air turbine generator, two selectable transmitter modules with associated antennas, and a universal exciter that is interfaced with and controlled by the onboard system and aircrew. The scope of the PBL includes the 2,500 weapon replaceable assemblies (WRAs) comprising the TJS portion of the ALQ-99 system only. 

DISCLAIMER:  This RFI is issued solely for information and analytical purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  There is no solicitation in process at this time.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Per FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Availability of any formal solicitation will be announced under a separate Federal Business Opportunities (Fedbizops) announcement.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  SUBMISSION OF RESPONSES AND CONTACT INFORMATION:  The Navy plans to use the Internet and e-mail as the primary means of disseminating and exchanging information.  All interested parties shall submit their questions/comments/additional data requests by 1 August 2005.  
Responses to this RFI should include: 1) A Rough Order of Magnitude estimate of vendor non-recurring and recurring costs  2) A description of process changes; 3) A plan of action and timeframe for operational capability ; 4) Any other information at vendor discretion.  A brief company profile/history may be  provided as a separate attachment.

<RESPDATE>072904
<CONTACT>Benita Jackson, Contract Specialist, Phone 703 767-9407, Fax 703 767-2382, Email benita.jackson@dla.mil
<DESC>DESC: The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army plans to offer the privatization of the electric and natural gas utility systems located at the Fort McPherson and Fort Gillem, Georgia.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, firms(s) will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm(s) will be required to purchase the existing systems from the Government and may be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the Government.  The resulting contract(s), if awarded, will require the Contractor(s) to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s).  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor(s) shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an Easement (an example will be attached to the RFP).  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The Contractor(s) proposals and plans may become a part of the contract upon the decision to award.  Past Performance information from potential Offeror's shall be submitted as directed in the RFP.  No Offeror will be denied the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.  The utility systems being privatized are described as follows:  
FORT MCPHERSON:
Fort McPherson is located in the city of Atlanta, four miles southwest of downtown. It covers 487 acres of well-landscaped grounds. Fort McPherson operates a sub-post, Fort Gillem, which is a 1,500-acre site located 10 miles southeast of Atlanta.  Electrical Distribution System:  Fort McPherson currently purchases electric power at 12.5 kV from Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) at a single primary delivery point. Two Georgia Power 34.5 kV transmission circuits, one overhead construction and one underground supply the central commercial area.  Fort McPherson owns and operates an electrical distribution system consisting of: one 12.5 kV distribution substation; approximately 4.3 circuit miles of overhead primary distribution line; and approximately 2.8 circuit miles of underground primary distribution line.  The main substation, which supplies the entire Installation, consists of two incoming 34.5 kV transmission line bays, two 7.5 MVA 34.5 – 12.5 kV transformers, three 333 kVA voltage regulators, and five 12.5 kV feeder vacuum circuit breakers. Georgia Power owns the 34.5 kV switching and protective equipment, and the two power transformers. Fort McPherson owns the 12.5 kV vacuum circuit breakers.  The primary distribution system consists of five 12.5 kV circuits. The distribution system is composed primarily of overhead, pole-line construction (which is conventional, open wire construction) with pole-mounted transformer banks. In addition, there is also a small amount of underground primary construction, utilizing both direct burial and duct type construction practices.
Natural Gas Distribution System:
Fort McPherson purchases its natural gas requirements from Atlanta Gas Light Company (“AGL”), under interruptible gas Schedule I-21 Commercial Rate.  A Propane Air Plant located at Fort McPherson was constructed, and is owned and operated by a contractor, Systems Corp.  The natural gas or the propane air mixture (during natural gas interruption) is distributed throughout the Installation through a distribution system with pipes ranging in size from less than two inches to six inches in diameter.  The total length of the system is 50,500 linear feet, serving about 103 buildings.  The system was originally installed in the 1950s; however, some of the system was installed as late as 1986 and 1996. PLEASE NOTE:  Fort McPherson will require all future renewals/replacements/upgrades of overhead lines, pole mounted transformers and all overhead facilities to be replaced with underground line, pad mounted transformers, and underground facilities. 

FORT GILLEM:
Fort Gillem is a sub-post of Fort McPherson. Fort McPherson is located in the city of Atlanta, four miles southwest of downtown. It covers 487 acres of well-landscaped grounds. Fort Gillem is a 1,500-acre site located in Forest Park, 10 miles southeast of Atlanta. Fort Gillem is home for the 1st U.S. Army and the U.S. Army Southeast Region Recruiting Command.  Electrical Distribution System Description:  Fort Gillem currently purchases electrical power at 12.5 kV from Georgia Power at a single primary delivery point near the north boundary of the Installation. Fort Gillem owns and operates an electrical distribution system consisting of: one 12.5 kV distribution substation; approximately 17.1 circuit miles of overhead primary distribution line; and approximately 1.0 circuit mile of underground primary distribution line.  The main substation, which supplies the entire compound, is a conventional, outdoor, air-insulated substation consisting of two incoming 115 kV transmission line bays, one 20 MVA 115 – 12.5 kV power transformer, and a 12.5 kV secondary structure. The secondary structure is configured with a main oil-filled circuit breaker, a main and transfer bus, voltage regulators, and four feeder oil-filled circuit breakers. Georgia Power owns the 115 kV switching and protective equipment, and the power transformer. Fort Gillem owns the 12.5 kV structure, buswork, voltage regulators, and oil-filled circuit breakers. This substation provides voltage regulation, control, and over-current protection for four 12.5 kV overhead feeders.  The majority of the distribution circuits are configured with loop tie switches to neighboring circuits. The distribution system is composed primarily of overhead, pole-line construction (which is narrow-profile, open wire construction) with pole-mounted transformer banks. There is also a small amount of underground primary construction (utilizing duct type construction practices and pad-mounted transformers). The major underground primary facilities are arranged in a looped configuration.  Natural Gas Distribution System: Fort Gillem purchases its natural gas requirements from Atlanta Gas Light Company (AGL), under interruptible gas schedule I-21 Commercial Rate.  There is a Propane Air Plant at Fort Gillem that is owned and operated by a contractor, Systems Corp.  The natural gas or the propane air mixture (during natural gas interruption) is distributed throughout the installation through a distribution system with pipes ranging in size from less than two inches to six inches in diameter.  The total length of the system is 63,030 linear feet, serving about 119 buildings.  The present gas system was installed in 1996.  PLEASE NOTE:  Fort Gillem will require all future renewals / replacements / upgrades of overhead lines, pole mounted transformers and all overhead facilities to be replaced with underground line, pad mounted transformers, and underground facilities.

<CONTACT>Linda L. Zamarocy, 312-846-5374
<DESC>By way of this notice, and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the Chicago District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announces its intention to award a sole source contract to National Audubon Society (NAS)/Chicago Region for planning recommendations for th e restoration of grassland bird habitat at the Orland Tract of the Forest Preserve District of Cook County.   The work consists of the preparation of plant community maps and maps of the 2005 nesting locations of grassland birds, the description of 2 alternative plans and the identification of a preferred plan that includes a recommended species lists for planting , development of alternatives, an invasive species removal plan, and mapping. NAS/Chicago Region is uniquely qualified to prepare a vegetation/grassland bird restoration plan for the site.  No private sector organizations have attempted this type of project in the region.  NAS/Chicago Region recently completed the planning and imple mentation of a revegetation project at a nearby mile-square site, Bartel Grasslands, which supports many of the above species.  Numbers of nesting grassland birds increased notably since the project.  At Spring Creek Valley Forest Preserve a NAS/Chicago Re gion project is underway and a number of rare species have already returned.  The director of the organization designed and supervised the successful 1,000-acre vegetation and grassland bird restoration at Nachusa Grassland in his earlier position as Scien ce Director at The Nature Conservancy/Illinois.   They are the only group available that has knowledge and experience in the combination of the restoration of native vegetation to sites in the Chicago region with the restoration of habitat for these very s ensitive, legally protected, bird species.  Orland Tract has Land & Water Reserve Status under the Illinois Nature Preserves Commission, which offers stringent legal protection.  There is also considerable interest in the site and any restoration activitie s from concerned and active stakeholders that include birders, site volunteers, and the City of Orland.  Work there, including surveys and mapping, must receive a permit from the forest Preserve District of cook County as the owners and managers of the sit e.  National Audubon Society/Chicago Region has been granted the requisite permits because of field investigations performed on the site over the last 3 years.  Earlier efforts by governmental agencies to restore habitat for these species have had limited success.  It is thought that incorrect vegetation structure may have been the cause.  For these reasons NAS is the one responsible source who can satisfy our agencies requirements. The performance period is for approximately 18 months.  It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be a firm-fixed priced Purchase Order.  This notice is NOT a Request for Quotations; therefore NO solicitation documents will be issued.  Award is an ticipated on or about July 15, 2005. The Point of contact for this contractual action is Linda Zamarocy, Contract Specialist at Telephone Number (312) 846-5374 or Fax Number (312) 886-5475. **This modification is to change the Response Date from 07-14-2005 to 07-20-2005**

Questions were received during one on one interview  sessions June 15, 2005.  ********************************************************************* Update:  Second set of answers to questions and Industry Day POCs - 24 June 2005 Questions were received prior to Industry Day regarding CMMI and current  contractors working in SIMAF.  A request was also received for contact  information of companies participating in Industry Days.  Both have been added  to the library (scroll below). We are working on questions received during Industry Day and anticipate posting  answers by 6 July 2005. *************************************************************   Update: Upload of Industry Day Files - 15 Jun 05 Files briefed at the 14 Jun 05 Industry Day have been uploaded to the PIXS  library.  ********************************************************* Update: Extension of SOC Submittal Date + Industry Day briefings - 14 Jun 05 During the Industry Day held today, it was determined that the submittal of  the Statement of Capability (SOC), originally due on Friday June 17th will be  extended to 1600 (EST) Wed June 22nd. Several Questions were asked about the  SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following infromation is provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple Functions QUESTION:  Because the standard business practices, company past performance and  responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR requirements/restrictions will be the same  for all functional areas, would it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a  cover letter with separate attachments; one containing the common company data  and then attachments that address each functional area separately?  ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions  being proposed may be grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a  package. Common or repeated information may be referred to from another  function area SOC, however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will be acceptable, however.  Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one page cover page that may  contain business information and details like business size and CAGE code,  etc. The cover page does not count towards the 5 pages per function.  Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be acceptable to submit the SOC via email?  ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is acceptable. Please  allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC  submittals  to Patricia Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil. The PCO  will confirm receipt of the SOC. Availability of Industry Day Briefings QUESTION: Will the 14 June 05 XR-SIMAF Industry Day briefings be made available to  industry via PIXS, or via a CD and when? ANSWER: The 14 June Industry Day briefings will be loaded to PIXS and will  available for download by COB 15 Jun 05. ****************************************************************************** Update:  Posting of Improved Labor-Hour Estimate -- 7 June 2005 The following sentences have been modified in the following synopsis to  reflect an improved estimate of labor hours for this effort: FROM...

Constructive simulation, virtual simulation, and capabilities analyses support  services are sought for the Simulation and Analysis Facility (SIMAF) and  ASC/XR. The ASC/XR Mission is effects-based planning to maximize efficiency in  delivering war-winning capability. XR provides planning interfaces across the  aeronautical enterprise and to MAJCOM and HQ AFMC processes. Collaborative  modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS+A) is seen as a key enabler of  capabilities analyses and integration as well as system-of-systems (SoS)  concepts for future capabilities.  The SIMAF is a secure facility capable of operating through the full range of  security classifications.  Contractor personnel will be required to have the  appropriate level of clearance to meet day-to-day operational requirements.   The scope of simulation efforts within the SIMAF spans weapons systems  acquisition life cycles, from conceptual to developmental phases through  sustainment, and may be executed in segregated or integrated air-to-air, air- to-ground, and surface-to-air environments as specified by the government.   Typical requirements are constructive simulation studies, virtual simulation  studies, human system integration studies, distributed simulation events, and  support for simulation events that may include live testing or direct test.   Five support functions structured as Performance Based Services are  anticipated for FY06 thru FY10. Firms may propose one (except for E below  which must be proposed in concert with at least one other area), two, three,  four or all functions (approximate functional percentage of total effort is  shown as percentage): A)	Capabilities Development and Integration (software development) (30%)  Typical areas of software development include, but are not limited to  simulation specific code, weapons SoS network architectures, interfaces and  protocols; computer system network architectures, interfaces and protocols;  and data analysis software.  For more detail see Functional Area appendix in  PIXS Library. B)	Event Planning, Development and Execution (15%),  Includes support simulation event planning, development, and execution  activities which include, but are not limited to: coordination and/or  assistance with software, database, and scenario development activities,  analysis activities, and simulation hardware support activities. For more  detail see Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. C)	Simulation Analysis (20%) Typical analysis activities associated with constructive simulation studies,  virtual simulation studies, distributed simulation events, and support for  simulation events that may include live testing or direct tests.  Analyses  areas of interest include, but are not limited to survivability, lethality,  mission effectiveness, interoperability assessments, systems of systems  architecture, and human system integration. For more detail see Functional  Area appendix in PIXS Library. D)	Facility and Simulation Hardware Support (30% includes 15% Material  Purchases) The Simulation and Analysis Facility is a secure classified facility, which  will require the following Facility support functions: Operational Support;  Hardware Buildup; Facility Preparation; Hardware/Operator Interface (See the  Functional Area appendix in the PIXS library). The Government will require the contractor(s) to provide support for the SIMAF  Road-shows including equipment procurement, shipping, set-up, show support,  and teardown. SIMAF will require various commercially available software and  hardware to be purchased to sustain its daily facility and simulation  operation. The Material to be procured will include: Computer Hardware,  Cockpit Hardware, Simulation Systems, Visual and Graphic Display Systems,  Computer Networking Equipment, Communications Systems. For more detail see  Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. E)	Enterprise Capabilities Integration Process Support (5%) ASC/XR strives to leverage MS+A techniques across aeronautical enterprise  processes.  Both General Support and specific Project Support efforts are  anticipated under this functional area. General Enterprise support consists  of  participating in Integrated Analysis Team meetings, the Aeronautical  Enterprise (AE) IPT, ASC/XR Capabilities Integration Board (CIB) meetings,   the Aeronautical Enterprise Steering Group (AESG), analytical planning support  to I-CRRA Action Items or Objectives, Cost Estimating capabilities toolsets,  architecture product (e.g. OV-1) validation, participation with OEMs thru  Wright Brothers Institute (WBI), etc. Project specific efforts likely to be  tasked thru task order might include participating in project System  Engineering Working Group (SEWG) and other MS+A related project working group  meetings,  assisting in development of project specific analysis plans to  include the appropriate mix of constructive, virtual, and hardware in the loop  simulations, etc. , assisting in development of program management plans, test  plans, etc, for project specific requirements,  working with specific projects  in developing Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) support plans,  assisting in  planning and executing assessments of competing conceptual approaches for a  specific project such as support to a government source selection. The acquisition strategy currently contemplates a 60-month effort with a three- year CORE effort incrementally funded and two one-year options and Customer  Event Task Orders.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements Time and Materials  (T+M) type contract is contemplated.    The estimated level of effort for this contract is approximately 78,000 labor  hours for the first year, increasing by 10 percent per year thereafter for a  total three year CORE effort of approximately 258,000 labor hours. The two  option years have an estimated 90,000 labor hours each. Customer events will  be supported using task orders.  Collaborative analysis involves significant challenges in protection of  intellectual property and classified information. Associate contractor  Agreement clauses will be utilized in each functional area contract that XR  awards. An Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) clause 5352.209-9002 is  anticipated to be necessary to emphasize the restrictions that will be levied  upon recipients due to the need to protect Proprietary Information and  Intellectual Property of other contractors. Individual employees  will be required to execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).   A Top Secret facility/personnel security level will be required.  Top Secret  clearances will be required for 50% of the staff at time of contract award.   All personnel must be capable of receiving a Top Secret clearance, although  they are not expected to be necessary for everyone at this time.  All  personnel will be required to hold a Secret clearance.  Foreign firms should  be aware that restrictions apply which could preclude their receipt of any  resulting contract.  ITAR restrictions apply in performance of these  contracts.  To determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award,  foreign-owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or  technical point of contact before submitting an SOC.  Submit only unclassified  information for consideration and evaluation.  Statements of Capabilities (SOC) Organizations having capabilities in military operations research Modeling,  Simulation and Analysis (MS+A), computer simulation requirements definition,  exercise and test planning and implementation in a simulated environment, and  scenario generation for large scale distributed simulations are invited to  submit a SOC by 17 Jun 2005 for consideration. Firms having the capability to  perform one or more functions A – D (or E with one of the above) are invited  to submit a statement of capability (SOC) in order for the Government to  determine the appropriate small businesses strategy.  Based on the results of  the SOC evaluation, the Government reserves the right to set aside one or more  functions of this requirement for small businesses or to develop innovative  small business goals or arrangements.  Offerors shall indicate whether they  are/are not a small business, a small disadvantaged business, 8(a), hub-zone  certified, woman-owned, service disabled veteran owned, veteran owned, or  Historically Black College/University and against which function(s) they are  submitting their SOC, and if your interest is as a prime contractor or as a  subcontractor.     The SOC shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing the  offerors capabilities to perform in the specified five critical support  functions.  For each functional area (and the associated addendum) to which  you plan to respond, please answer the following questions.   1.

 C - Description/Specifications/Work Statement


The National Institutes of Health consist of 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs) whose mission is to fund and conduct biomedical research. A cluster of these ICs are primarily interested in biomedical research involving the neurosciences. These ICs share a common need for research, development and research support services in order to support their neuroscience research mission.
The objective of this contract is to help provide the additional staffing necessary to help these ICs
fulfill their mission.

The ICs that this contract is designed to support are The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the
NIH Clinical Center (CC).

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) supports and conducts biomedical and behavioral research on the causes, consequences, treatment, and prevention of alcoholism and alcohol-related problems. NIAAA also provides leadership in the national effort to reduce the severe and often fatal consequences of these problems by: 
•	Conducting and supporting research directed at determining the causes of alcoholism, discovering how alcohol damages the organs of the body, and developing prevention and treatment strategies for application in the Nation's health care system; 
•	Supporting and conducting research across a wide range of scientific areas including genetics, neuroscience, medical consequences, medication development, prevention, and treatment through the award of grants and within the NIAAA's intramural research program; 
•	Conducting policy studies that have broad implications for alcohol problem prevention, treatment and rehabilitation activities; 
•	Conducting epidemiological studies such as national and community surveys to assess risks for and magnitude of alcohol-related problems among various population groups; 
•	Collaborating with other research institutes and Federal programs relevant to alcohol abuse and alcoholism, and providing coordination for Federal alcohol abuse and alcoholism research activities; 
•	Maintaining continuing relationships with institutions and professional associations; with international, national, state and local officials; and voluntary agencies and organizations engaged in alcohol-related work; and 
•	Disseminating research findings to health care providers, researchers, policymakers, and the public. 


National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is the nation's leading supporter of biomedical research on disorders of the brain and nervous system. NINDS needs to provide research services to support research at the NMR center.

<DESC>The Office of Inspector general is considering contracting for an audit of the Railroad Retirement Board’s (RRB)’s statement of social insurance in conjunction with its audit of the agency’s fiscal year (FY) 2006 financial statements. 

Please provide a cost estimate that includes an estimated fixed price, staffing levels and staff hours, and timeframes for a planned audit of the statement of social insurance.  Send information no later than July 29, 2005, to:

Henrietta B. Shaw
Assistant Inspector General, Audit
Office of Inspector General
844 N. Rush Street
Chicago, Illinois 60611
312/751-4509
Hshaw@oig.rrb.gov

A detailed description of the proposed audit engagement follows.


Introduction

The Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to obtain input from qualified firms interested in conducting an audit of the statement of social insurance for the Railroad Retirement program.

The statement of social insurance will be subject to audit as a basic financial statement effective with fiscal year (FY) 2006 financial reporting.  The statement of social insurance was previously classified as Required Supplementary Stewardship Information and has not previously been audited.

The OIG plans to rely on the report of a qualified contractor in forming its opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole.

Background

The RRB is an independent agency in the executive branch of the Federal government.  Its primary function is to administer comprehensive retirement-survivor and unemployment-sickness insurance benefit programs for the nation's railroad workers and their families.  These programs are provided under the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA).  In addition, the RRB has administrative responsibilities under the Social Security Act for certain benefit payments and Medicare coverage for railroad workers.
Financial Reporting

The RRB publishes audited financial statements in its annual Performance and Accountability Report, the form and content of which is mandated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

The agency prepares its annual financial statements from the books and records of the RRB in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) has recognized the statements of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) promulgated by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) as GAAP for Federal government entities.

During FY 2004, the Railroad Retirement program paid over $9 billion in benefits and reported approximately $30 billion in assets at fiscal year-end.  The RRB's financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30,2004 reported total financing sources of $9,553,838,826 which it received primarily from the financial interchange with the Social Security Administration and payroll taxes.  The bulk of the RRB's financing sources are expended on benefits for railroad workers. 

The agency’s FY 2004 financial statements reported total assets of $5,170,244,747 which were comprised primarily of investments with the Treasury and receivables from the Social Security Administration for the financial interchange.  The balance of the Railroad Retirement program’s assets, approximately $24 billion, were held and invested by the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT).  The NRRIT prepares and publishes financial reports separate from the RRB.


Statement of Social Insurance

The RRB currently presents a statement of social insurance and other information as required supplementary stewardship information (RSSI).  Effective with the financial reporting for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the information required by paragraphs 27(3) and 32(3) of SFFAS #17 will be presented as a basic financial statement rather than RSSI.  The underlying significant assumptions will be included in notes that are presented as an integral part of the basic financial statement.

Other information required by SFFAS #17, including the sensitivity analysis required in SFFAS #17, paragraphs 27(4) and 32(4), will be presented as required supplementary information (RSI), except to the extent that the preparer elects to include some or all of that information in the notes that are presented as an integral part of the statement of social insurance.

The statement of social insurance, related notes and disclosures are prepared by the RRB’s Bureau of the Actuary at RRB Headquarters, 844 N. Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois.

Deliverables

The audit engagement will require the successful offeror to:

1.	develop a staffing plan demonstrating the professional qualifications of the engagement staff;

2.	develop a work plan detailing the methodology and timeframes of the engagement including identification of applicable guidance and the manner in which requirements will be met;

3.	perform all work necessary to form an opinion on the statement of social insurance;

4.	provide a written report communicating the opinion of the firm and any other audit findings pursuant to applicable reporting requirements.

The OIG will require access to and, in its sole discretion, copies of any working papers created in performance of this engagement.


Applicable Guidance

The audit of the RRB’s statement of social insurance will be conducted in accordance with standards promulgated by the AICPA, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and OMB.

On November 22, 2004, the AICPA issued Statement of Position 04-1, “Auditing the Statement of Social Insurance” communicating the recommendations of the AICPA’s Social Insurance Task Force regarding the application of Statements on Auditing Standards to audits of statements of social insurance.


Professional Qualifications

Offerors must be certified or licensed for the practice of public accountancy by a regulatory authority of a state or other political subdivision of the United States and must be a member in good standing with the applicable State Board(s) of Accountancy.


Professional Experience

Offerors will be expected to demonstrate that their firm and staff assigned to the engagement have the following types of experience.

a.	Experience in performing financial statement audits of federal agencies.

b.	Experience in auditing entities subject to the requirements of the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 and the implementation guidance issued by OMB.

c.	Experience in performing audits of pension funds.

d.	Experience in providing actuarial services to governmental units.

e.	Experience in providing management consulting services to governmental units.
Additional Information 

Interested parties may obtain more information about the RRB from its public website U.S. Railroad Retirement Board Home Page.  The available information includes descriptions of the agency’s organization, programs as well as financial reports prepared by the agency’s Bureau of Fiscal Operations and statistical and actuarial reports prepared by its Bureau of the Actuary.

<CONTACT>Donnie O'Brien, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 443-3486, Fax (301) 443-5462, Email do'brien@hrsa.gov
<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is conducting a sources sought synopsis for market research to locate organizations that are capable of providing development, maintenance and support services to the Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) and its grantees for the registry software and reporting systems used by and for the health centers. The BPHC seeks to assure that users properly apply and implement the integrated software system consistent with program objectives including health centers performance measures and indices for primary health care clinical outcome measures.

Health Disparities Collaborative (HDC) is a program to improve (through widespread system change) the health care delivery system in Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) funded consolidated health centers.  The purpose of this initiative is to improve the care delivered to the underserved, improve the efficiency and management of the health centers and eliminate health disparities.  The HDC represents a strategy that: (1) addresses senior leadership; (2) implements a care, improvement and learning model to change practice; (3) supports an infrastructure to sustain improvement, and (4) develops key partnerships at the local and national level. The long term objectives of the BPHC HDC program are 1) to provide health centers with the much needed support and capability to capture and report clinical and operational data and 2) to use these data to make internal improvements within health center operations to improve patient health outcomes.  

While health centers are improving patient care and related outcomes through knowledge and practices gained through their participation in the HRSA Health Disparities Collaboratives (HDC), HRSA is achieving the national performance goals for health disparities, which are critical in meeting the requirements of the Government Efficiency and Performance Reform Act.  These performance goals are accountability measures for which the BPHC must report to the President and Congress as part of budget submissions and updates.  As a result, BPHC supported grantees are accountable for performance in reducing or eliminating health disparities in the Nation.  

In meeting the president’s initiative to properly report on the 16 million patients, the HRSA HDC will integrate into a Primary Health Care Collaborative encompassing an integration of the following four types of collaboratives: 1) disease specific, 2) general prevention and cancer screening, 3) access and redesign of health center operations to include patient flow and finance, and 4) community systems pilots. 

The purpose of this notice is to seek sources with capabilities and in-depth expertise in designing, developing, and managing the implementation of a national registry system capable of interoperability with existing systems being used by the HRSA-supported health centers and other HRSA-grantees working in primary health care. 

Interested organizations may include in their capability statements commercial off the shelf software, as long as it is able to demonstrate and provide management and functionality capabilities, and technical specifications as stated below. 

Management Capabilities include: interoperability of health management systems and data; ability to revamp systems in progress; ability and experience in programming code and its functionality; demonstrated appropriate expertise for both virtual and local technical support; and ability to provide training, technical assistance and support effectively and efficiently to HRSA’s customers, including grantees.

Functional Capabilities include: integrated reports for Primary Health Care Collaboratives; scalable system designed to track population based care for more than 16 million patients; ensures portability of information with ability to transfer current data to the new system and to produce aggregated reporting of data at the local, state, and national level; maintains HIPAA compliance security for data in accordance with federal law; provides unfettered government access; remains consistent with developing industry standards; ability to fix and add reports, and to support web site.

Technical Specifications include: development and implementation of reporting indices of measures, clinical encounter documentation, results retrieval, clinical decision support, clinical order entry with unfettered access for the federal government; development and implementation of interfaces that allow seamless transfer of data and assure ease of use by health centers; ability for current and additional data dictionary components to be captured, refined, and recalculated including collection of patient demographic, financial including billing, pharmaceutical and laboratory components; assure program security, 508 compliance, and complete a system security plan.

Documentation may include Government and commercial contracts, providing references (with names, telephone numbers, and email addresses) and any other information serving to document the organizations capability.

Your submission must be received in this office by 3:00 PM on July 19, 2005 by post office mail, email, or fax to the following address: HHS/HRSA/OAFM/DPM; Attn: Donnie O’Brien; 560  Fishers Lane, Room 13A-19; Rockville, MD 20857; telephone number (301) 443-3486; fax number (301) 443-5462; do’brien@hrsa.gov.  The capability statements shall not be more than twenty-five (25) pages on 8.5” x 11” with 1” margins and a 12-point font size.

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED TO AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  RESPONSES SHALL NOT INCLUDE COST OR PRICING INFORMATION.

<DESC>NASA is considering adopting policies and developing plans and procedures to expand access to and use of the Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) at John F. Kennedy Space Center by other government agencies and their contractors, university research and technology programs, and commercial users as outlined in this request.   The KSC Center Operations Directorate (TA) is soliciting expressions of interest by prospective users of the SLF subject to the limitations and conditions described in this RFI. Information is being sought to allow NASA to formulate appropriate policy, plans, and procedures to enable expanded use of the SLF consistent with Federal Law, Regulations, National Space Policy, and NASA’s programmatic requirements both current and future. In accordance with the U.S. Space Transportation Policy and the NASA Real Property Management Plan, and consistent with the President’s Management Agenda, KSC is seeking to accommodate conditional access to the SLF by users from all sectors under appropriate reimbursable agreements. It is emphasized that NASA use of the SLF for support of the Space Shuttle Program and other agency activities shall take precedence over any and all other prospective uses throughout the remaining operational life of the Space Shuttle Program and beyond. It is anticipated that the requirement for Space Shuttle Orbiter landings, and related mission support, on the SLF will not extend beyond 2010. However, agency requirements for other aircraft operations, spacecraft and flight vehicle operations, and related support activities will extend into the foreseeable future as the nation’s new exploration vision is pursued and NASA carries out mission objectives. To the extent consistent with NASA’s priorities, KSC is investigating the potential to support the following types of uses for the SLF: 1.	Research and technology demonstration flights of piloted and unpiloted aircraft and spaceflight vehicles conducted by other NASA organizations, other government agencies, their contractors, universities, and commercial manufacturers or operators. 2.	Parabolic research and demonstration flights supporting microgravity experiments and microgravity flights serving as a precursor to commercial human space flight. 3.	Commercial space flight research, technology demonstration, and logistical support, including but not limited to delivery of commercial spacecraft and flight hardware, captive test flights, and aircraft-based deployment of piloted and unpiloted suborbital and orbital launchers and spacecraft. 4.	Other research and technology demonstrations or experiments that can benefit from the characteristics of the SLF and KSC. 5.	Use by current or future international partners of NASA to the extent consistent with agency agreements and ITAR/Export Control regulations. 6.	Other uses not listed here and not excluded below. The following types of uses are not deemed appropriate for access to the SLF at this time and will not be considered: 1.	Corporate aircraft flights or conventional commercial passenger aircraft charter flights. 2.	General aviation uses. 3.	Ordnance testing. 4.	Any non-NASA use that would have the effect of precluding reasonable access by commercial users for the types of activities outlined above. 5.	Any use not identified as a candidate use above which cannot demonstrate a need for the unique capabilities and characteristics of the SLF, or the associated technical support services of NASA and/or the Air Force Eastern Test Range. Other factors prospective users may wish to consider and comment on in their response to this RFI are as follow: Facility Description: The SLF is a single, 15,000-foot concrete runway located in Complex 39 at the Kennedy Space Center. It is oriented to the southeast and northwest with runways designated as 15 and 33 on the approach compass. Air traffic control is managed by a Military Radar Unit (MRU) from a newly-constructed control tower built to FAA standards. The SLF airspace is part of the national airspace system and is in restricted airspace. The runway at present has limited apron area and no on-site aviation fuel storage or maintenance. Fire/crash/rescue is not located on-site at the SLF but could be made available as part of a use agreement with KSC. The Florida Space Authority (FSA) owns a hangar facility off the SLF tow way. Built to support reusable launch vehicle programs, the FSA hangar can be made available to SLF users through arrangements made with the FSA. The FSA hangar does not currently meet code for storage of fueled aircraft, and would require upgraded systems to accommodate users requesting hangar storage of their fueled aircraft. A Fact Sheet describing the SLF and its current capabilities and operations is available from the NASA point of contact. NASA may be willing to consider improvements provided at the user’s expense. Pricing: NASA has not determined pricing for cost recovery, including appropriate charges to apply to SLF operations and maintenance services. It is anticipated that a fixed reimbursement fee to be based on a formula to be determined will be charged, along with the costs of optional services that may be requested or required. Optional services may include, but not be limited to, safety and risk assessments for other than piloted aircraft of known and reliable performance characteristics; specialized technical support such as instrumentation and telemetry; access to KSC research and processing labs and/or technical capabilities; use of KSC and U.S. Air Force range services. Support services, such as aviation fueling, must be obtained by non-Federal SLF users through commercial arrangements. Management Approach: An air space management plan will be developed by NASA in cooperation with the Federal Aviation Authority and the Air Force Eastern Test Range based upon the nature of prospective uses identified in response to this RFI. It is NASA’s intent to provide an operating environment for aircraft of known and reliable performance characteristics, flying well defined missions within prescribed parameters, that is similar to that of any airfield under FAA airspace management. Unpiloted aircraft, experimental aircraft, and aircraft engaged in space launch or space vehicle testing and evaluation will be subject to safety and operational restrictions intended to protect the nation’s assets at KSC and the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, the workforce at these facilities, and the public in neighboring communities. Security Considerations: Based on responses to this RFI, NASA will perform a preliminary security evaluation to determine if the proposed use poses a manageble risk to national assets, KSC personnel, and federal security policy.   Unacceptable risks must be mitigated or the use cannot be approved. The SLF remains inside the KSC security zone and existing security procedures will remain in effect. Users will be required to obtain proper NASA access credentials for their employees and any passengers using the procedures and controls established by NASA/KSC Security. Specialized security requirements needed by Federal agencies or their contractors are available as an optional service. Foreign-origin flights using the SLF will require Customs and security measures as deemed necessary. Space Shuttle Program Restrictions: SLF use will be conditioned on non-interference with the Shuttle launch activity.  Shuttle mission management and support aircraft will remain the priority users of the SLF through the remaining years of the program. Available Capacity and Prioritization of Access: NASA is considering making available to non-agency users any SLF capacity not required for its use. Procedures for establishing priority in the event of conflicts or demand exceeding capacity will be developed using information received under this announcement. A preliminary priority order under consideration is:  1.	NASA 2.	Spacecraft or spaceflight hardware delivery 3.	Federal research or technology development  4.	Commercial or university research or technology development  5.	Parabolic flights for human space flight research or training 6.	Other flights consistent with the uses outlined above.  Environmental Impacts: Based on responses to this RFI, NASA will evaluate environmental impacts to determine if there are no significant impacts or if a more detailed assessment is needed. Detailed responses will assist NASA in this necessary activity to enable its intent to expand accessibility to the SLF by non-NASA users. Uses which require significant environmental analysis will have to be assessed at the user’s expense. Safety Impacts: Based on responses to this RFI, NASA will perform a preliminary evaluation of the risk to national assets, KSC personnel, and the neighboring communities. A detailed safety and risk description, including a risk mitigation strategy, will assist NASA in this activity. If the Government concludes the risk of the activity is unacceptable, additional mitigations may be required. NASA reserves the right to deny or prohibit any use or any activity the Government concludes can not be mitigated to an acceptable level. Future Plans for the SLF:  Although the Space Shuttle Orbiter is expected to be retired no later than 2010, NASA will have a continuing agency need for the SLF. With the nation embarking on a long-range exploration program to return to the Moon, and proceed to Mars and beyond, it is not possible at this time to predict the agency’s requirements for support and mission aircraft and spacecraft that may require use of the SLF. Accordingly, NASA does not expect to relinquish control or ownership of the SLF at any time in the foreseeable future. The agency may, however, explore the potential for out-leasing the SLF to an airfield operator at some future point to increase the efficiency of its operation for the benefit of an expanded set of users. NASA does not intend to pursue that option for the immediate near term but wishes to alert potential users that it may in the future. This RFI does not request, nor will NASA consider at this time, interest by potential airfield operators. Responders to this RFI are encouraged to comment on any of the foregoing and to express their interest in the SLF by submitting the following information: 1.	Organization name, address, principal activity, and primary point of contact. Describe whether responder is a Federal agency, contractor supporting a Federal agency, university or university-affiliated research institute or entity, other governmental entity (foreign, state, or local), or commercial operator engaged in space support services or research and technology development. 2.	Proposed use of the SLF and how it conforms to one of the categories of use identified in this RFI. Specific operational requirements and support needs should be identified to the extent known. Include a safety and risk description and describe how the proposed flight activity would not pose a threat to the national assets of KSC or the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, or if there is a risk, how that risk is proposed to be mitigated. Include any specialized security requirements or needs for specific site support. 3.	Identify any hazardous materials, including exotic propellants expected to be used in flight activities. List commodities and quantities required for on-site and aboard the flight vehicle, including but not limited to cryogenics, hypergolics, pyrotechnics, radioactive materials, exotic coatings, ablatives, bio materials, etc. 4.	Identify how many individuals would be involved in the proposed activity and whether these individuals are U.S. citizens or if foreign nationals.  Include country of origin if foreign. 5.	Identify the proposed frequency of flight activity and a profile of the missions intended to be staged from the SLF. 6.	Provide information on organizational or corporate experience in carrying out the activities proposed and evidencing financial responsibility and capacity for providing bonds or insurance that may be required. 7.	Provide technical descriptions of the aircraft or spaceflight vehicles proposed to be used in conjunction with SLF operations and any pertinent safety data on aircraft performance or reliability. Provide projected operational envelopes of the vehicle along with data supporting the qualification/reliability of the hardware and certification training of operators. 8.	For unpiloted aircraft or spaceflight vehicle operations, describe the proposed mission profile, the flight vehicle type, and how such operations would be carried out to avoid the risk to civilians, Government assets, or neighboring communities. 9.	For captive flights or release flights involving the test and evaluation of experimental space launch vehicles, whether piloted or unpiloted, describe the proposed mission profile, the aircraft and space vehicle type, and how such operations would be carried out to avoid the risk to civilians, personnel, Government assets, or neighboring communities. 10.	Any other information which the responder believes will help NASA determine whether to grant access to the SLF and in developing the policies and procedures to accomplish that objective. 11.	Specific comments to the description or factors with reference to the item to which the comment applies. Please provide input by following the above numbered  format to allow for efficient NASA review.  Responders are encouraged to suggest “pathfinder” flight activities to demonstrate potential uses and approaches consistent with NASA’s roles and missions. The terms and conditions of such “pathfinder” activities may not be the same as those established as a matter or policy for recurring, non-exclusive flight access. Failure to respond to this RFI will not preclude an organization from seeking access to the SLF if and when NASA determines capacity for non-NASA use exists and can be made available to users under terms similar to those described in this RFI. Release of this RFI does not commit NASA to implement expanded access to the SLF. Response to this RFI does not obligate NASA to grant access to the SLF. NASA reserves the right to determine what uses are appropriate for the SLF in light of agency requirements, and under what terms and conditions it will consider granting access to non-NASA organizations.	 NASA reserves the right to use submitted responses for NASA internal planning and the development of policies and procedures related to the proposed access to the SLF.  Although details of responses are meant only for NASA use, response submitters should not submit proprietary material. NASA expects to reply to all responders to this RFI and may engage those who expressing interest in desirable uses consistent with this RFI in a further exchange of information. NASA may also decide to hold a workshop at the Kennedy Space Center for parties responding to this RFI to further assist the agency in determining how to proceed in the anticipated expansion of access to the RFI. If such a workshop is scheduled, responders will be notified. No procurement is planned as a direct result of this Request for Information. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. All responses to this notice shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer at NASA, Kennedy Space Center, Mail Stop: OP-ES-B, Attn: Steve Parker, Kennedy Space Center FL 32899 no later than August 30, 2005. Please reference SLF2005 in any response.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to seek sources for two Sluice Gates to be manufactured and installed at Lake Lanier, Buford, GA. There is no solicitation at this time.  The Scope of Work involves the design, fabrication, and installation of two new se rvice sluice gates and the inspection and repair of all existing embedded metals utilized as sealing surfaces.  Each sluice gate shall contain a single, hydraulically operated, 38 inch jet flow gate valve. Wire rope hoists located at the top of the intake structure of the dam currently raise and lower the gates to provide supplementary releases. Each jet flow gate valve shall deliver 600 CFS when fully open under the normal pool elevation of Lake Lanier (EL. 1064).  The new service sluice gates themselves w ill no longer be raised or lowered to provide supplementary releases -- the jet flow gate valve in each gate shall be used to provide regulation of the supplementary releases while the new service sluice gates remain in place.  When inspection or maintenan ce of the service sluice gates is required, each will be raised by its corresponding existing wire rope hoist.  The sluice gates shall fit in the existing structure.  The sluice gates shall be designed such that they will not require modifications to the e xisting wire rope hoists.  The sluice gates may use a different hoist block assembly.  A new hydraulic pump unit and associated tubing and piping shall be provided to provide actuation of the jet flow gate valves.  Local and remote control of the jet flow gate shall also be provided.  Work scope shall also include all electrical design and installation as necessary in order to provide power to the new hydraulic pump, as well as to provide the required electrical control and indication for the new service sl uice gates. Work scope shall also include the design and installation of a complete corrosion control system including a coating system rated for immersion service and a sacrificial cathodic protection system to protect all submerged surfaces of the new gates.  The ca thodic protection system shall consist of magnesium anodes bolted to the gates rather than welding for ease of future replacements.  The Contractor shall be responsible for close coordination between the gate fabricator and the cathodic protection sub-cont ractor.  The gate fabricator shall coordinate with the corrosion expert as defined herein, to assure that anode mounting studs are welded to the gate in the correct locations during the gate fabrication.  All anode mounting bolts are to welded to the gat es, prior to painting and prior to leaving the fabrication facility. All painting shall be accomplished at the gate fabrication shop prior to delivery, except for touch up painting after gate installation.  Care shall be taken as to not damage mounting bol ts during the transportation and installation of the new gates.  The remaining cathodic protection installation and testing will be performed after gate installation.  The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this synopis nor re turn the data provided.  The results of this synopsis will be considered to be in effect ofr a period of one year from the date of publication of this notice.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Botswana Infant Formula
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to 
award a contract on a sole source basis IAW FAR 6.302-2 to ASPEN Pharmacare for the purchase of 40,400 cans of infant formula with an option line item to order an additional 60,000 cans at a future date to be determined later.  This effort is in support of the Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) program initiated by the implementation of the Presidents’ Emergancy Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).  The purpose of this contract is to provide the country of Botswana with a provisional supply of infant formula that would be appropriate for infants of the age from 0-6 months that is in powdered form and contained in a can.  As a result of the heavy reliance upon infant formula in Botswana due to the AIDS epidemic and coupled with the fact that the current supply of infant formula is scheduled to expire at the end of July, it is determined that this is a compelling and urgent need as human life is at stake.  Due to the compelling and urgent nature of this requirement, PMTCT will be exempt from any labeling restrictions as the healthcare workers thoroughly provide preparation instructions to mothers who do not understand 
English.  Although the Government intends to award a sole-source 
contract at this time, the need may persist until the Government 
of Botswana establishes its’ own contractual agreement.  With 
this in mind, all sources are invited to submit a record of 
capability to this office to be received by this office NLT July 
22, 2005 indicating the capability of meeting the specifications below for future requirements.  Keeping in mind that the need could exist for up to 100,000 cans to be delivered with a very short lead time, only organizations that can supply this quantity and meet the specifications below should respond. Be advised that this notice is not a promise of a need or a contract and the Governments’intent is to pursue this need only when a need arises.  


Specification:

1.	Powdered, tinned infant formula suitable for normal 
infants 0-6 months of age.
2.	Labeled in English
3.	Up to 100,000 cans
4.	Same time delivery

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.   Pursuant to Far Subpart 19.502-2(b) this acquisition is set aside for small business.  The Government contemplates award of a firm fixed price purchase order for a commercial, off-the-shelf software capability and training services.  The Government intends to award without discussions with Offerors.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if discussions are later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  Requirements:    (1) The vendor must provide re-usable, commercial, off the shelf software product(s); (2) that provides a team of business analysts i.e., at the enterprise level, with on-demand, automated methods to identify and catalog business logic incorporated into Unisys ClearPath; MCP COBOL74 & COBOL 85 source programs, Unisys ClearPath Master Control Program (MCP) Workflow Language (WFL) jobs, and Unisys ClearPath MCP DMS II database schemas.

The Offeror’s proposal(s) shall be submitted in two volumes:  The Proposal Transmittal Letter shall formally transmit the complete proposal and include the following items:  Introduction – showing corporate capabilities and overall approach to the statement of work.  DUNNS Number.  Federal Tax Identification Number POC email, phone, and fax number.  Volume 1:  technical, maximum 20 pages, single space, font size 12, 81/2x11, single sided.  Volume 1 shall address Factor 1 and Factor 2.  Volume 2:  price, maximum 3 pages, single space, font size 12, 81/2x11, single sided.   FAR Clause 52.212-2 Evaluation—Commercial Items applies:   (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government intends to award on the basis of best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The Technical Evaluation factors equal in Importance.  Factor 1:  Technical Capability.  Factor 2:  Past Performance.  Factor 3:  Demonstration of Software Capability.  Technical Evaluation Factors (taken in their entirety) are more important than price; however, between proposals that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, price will become a major consideration in selecting the successful offeror.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.   Technical Factor 1 shall be evaluated according to following adjectival scale:  Excellent, Vendor’s proposal is complete and thorough.   To receive this rating, vendor meets or exceeds mandatory requirements with little or no perceived risk.   Example:  Vendor provides additional functional capabilities and/or training, and/or helpdesk services not identified in the  mandatory requirements cited above.  There are no weaknesses and no deficiencies.    Good, Substantial response to each of the areas.    Vendor’s product meets mandatory requirements described above.  There are no significant weaknesses and no deficiencies.    Average:  Vendor’s proposal is responsive to requirements. It may be weak in substantiation of information or data presented.  There may be one or more significant weaknesses and no deficiencies.  Poor: A proposal may receive a rating of Poor for any of the following reasons:  Displays only a limited capability to meet requirements; lacks essential information to substantiate claims/data presented; or proposal omits required and pertinent information in major areas.  Technical Factor 2:  Past Performance.  The Offeror must provide a Project Profile for at least 3 projects.  Each Project Profile must represent work completed within the past 24 months.  Minimally acceptable information includes:  Name, Address, Telephone Number and Customer Point of Contact;  Type of Customer (i.e., Federal Government, State/Local Government, or Commercial/Private Organization). Contract Number (if applicable).  Total value of the Contract at time of Contract Award and Total Value of the Contract at time of Completion (value to date if an active contract).  Provide a brief summary of the causes for any increase/decrease in contract value. Required Delivery Schedule/Period of Performance and Actual Delivery Schedule/Period of Performance.  Description of services offered.  The Offeror shall note that the Government may consider all information available on the Offeror’s experience and past performance.  This may include information that is in addition to that which is provided to the Offeror.  The Government may also consider information available to it through Government records, industry databases (e.g., Dunn an Bradstreet), and other sources.    Technical Factor 2 shall be evaluated according to the following adjectival scale:  Excellent:  All survey responses were positive with regard to on-time and accurate delivery, cost control, responsiveness to customers and commitment to customer satisfaction.  All references have and/or would return to vendor to satisfy future requirements based on positive experience.  The vendor’s past performance history demonstrates no risk anticipated with delivery of quality products, on time, or any degradation of performance or lack of customer satisfaction (or cost growth if applicable).  Good:  All survey responses were positive with regard to on-time and accurate delivery, cost control, responsiveness to customers and commitment to customer satisfaction.  Any concerns were minimal or isolated and were satisfactorily addressed by the vendor (in follow-up).  All references have and/or would return to vendor to satisfy future requirements based on positive experience.  The vendor’s past performance history demonstrates very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality products, on time, or any degradation of performance or lack of customer satisfaction (or cost growth if applicable).  Neutral:  No Prior Past Performance.  Average:  At least two of the three survey responses were marginal or unsatisfactory with regard to on-time and accurate delivery, cost control, responsiveness to customers and commitment to customer satisfaction, and/or overall performance.  The offeror experienced periodic problems and/or was not consistently proactive in addressing issues or concerns.  Some references not as likely to return to the vendor to satisfy future requirements.  Some potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation or lack of customer satisfaction (or cost growth if applicable) based on the Offeror’s past performance.  Poor:  The Offeror’s past experiences are extremely weak, and/or inaccurate, and/or incomplete.  There is insufficient evidence to show that the contractor could perform the requirements of the SOW.  There are significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies.  Factor 3:  The Government shall require a Demonstration of Software Capability from the most highly qualified vendors.  The Demonstration shall take place at the Government work location at 1901 South Bell Street, Arlington, VA.  The Demonstration of Software Capability shall be consistent with the information provided in the Technical Proposal.  The Demonstration shall begin with a 10-minute introduction of all parties.  Following the Introduction, the Offeror shall have one hour to present their solution.  Following the one-hour briefing, the Government may brake for 30-40 minutes.  After the brake, the parties shall re-convene for questions and answers.   During the one hour demonstration, the offeror must illustrate that the proposed solution is user-friendly and role-based, and meets the requirements described above.  The provisions of:  52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items; 52.212.-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items; 52.212.-4, Contract Terms and Conditions; 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items and 52.212-2 apply.   Three copies of each response must be hand delivered or sent via an overnight courier service to Holly Carr, GSA FSS CIO, 1901 South Bell Street, Arlington, VA 22202.   Questions are to be received by nlt 11:00 a.m., est. July 6, 2005 .  Only questions submitted in writing by the designated time to the Contracting Officer will be considered.  A copy of the questions must be sent via E-mail to holly.carr@gsa.gov.  
QUESTION 1:  HOW BIG IS YOUR CODE BASE:  ANSWER:  The Government contemplates award for a firm, fixed price COTS tool that is reusable any number of times.  Therefore, there is not a definitive number of lines of code.  QUESTION 2:  Is your interest strickly to extract the business rules, or in-due course will be looking to migrate your application into another language such as java/J2EE or C#?.  ANSWER:  The specification is stated in the solicitation.  QUESTION 3:  Is it possible for you to send one of your COBOL programs, along with the referenced COPYFILES.  ANSWER:  The Government will distribute copies of the COBOL in accordance with this solicitation after proposals have been received.  QUESTION 4:  Approximately how much source code (module count, lines of code) are there of each of the following:  a) MCP COBOL 74;  b) MCP COBOL 85;      c) MCP WFL;  d) DMS II Database Schemas.

QUESTION 5:   Extraction of business rules is an extremely immature technology.  We are considering proposing tools to help GSA understand
the code better to enable business rule extraction, with an option to provide business rule extraction for a developing standard. This may run afoul of the phrase "offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced".  Is direct extraction of business rules extremely important to GSA, and if so, would a proposal shaped like this be problematic?
ANSWER 5  The Government requires a commercial off-the-shelf, reusable capability as described in the synopsis.  The evaluation factors are also provided in the synopsis.  We are interested in tools to enable business tools extraction from the systems.  As the systems are very dynamic, it is important that we have the ability to re-review the systems and update business rules on a continuing basis.  
 
QUESTION 6:  It appears that GSA is interested in Business Rule extraction really to support migation away from the ClearPath mainframe; can you clarify if this is the intended purpose, or is there another reason?       However, extracting Business Rules and reimplementing is one way to do this, because of the BR immaturity, this is not a very practical path at the moment.  Remarkably, it is possible to automatically migrate an existing application without extracting the business rules.  While one can reasonably argue that the existing BRs need re-formulation,  cleanup and change, and so migrating the code might not produce the ideal resulting application, one can also argue that surviving the migration and getting a running application is absolutely the first priorty, and that reengineering BRs after migration would decouple the two tasks and significantly reduce risk. Are GSAs long-term priorities to extract BRs and reimplement (at significantly higher cost and risk) or to migrate safely (lower cost, more effort later to modify business logic)?

ANSWER 6:  GSA does not want to migrate the existing applications to another hardware/software environment in the hopes of saving money on hardware, software, or developers.  The applications being discussed interacts with the Department of Defense (DoD) supply system.  The DoD supply system is undergoing a radical transformation.  Here is a concise summary:  1. All inputs and outputs within the supply system must change from the traditional 80-character formats to EDI/XML transactions; 2. A large percentage of the data fields within the 80-character formats are being expanded, i.e. a field is being expanded from 5 positions to 10 positions; 3. New data fields are being defined for the EDI/XML transactions; 4. New Business Rules are being created for the expanded fields and the new fields.  Selected parts, but not all, of the GSA applications being discussed must change to support these new DoD requirements.  GSA does not intend to migrate away from the ClearPath mainframe.  The Government’s requirement is described in the synopsis.  

QUESTION 7  The RFQ did not state a closing time on the 11th.  Is it on or before close of business on the 11th?  
ANSWER 7:  The closing time is 5:00 p.m. eastern standard time.

The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)/Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is seeking additional interested parties to expand the current partner base within a program known as CORANET II (herein referred to as CORANET) to actively participate in scheduled workshops, meetings, and short-term collaborative projects, for the purpose of arriving at scientific and technical solutions to improving the efficiency of the combat ration industry and its manufacturing supply chain.  The Defense Logistics Agency Combat Ration Network (CORANET) II program was established in 2001 to promote manufacturing improvements in the ration industry with the goal of maximizing capability and capacity to produce along with encouragement of modernization needed to leverage the latest technologies.

The period of performance for new awardees will be approximately 3 years consisting of one (1) base year and two (2) one- year options.
   
Current academic and industrial partners are contributing immensely to the goals of CORANET and are considered extremely important to the continued success of the program. However, recent changes in the mix of combat rations and revisions in the Military Service Requirements for applied research as well as the availability of new technologies point the need for new technical skill sets.

Therefore, the Government is looking for industry and academic institutions that have expertise such as, but not limited to, packaging material, full fielding of pocket sandwiches, advanced dehydration technologies, baked products, flameless ration heaters, institutional size pouches (see below for a more extensive explanation).  Interested parties are required to submit a proposal consistent with the factors identified in the proposal evaluation criteria section of this BAA.  The purpose of the proposal is to evaluate an offeror’s qualifications to become a CORANET partner.  Proposals shall be no longer than fifteen (15) pages.  

 The CORANET program is currently a $2.0 M per year DLA R&D effort focused on improving DLA’s ability to meet operational ration requirements, now and in the future. The primary objective of the program is for CORANET partners to initiate and complete short-term projects that develop and adapt modern manufacturing processes to be implemented within the industrial base to assure the prompt and sustained availability, variety, quality and affordability of combat rations.  Subject to availability of funds, a total Government investment of about $2 million per year is planned during Fiscal Years 2006-2008. This investment is distributed for the funding of current and future partnership contracts, one existing demonstration site and future short-term projects (STPS).  New partners chosen to participate will receive an estimated amount of $15,000 per calendar year to actively participate and attend CORANET workshops and other Government sponsored meetings. 

  Interested parties can visit the CORANET website at www.coranet2.org to obtain more information about the current program.

Proposers must submit of an original and eight (8) hard copies of full proposals (as well as an electronic file) and refer to BAA# 01-0004(R) by 3:00 PM, local Philadelphia time on August 23, 2005, to DSCP-Business Opportunities Office, Bldg 36, 2nd floor, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 1911 in order to be considered. No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. This is an unrestricted acquisition.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by DLA.  DSCP encourages industry, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions to submit proposals under this BAA.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in this technology. For purposes of this acquisition, the small business size standard is 500 employees and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541710, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences.  All correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including request for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to the POC at the top of the BAA; e-mail or fax is preferred. Proposals may NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded. 

It is the Government’s intention to award “partner” contracts based upon proposals that demonstrate knowledge, experience, and expertise in the technical areas of interest identified below.  The partner proposal must demonstrate an understanding in one or more of those technical areas of interest, or an area directly related to but not listed.  Proposals must provide information on past performance, which reflects related efforts and/or achievements, technological aptitude, management support, and potential contribution and relevance to DLA’s mission. 

The investigative areas below represent technology thrusts being led by academic and industrial firms that are under-represented in CORANET at this time.

A.	The Services continue to have interest in innovative packaging technologies that could potentially permit transition to non-foil pouch materials, which would be less expensive and have improved barrier protection, with a potential for active packaging, including oxygen scavenging. Both industrial participation of a packaging material supplier and an academic center of packaging expertise to complement the inherent packaging capabilities of the Natick Soldier Center are desired. 

B.	Full fielding of pocket sandwiches is delayed because of production challenges related to production of an acceptable product that can withstand military shelf-life requirements.

C.	Industrial partners with expertise in advanced dehydration technologies are needed to further exploit this and related technologies because Army group rations are making increased use of high quality dehydrated eggs for example, in lieu of retort items

D.	 Baked products in combat rations have problems meeting shelf life demands, while maintaining quality.   Universities having on-going research on the science of baked products, particularly under long-term storage conditions, are needed for extensive studies on refinements to reduction of water activity (Aw) in order to provide for a long-term shelf-stable baked product. An additional new thrust to remove trans fatty acids from baked goods also requires additional expertise in baking sciences

E.	Flameless Ration Heaters (FRHs) were a big step forward for the Services in making it possible to heat Meal, Ready-to-Eat entrees at the foxhole.  New partners are needed who have the chemical know-how to develop non-hydrogen emitting heating technologies which would more efficiently heat combat rations while concurrently reducing or eliminating environmental concerns without increasing weight, volume or cost of the rations.

F.	As the Services transition towards adoption of the Institutional Sized Pouch (ISP) as a shelf-stable, group field feeding option, academic institutions and film manufacturers and producers are needed who are involved in applied research or optimization of manufacturing processes for the ISP.

Award of a contract will result in becoming a partner in the CORANET program, which involves both the active participation in Government sponsored workshops and the requirement to directly submit or become actively involved in a collaborative STP(s).  Each organization participating in the performance of this program is a partner in the CORANET.  The collection of all these partners is known as the CORANET.  Each partner is required to bring specific technical expertise that lends itself to significant improvements of the combat ration industry’s ability to meet DLA combat ration needs.

The focus of CORANET is for all partners to actively and continuously assist DLA in improving its ability to meet/exceed a varying range of military requirements through research, development and technology transfer efforts as they apply to the combat ration and related industries.

All CORANET research and development efforts are expected to improve process capabilities by identifying targets for product, automation and business operations changes, and implementing solutions, with the final goal being shorter lead times, higher throughput, reduced inventory and overhead costs, and improved quality.   Unification of production methods for military and civilian products (dual use equipment and procedures) that improve producer flexibility to also satisfy civilian markets is especially important.  Proposed research and development should investigate innovative approaches that enable significant advances in manufacturing technology, devices or systems and then describe a path for implementation in the plants of ration producers.   

COMBAT RATION NETWORK FOR TECHNOLOGY IMPLEMENTATION (CORANET)

This call for proposals is for the expansion of the current Combat Ration Network for Technology Implementation (CORANET) partnership base. The CORANET consists of a group of individual organizations participating in the program, each of which is a partner in the CORANET.  The network of organizations includes, but is not limited to, universities, ration manufacturers, equipment manufacturers, equipment suppliers, material suppliers, and software developers. 

Combat Ration Network for Technology Implementation (CORANET) partnerships

Each potential CORANET partner is required to bring a specific technical expertise to advance the state of the art of manufacturing technology and to facilitate its implementation into the combat ration manufacturers that support the Military Services.  Primary consideration in the selection of a CORANET partner will be the relevancy of the offeror’s past and present related experience and technical expertise as it relates to potential for significantly improving the packaged food industry’s ability to meet DLA requirements.  
Each year the CORANET partners will be required to attend Government sponsored workshops for the purpose of participating in the CORANET process of planning technical strategy, identifying, developing and performing STPs, and reporting to the management team of the CORANET (known as the Joint Steering Group (JSG).  Each partner will be reimbursed for their attendance at these workshops and other related CORANET meetings.  Allowable and allocable reimbursable costs will include airfare, direct labor, car rentals/taxis/shuttles and a per diem for food and incidentals in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations. 

As part of the contract performance requirements, partners will be required to submit research ideas for implementation of short-term projects (STP). Partners may work together on one STP, or they may coordinate their efforts on individual STPs.  A short-term project is defined as a collaborative applied research and development effort aimed at improving specific elements of the combat ration production cycle with a clear technological application and implementation process.  An informational outlined of the format of an STP is provided below.  The duration of a typical STP is under 24 months.  Prior to initiating performance of STPs, all research ideas/proposals, which may be submitted by any academic or industrial partner, may be presented at a Government sponsored workshop for review and approval by the JSG whose members are from various government organizations.  The JSG is chartered by the DLA Program Manager and is established to assist in the management of the program.  The JSG members provide expertise in related technical areas, help to select and prioritize candidate short-term projects and monitor the progress of those projects.   In response to the research idea presented, and at the Government’s discretion, a funded delivery order or modification may be awarded against the CORANET partner contract for the execution of the STP with emphasis on implementation of results. Partners who are conducting STPs will be required to submit monthly progress reports, quarterly reports and a final technical report.  The statement of work and/or partner technical proposal which results in a contractual document will specify requirements, including Contract Data Requirements and any other deliverables.   

THE FOLLOWING FORMAT (PARAGRAPH 1 THROUGH 6) IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, AND OUTLINES A POTENTIAL PARTNER’S MINIMAL RESPONSIBILITIES IN SUBMITTING RESEARCH IDEAS (STPs) THROUGHOUT THE LIFE CYCLE OF THIS PROGRAM.  OFFERORS ARE NOT REQUIRED AT THIS TIME AND SHALL NOT SUBMIT A RESEARCH IDEA/STP IN RESPONSE TO THIS BAA.  PLEASE REFER ONLY TO THE PROPOSAL EVALUATION CRITERIA SECTION WHEN SUBMITTING A PROPOSAL IN RESPONSE TO THIS BAA.

(1) Degree to which proposed new and creative solutions to technical issues are important to the DSCP/DLA Combat Ration Industrial Base program and can be implemented in the supply chain. (see potential technical areas of interests identified above.)

(2) Feasibility and the offeror's understanding of the technical objectives and proposed approach.  

(3) The offeror's ability to achieve and implement results with the proposed approach, as demonstrated by earlier specific contractor accomplishments in the technical fields involved, by availability of qualified personnel, and by appropriate facilities.  Additionally, explain how the project will be managed, how results will be demonstrated, and how success will be measured.  Address management organization, tools, controls, methodologies, milestone events and performance duration.  Address using the FMTF site to demonstrate results, as a minimum requirement, or describe other suitable alternatives to establish a pathway for technology transfer.

(4) The degree to which technical data and/or computer software will need to be developed under the proposed contract, necessary to monitor and control new process devices and equipment.   (All technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed contract are to be delivered to the Government with unrestricted rights.)  Address technical methodologies and technology transfer mechanisms that will be utilized to solve the problem, the realism of the timetable and risks (time, cost, risk of failure) associated with the approach.  In the technical proposal of your program identify the portions that you intend to perform in house and the portions that you intend to subcontract, if any.

(5) Proposed estimated cost and duration.   Costs of actual STPs will be viewed not only in relation to the prospective value of the proposal, but also to the availability and level of Government funding for the CORANET program, as well as to the reasonableness of the proposed costs. (If the submitted proposal’s dollar value is estimated to be over $500,000, large business concerns are required to submit a Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan.) 

(6) Inclusion of tangible or intangible cost/benefits for the proposed effort.
 


PROPOSAL EVALUATION CRITERIA

This section identifies the evaluation criteria for submission of a proposal as a CORANET partner.  Offerors should submit a proposal consistent with the criteria identified below under Proposal Evaluation for CORANET Partnership. THIS BAA DOES NOT REQUIRE THE SUBMSSION OF A SHORT TERM PROJECT.  The selection of one or more sources for contract award will be based on a technical review by designated Government representatives of all proposals submitted in response to this BAA. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.  The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine relevancy of the offeror’s past history, relative technical merit, management approach, and the probability of implementing results for the benefit of DLA.   
 
The Government will evaluate all proposals in accordance with the following criteria set forth below.  It is the Government’s intent to award approximately six (6) to ten (10) new CORANET partners, among industry and academia. The Government may award fewer than 6 or more than 10 depending upon the number of proposals received and determined to be beneficial to the Government.  The actual number of contract awards will be commensurate with all evaluation results, consideration of those respondents which provide the most promising and beneficial proposals within the technical areas of consideration and as funding will permit.



PROPOSAL EVALUATION FOR CORANET PARTNERSHIP

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a detailed review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: 

	(1) PAST PERFORMANCE AND SCIENTIFIC/TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE
	(2) RELATED EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES
	(3) ORGANIZATIONAL AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT 
	 
	
(1) PAST PERFORMANCE AND SCIENTIFIC/TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE:  Offerors must provide information pertaining to prior significant and related work experience, or expertise in any of the listed areas of interest and how that expertise will be beneficial to this program. Offerors shall describe their track record in dealing with the combat ration industry (manufacturers, suppliers, government agencies, etc.) or other similarly complex integrated food research, development and acquisition activity.  Offerors must provide the five largest accounts/ contracts within the last three years for which they have provided services and/or supplies of a nature consistent with this program and the needs of the combat rations industry. Offerors shall include at least (2) points of contact and a telephone number for each account/contract, a description of the service or supply which was provided as well as a brief performance history on each of those accounts/contracts. Where related work was performed with teaming partners, provide points of contact of teaming members to include company name, individuals and phone numbers.  If no past performance related to the combat ration industry is available, offerors shall describe their track record in dealing with their comparable major customers and shall include similar supplemental information to that requested above for the combat ration industry.

(2) RELATED EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES:  Offerors must include a summary of all equipment and facilities (e.g., food processing, packaging, quality assurance, testing, modeling/simulation) which may contribute to the capabilities of the CORANET should the offeror be selected as a partner.

(3) ORGANIZATIONAL AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT:  Offerors must provide evidence of how the contract will be managed and that its organizational structure will ensure performance stability and reliable customer service and commitment to DLA and CORANET for the duration of the contract performance period.  Specifically, offerors must address those positions that would directly impact on contract performance and customer support, by naming key personnel to be made available during the contract and describing the duties of said key personnel. Offerors shall also identify a project coordinator that will be permanently assigned to the contract, and include the detailed qualifications of that project coordinator.  Offerors must address how this management structure will relate to the future submission and performance of STPs.  

Offerors should provide a direct labor charge for that individual(s) who is expected to be the primary representative to attend meetings, workshops or other related CORANET functions.

In summary, an offeror’s proposal must clearly address how its core competency will result in its success as a CORANET partner and in advancing the primary objective of the CORANET program, which targets reduced costs, improved performance/quality/Total Asset Visibility, expedited delivery and increased throughput. The relevance of the offeror's core competency and capability must demonstrate an understanding of the operational ration environment, including the level/depth of interaction with relevant Government agencies.  

 
 General Information


To be eligible for award of a contract, all prospective offerors,  must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources, adequacy of accounting systems under a cost type contract, ability to comply with performance schedules, prior record of past performance, integrity, organization structure, experience, operational controls, technical skills, facilities and equipment.  For additional information and guidance concerning qualifications and standards for responsibility of prospective contractors, please refer to Part 9 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

 This program currently has a demonstration site available which may be utilized by all CORANET partners.  Potential new partners can anticipate the use of the Food Manufacturing Technology Facility (FMTF) located in Piscataway, NJ for development and demonstration of the technology resulting from future efforts, and for maximum technology transfer.

Scope of Work

A.  The Contractor shall be required to conduct a full scope financial audit of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights’ (the Commission) annual financial statement for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2004.  

The audit shall be performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS), as specified in the most current version of the GAO’s Government Auditing Standards (GAS), and additional audit requirements of the OMB.  In conducting the audit, the methodology used shall be at a minimum, consistent with the most current version of the GAO/President’s Council on Integrity and Efficiency (GAO/PCIE) Financial Audit Manual (FAM).  Should there be any deviations from the methodology set forth in the FAM, the Contractor must provide documentation to the COTR on a timely basis, demonstrating how the Contractor’s methodology satisfies the requirements of the FAM.  The COTR shall be notified immediately of any significant deviations from the FAM.

B.  With respect to internal control, the Contractor shall obtain an understanding of the components of internal control and assess the level of control risk relevant to the assertions embodied in the classes of transactions, account balances, and disclosure components of the financial statements.  The Contractor shall also obtain an understanding of the components of internal control relating to the existence and completeness assertions relevant to the performance measures included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A).

With respect to MD&A, the Contractor shall assess whether the information and manner of its presentation in the MD&A of the Commission is materially consistent with the information in the principal statements. In performing this assessment, the Contractor shall consider the required supplementary information and shall follow the guidelines presented in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ (AICPA) AU Section 551, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, and shall perform the procedures described in the AICPA’s AU Section 558, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards. In addition, the Contractor shall obtain an understanding of the design of internal controls relating to the existence and completeness assertions over performance measures and determine whether they have been placed in operation, as required by OMB Bulletin 01-02, as amended, or the most current OMB audit guidance.

With respect to Required Supplementary Stewardship Information (RSSI) and Required Supplementary Information (RSI), the Contractor shall assess whether the information and its presentation is materially consistent with the information in the principal statements.  In performing this assessment the Contractor shall follow the guidelines presented in the AICPA’s AU Section 551, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, and shall perform procedures consistent with AICPA’s AU Section 558, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards.
 
With respect to Other Accompanying Information, the Contractor shall assess whether the information and its presentation is materially consistent with the information in the principal statements.  In performing this assessment, the Contractor shall follow the guidelines presented in AICPA’s AU Section 551, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, and shall perform procedures consistent with AICPA’s AU Section 550, Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards.


C.  As part of the USCCR FY04 Financial Statement Audit, the Contractor shall perform procedures to assess the effectiveness of the information system control environment.  The procedures will focus on evaluating the adequacy of information systems controls over the following GAO’s Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM) general control areas:

·	Entity-wide Security Program Planning and Management,
·	Access Controls (including mainframe system logical security and data center physical security),
·	Segregation of Duties (for data center management and operations),
·	Application Software Development and Change Control,
·	System Software Controls and Modification, and
·	Service Continuity.

This work will also be utilized by other USCCR personnel with respect to the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements.  Thus, the information system control environment review performed shall be coordinated with the COTR to ensure the work is completed timely enough for other USCCR personnel to use in performing their audits.

D.  The Contractor shall review the consolidated interim, draft, and final financial statement packages for compliance with USCCR requirements.  The Contractor shall document each review in the workpapers and notify the COTR of the results within seven (7) working days of the review.  Notification shall be in writing, through e-mail, or by fax.

E. Audit Documentation

All audit documentation shall be prepared in accordance with GAS and contain the required elements prescribed by GAS.  The contractor shall also consult the GAO/PCIE FAM for specific audit documentation contents.  At a minimum, audit documentation should include a summary memorandum documenting the conclusions reached on each significant internal control cycle, account balance, lead schedule, phase of the audit, audit adjustments, and on the overall audit.  Adequate indexing and cross referencing must exist.  The contractor shall also ensure that audit documentation contains the audit completion checklist FAM 1003. 

The Commission shall have ongoing access to auditors and audit documentation at all times.  USCCR will accept electronic work papers and adequately cross-referenced hard-copy files to meet this requirement.  These documents shall become the property of USCCR and shall not be disclosed outside of USCCR, unless required by statute or regulation, without the prior consent.

Audit documentation may also be subject to review by other Government auditors such as the GAO, therefore, the contractor shall make audit documentation available to the GAO or any other federal entity conducting a review or audit of USCCR. Based on the results of these reviews, the contractor may be required by the COTR to perform corrective action and/or additional work within the scope of the contract necessary to support its audit conclusions, if necessary.

Audit documentation shall be retained and safeguarded for a minimum of 2 years by the Contractor at no additional cost. Written approval must be obtained from the Commission's Office of General Counsel prior to destruction of any audit documentation. 

It is imperative that the Contractors protect all audit documentation from unauthorized access.  Only Contractor staff with a need to know shall have access to audit documentation.

Deliverables

POSITION DESCRIPTION
Background

Created in 1947 by the United Nations Participation Act, the United States Mission to the United Nations (USUN) assists the President and the Department of State (DOS) in conducting United States (U.S.) policy at the United Nations (UN).  An important function of the USUN is to keep the DOS informed of events at the UN.  USUN officers report on meetings and make recommendations to DOS as to what course of action the U.S. should pursue.  This information is also relayed to overseas American Embassies which have an interest in particular items under UN consideration.  The USUN is also a link between the U.S. Government (USG) and the UN Secretariat.  The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) of the U.S. Agency for Internal Development (USAID) maintains a liaison at the USUN to represent USAID’s views and interests and to report to USAID on the proceedings of UN activities.

Introduction

OFDA is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

OBJECTIVE

The International Organizations (IO) Officer will be assigned to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations (USUN) in New York.  The IO Officer will be the senior advisor and USUN authority on humanitarian affairs.

STATEMENT OF WORK

The IO Officer will serve as an authoritative source of information on humanitarian issues and humanitarian policy for USUN Ambassadors.

The assignment involves providing expert analytical and advisory support for the planning, development and execution of U.S. foreign policy within a broad and complex geographic or functional specialty area.  The work requires applying a rigorous analytical approach to data that is often vague, unsubstantiated or contradicts existing knowledge.

The work is complicated by the need to provide expert advice and guidance that influences the decisions and actions of senior policy officials and the need to quickly, accurately and decisively determine the relevance and significance of information to the policy interests of the USG.  It is further complicated by the need to produce widely disseminated analytical products that represent official assessments of complex issues and keep the policy-making and foreign affairs communities continuously informed of new issues and developments.

Contacts will be with DOS and USAID employees at all levels, personnel at U.S. posts worldwide, senior analysts and officials in other agencies, congressional staff, experts, consultants, researchers and educators and officials of non-governmental organizations.  Contacts occur in a wide variety of planned and unplanned, formal and informal settings, including open meetings and conferences where the IO Officer may be called upon to explain and defend U.S. activities.

•	Represent the U.S. in meetings of the UN General Assembly, ECOSOC and other UN bodies as directed, actively lobby members of other UN delegations and closely liaise with the UN Secretariat to develop consensus for U.S. positions and negotiate resolutions, statements and agreements on relevant issues and matters under the guidance of the DOS’ Bureau for International Organizations;

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute requires the following auditing/licensing services deliverables. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with format in FAR Part 12 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The acquisition will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial items.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number RFQ-NCI-50074-NG, includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-04 (6/05).  The North American Industry Classification Code is 541211 and the business size standard is $7M.  

Background:  
Pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act (FTTA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a significant program in patenting and licensing inventions with commercial potential.  The NIH Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) currently handles patent prosecution and licensing for the NIH and Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  OTT enters into approximately 150-200 new licenses each year.  Our active license load currently consists of approximately 1,200 royalty-generating licenses.  The OTT has been delegated authority to grant licenses of Public Health Service owned technology (including the technologies of the NIH and FDA) and 37 CFR 404.4 establishes that federally owned technologies shall be made available for licensing as deemed appropriate in the public interest.  In order to foster technology development and maintain the integrity of licenses and patents derived through technology transfer, OTT must maintain effective license monitoring procedures.  This is accomplished by monitoring activities in each license through developmental stages, the review of audits required under OTT licenses, and through special reviews conducted by contractors when certain concerns arise.  As part of the PHS license agreement, licensees are required to submit semi-annual or annual progress reports, which document the licensee’s progress with respect to the benchmarks.  The licensing specialist reviews the reports and determines whether or not the licensee is in compliance with the terms of the executed license agreement(s).  When sales are involved, the licensee must submit reports on annual sales along with payment in accordance with the terms of the individual agreements.  The licensing specialists, to ensure that the amounts are in compliance with the terms of the license, review those reports.  In instances where product sales are in excess of $2 million annually, the terms of most agreements provide for the conducting of audits to ensure reliability of sales figures and royalties paid to the NIH.

Contractor Requirements: 
Contractor shall provide services from a royalty auditing firm for reviews of licensee sales and financial records in order to determine if OTT has received proper royalty payment for use of NIH technologies.  In addition, the Contractor shall help ensure that the licensee is in compliance with the terms of the license agreement.  The Contractor shall conduct an audit of: License #: 271-2001/1, Licensee: Millennium Pharmaceuticals (Velcade). Product: Velcade, Patent #s: 6,699,835 and 6,713,446.

The base audit shall cover the period from 01/01/03 through 12/31/04.  Specifically, the Contractor shall test the gross sales figures for all areas where this product was sold and shall verify that Millennium Pharmaceuticals has accounted for all the licensed product sales.  A detailed calculation of royalties owed specific to this license and in accordance with the subject license agreement shall be performed by the Contractor.  Specifically, using appropriate accounting and auditing procedures, the Contractor shall conduct a limited audit that includes at least the following elements:  1. The Contractor shall conduct a financial compliance review as a preliminary preparation to the actual audit.  This process shall include a thorough briefing with the Government project officer prior to initiating work; a contract and license review; thorough review of the royalty statements of all previous periods; analysis of the licensee’s payment history; an interview of the licensee to determine the type of accounting system and data availability; preparation and mailing of audit confirmation letters to the licensee; and compliance review program formulation, 2. Based on the information accumulated under the compliance review preparation, the contractor shall conduct an on and off-site compliance review; 3.Upon completion of the actual audit (within three to four work days), the Contractor shall conduct an exit interview with the licensee to present the findings and to provide the licensee an opportunity to explain and/or correct any deficiencies found during the review.  In addition, a written, post-review report shall be prepared and delivered to the project officer on the final date of the period of performance with a debriefing of the findings.  The debriefing and written report shall contain all relevant raw data, auditing procedures, findings, analyses of reported findings, and conclusions; at a minimum; the report shall address the following highlights: 3.1 Comparison of data submitted with the licensee’s own internal records; 3.2 Comparison of licensee inventory with reported production of licensed product; 3.3 Comparison of licensee shipping and receiving records; 3.4 Determination of methods used and analysis of licensee calculations of royalties for each licensed product; 3.5	 Determination of the methods used and analysis of licensee’s input of sales data for each licensed product; 3.6 Comparison of location of licensee’s sales force with location of reporting offices; 3.7 Analysis of periodic sales fluctuation over period relative to season or period of licensee’s fiscal year; 3.8 Analysis of currency valuation versus licensee’s sales reporting for sales in foreign currencies; 3.9	Comparison of sales volume of products which are complimentary to the licensee’s product for the same reporting period.

Travel: The contractor shall travel to where the sales records are kept in order to conduct this audit.  It is estimated that one trip is required for three FTEs.  In addition, the Contractor shall only be reimbursed for reasonable travel costs that are allowable under Government travel regulations.  In addition, the travel time of employees will not be reimbursed at their hourly pay rates under this contract.  Records are located at Millennium Corporate Headquarters, 40 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.  All travel will be in compliance with the Federal Travel Regulations. 

In performing the statement of work herein, the Contractor shall provide 96 direct labor hours during the period of performance.  The labor hours exclude vacation, sick leave, and holiday.

Deliverables: On the final date of the period of performance, the Contractor shall deliver a report as described in the scope of work herein for the stated auditing period.  The Contractor shall submit one computerized disk containing the final report and two hard copies to the Project Officer at the following address: To: Project Officer, NCI, Office of Technology Transfer, 6011 Executive Blvd, Suite 325, Rockville, MD 20852.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Cisco Catalyst 3550, NNG05112364Q which was posted on June 13, 2005. You are notified that the following changes are made:  1.  QUESTION/COMMENT:	 Looking at Amendment One, I would like to know what NASA considers to lifetime replacement. Does it mean until Cisco classifies it as end-of-life? Or, until NASA decides to decommission them?  Also, a few vendors mentioned this is reaching end-of-life, so warranty would be 5 years past purchase date.	(are you familiar with this term, and were you aware of this)? REPLY:	Lifetime (reference Amendment 1) would mean until NASA takes them out of service. End of Life (EOL) is not relevant. 2.  QUESTION/COMMENT:	Regarding Solicitation NNG05112364Q for Cisco 3550 switches and the amendment 02 requesting a lifetime free replacement warranty for those switches.  Not sure if you are aware of the fact that there is an "END OF LIFE" for those switches in May, 2006.  They are suggesting that customers transition to the 3750 switch family. Not sure if this changes the requirement but under the above condition this should change the warranty for the 3550 switches, not lifetime but to some reasonable period say 4 years.
