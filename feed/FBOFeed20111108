<SUBJECT>59 -- RFI  SPACE  TT & C  MODERNIZATION PROGRAM
<SOLNBR>SMCC-1111
<CONTACT>LaToya  Payne latoya.payne.1@us.af.mil

<a href="mailto:latoya.payne.1@us.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) For SPACE TT&C MODERNIZATION PROGRAM
1.	This RFI is in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.215-3 (Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes - Oct 1997) and is published to obtain information for use by the United States Air Force Electronic Systems Center, Cryptologic Systems Division (CPSD), San Antonio, Texas, for market research and planning purposes only. 2.	This RFI is NOT a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or an announcement of a solicitation; it is only intended for information or planning purposes. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement.  Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any potential offeror's ability to submit an offer if a solicitation is released.  Any requests for a solicitation package will be disregarded.  The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the government will arise as a result of preparing submissions in response to this RFI and the government's use of such information.  Submittals will not be returned to the sender.  Respondents to this RFI may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals. 3.	CPSD will complete the initial development of a Space Telemetry Tracking & Control (TT&C) Cryptographic Modernization (CM) project for the Aerospace Vehicle Equipment (AVE) End Cryptographic Unit (ECU) information assurance product.  For this RFI, CPSD seeks to gather information regarding the capabilities of industry to modernize the KG-327/327A ECU to meet satellite information assurance requirements and timelines.  4.	If a program were initiated, CPSD would utilize an acquisition strategy that incorporates one or more contracts to design solutions using existing technology to replace/modify the KG-327/327A Space TT&C products.  The initial effort would consist of developing prototypes and creating design documentation through NSA Technical Review Board (TRB) #2 and USAF Critical Design Review after contract award.  In addition, there may be opportunities for contract options for:a.	Development and demonstration (develop, test, TRB #3, and NSA Type 1 certification), b.	Future follow-on production efforts (delivery of option award - include any insight to long lead items that could affect this). This modernized information product will implement multiple algorithms for both up-link and down-link simultaneously (CAROUSEL and BELSHAZZAR).  The final information product device(s) will be NSA Type 1 certified. 	5.	Upon receipt of a PKI certificate signed e-mail to brandon.jernigan@us.af.mil or javier.flores.5@us.af.mil, the matrix the government developed to capture form/fit/function specifications of the equipment listed in paragraph 4 above will be sent to interested companies. This matrix may become the basis for constructing the Systems Requirements Document (SRD) if the government decides to release a formal RFP.  
6.	This RFI issued by CPSD solicits industry to provide information only.  Responses should be sent via email to Brandon Jernigan (brandon.jernigan@us.af.mil) or Javier Flores (javier.flores.5@us.af.mil) no later than close of business on 5 Dec 2011.
 PROGRAM QUESTIONS1)	If this acquisition comes to existence, would you be interested in competing?  If so, would you be proposing as a Prime Contractor or Subcontractor? 
2)	Please provide your cage code and business size. 
a)	 If you are a Small Business, do you also qualify under any of the sub-categories: 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business, HUBZone, etc.) 
b)	For small business consideration, would your firm be able to compete under NAICS 334111, 334210, 334220, 334290, 334419, 334511, 517919, or 561621?  If not, why not? 
3)	Is your company foreign-owned, controlled or influenced?4)	Are you on one or more GSA schedules?  If so, which one(s)?
5)	Do you have an existing contract that can be used to perform the required work?  If so, what is the contract vehicle, how can we use it (describe the ordering / selection process), what are the names and contact information for the government contract officers?
6)	Do you have experience in the development and/or production of space-qualified NSA certified Type 1 devices?   Please describe your experience in one or two paragraphs.   Please provide any Commercial COMSEC Evaluation Program (CCEP) program information as well including the length of time to develop and receive NSA certification.
7)	Are you familiar with the CARDHOLDER algorithm?  What is your experience with this algorithm? 
8)	Are you familiar with the CAROUSEL algorithm?  What Government Furnished Information (GFI) or Equipment (GFE) would be required for your company to independently develop the Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Design (VHDL) for the CAROUSEL Algorithm? If the VHDL is provided as GFE, what documentation and/or special equipment would be required by your company to incorporate the CAROUSEL algorithm?  
9)	Do you envision a need to develop an interoperability specification to ensure interoperability with the ground operating equipment?  
10)	Based upon the KG-327/327A data packages, the government has identified four different options for  modernizing these devices:a)	Option 1 - Update the VHDL on the Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA); make any modifications required to the Key Management System (KMS), as well as make any required board changes to implement the CAROUSEL algorithm onto the target devices.  Develop and deliver Special Test Equipment (STE) to support the ECU.  The data package will be required to be updated.b)	Option 2 - Replace the current embedded solution with a single FPGA and make any required changes to the board to implement CAROUSEL algorithm onto the target devices.  Develop and deliver STE to support the ECU.   The data package will be required to be updated.c)	Option 3 - Develop a single printed wiring board with the crypto engines, and all other ECU functionality, embedded directly on it that can be inserted into both the KG-327/327A.  Develop and deliver STE to support the new ECU.  A re-procurement engineering data package will be required.d)	Option 4 - Develop a form-and-fit replacement for the KG-327A, replacing the CARDHOLDER algorithm with the CAROUSEL algorithm.  Develop and deliver STE to support the new ECU.  A re-procurement engineering data package will be required.
For each option, please provide the following information:
a)	Is this approach feasible? 
b)	Describe any anticipated risks and how these risks can be mitigated.
c)	Define your schedule to meet the government events and mitigate your projections of project risk? Please provide past program information that your company executed to support your estimates? Provide information for elapsed time in months between events.  (if you are using CCEP programs, please indicate)i)	Awardii)	System Requirements Reviewiii)	Preliminary Design Reviewiv)	Critical Design Reviewv)	Qualification/Security Verification Testingvi)	Functional Configuration Audit/Physical Configuration Auditvii)	Production Readiness Reviewviii)	Earliest production delivery
d)	What would be a typical Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for each option discussed above?  (Please assume either Firm Fixed Price or Fixed Price Incentive type contract with any recommendations on how to obtain the best price for the government.) 
e)	Please provide lessons learned for any similar projects?  

11)	What is your recommended approach (from the four options above or any other)?
12)	The government is considering an option to compete production for the effort.  This will require the developer to deliver a new or revised re-procurement drawing package as well as government use rights for all the software/firmware.  What is the ROM (a delta to the other ROMs already provided) to include this requirement as part of the development process?
13)	The government has a requirement for all Critical Technology Elements (CTEs) to be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 to enter formal development.  For your recommended approach, please provide us a list of the CTEs and their TRL, with a brief explanation.
14)	The government has a requirement for all Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 6 to enter formal development.  For your recommended approach, please provide us an estimate of your MRL, with a brief explanation.
15)	What is your understanding of the Versatile Depot Test Station (VDATS) program?  What would be the impact (cost, schedule and risk) to your suggested approach if VDATS was required?  
16)	Explain your choice of already-established commercial standard interfaces for data, control, and power connections (physical layer architecture) for AVE.
17)	The government is interested in understanding how we can take advantage of advances in the commercial market place. Are any of your commercial solutions capable of encryption/decryption with the same algorithm, mode, and key management plan?  In addition, could you discuss your data dissemination plan?

Contractor personnel performing services under the contract must be citizens of a NATO nation and have appropriate professional training and experience in a related field.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>HQ ACT is planning a 12-month experiment on at-sea radiation detection in support of counter-trafficking to run during 2012.</p>
<p>Minimum Sensor Requirements: Three battery-operated mobile gamma radiation sensors with at least 4L static sensitivity Sodium Iodide (NaI) or Cesium Iodide (CeI) crystal; resolution &lt;8%, typical 7.7% (137 Cs); 1024ch digital MCA, normalized gain 3 keV/ch; Energy Range of 25 keV to 3 MeV; Linearity &lt;1% (or 0.5 channel up to 1MeV, ,2% up to 3 MeV; Count Rate Range of 0 to &gt;100,000 cps; Peak Shift of less than 1% (or 1 channel). System sensitivity should be no less than the following for the various isotopes listed using cps per nSv/h as the unit of measure:</p>
<p>&bull; Am-241: 120<br />&bull; Co-57: 120<br />&bull; Ba-133: 85<br />&bull; Cs-137: 37<br />&bull; Co-60: 24</p>
<p>The Dynamic Detection Performance should have a user-settable threshold options. Alarm conditions should be settable per isotope. The False Alarm Rate (FAR) no more than 1 for 10,000. The short-range dynamic identification capability must be equal to or better than ANSI N42-38 table 3 at 1m. The system must have a dynamic standoff detection and identification capability. The system must be self-calibrating between maintenance and/or recommended upkeep cycles.</p>
<p>Supporting Hardware/Software Requirements: The system needs a small, easy-to-handle external wireless or waterproof cable wired control unit that is saltwater spray resistant so that it can easily be used by boat crewmembers during mobile survey missions. The control unit display must be readable in bright sunlight or in darkness. The system needs to have one primary and one backup rechargeable battery. The battery must be able to recharge using either 110 VAC or 220 VAC and 50 or 60 Hz power supplies. Battery life must be no less than four hours while the unit is operating.</p>
<p>The system software must operate in English and be able to record background and detected isotope spectroscopic data, and output that data in ANSI 42.42 Extensible Markup Language (XML) schema format. The system should automatically record background, detected spectroscopic data, and have a manual mode that allows the user to order the recording of spectroscopic data. The software needs to provide innocent alarm discrimination and immediate threat characterization. Data export must be possible at least using standard USB connections.</p>
<p>Supporting Hardware - Containerization Requirements: The detection system must be contained in a case that can protect the system from saltwater spray or splash, and which contains sufficient shock-mounting to protect the system from the moderate jarring that could occur in small boats in low-to-moderate sea states. The total system size for the detector including the container cannot exceed 2 meters in length, or 40 kg in weight. The user interface unit and batteries will also need a hard plastic or metal case with form-cut padding that will allow the components to be safely stored on board ship in cool, dry spaces when not in use.</p>
<p>Training Requirements: 1 day user training (including electronic versions of training materials) to include:</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State intends to award a time and materials contract, with firm-fixed price and cost reimbursable elements, for local guard services, on behalf of the American Mission to Pakistan required to prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks. The US Embassy in Islamabad along with US Consulates in Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar require a secure environment to conduct their mission. Duties will include, but not be limited to, restricting entry of unauthorized personnel, operation of walk-through metal detectors, and hand-held detectors.
<p>The Government will solicit this requirement as a full and open competition using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code for this procurement is 561612 Security Guards and Patrol Services. The Government plans to award one contract. Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options, which shall be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government. The estimated number of annual hours for standard guard services is approximately 6,991,210 hours.</p>
<p>All Contractor personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor in accordance with Pakistan law. The U.S. Government will certify suitability of all Contractor personnel for employment under this contract. Level 3 English language proficiency is required for all Supervisors and Level 2 is required for all Senior Guards. Some other positions require English proficiency levels as shall be identified on the Exhibit A. Level 3 English proficiency requires the ability to satisfy minimum courtesy requirements and maintain very simple face-to-face conversations on familiar topics.<br /><br />The Government plans to issue the solicitation on or about December 1, 2011 at www.FedBizOpps.gov. No paper copies will be mailed. All announcements and amendments made to this solicitation will be posted to www.FedBizOpps.gov. To receive updates, click the link for "Register to Receive Notification."</p>
<p>The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: the synopsis will be posted for approximately fifteen (15) days then the solicitation will be posted and the Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) period lasting thirty (30) days will begin. The site visit -- that it is&nbsp;NOT mandatory to attend -- will take place approximately 15 days after posting of the solicitation. It is the contractor's responsibility to obtain required visas. The solicitation will be open for sixty (60) days and proposals must be received by close of business on the sixtieth (60) day. Award will be made approximately forty-five (45) days after proposal submission. All dates are subject to change. Offerors will be notified by amendment to the solicitation posted on FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>All proposals from responsible vendors will be evaluated if received on time. All prospective offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award. No questions concerning this requirement will be answered until the solicitation is posted. Once the solicitation is posted, questions may be submitted by email to Jon Troyer at troyerjr@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>The contract will be awarded to the best technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price unless otherwise advised.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation.  This is a pre-solicitation notice that Solicitation No. W912EF-12-B-0003 is scheduled to be posted to the FBO website on or about November 23, 2011. The solicitation is scheduled to be issued as an Invitation for Bid. <br><br>Project title:  Lower Granite Trash Shear Boom Repair. The work is located at the Lower Granite Lock and Dam located in Garfield County, Washington. This will be a firm-fixed-price construction contract. Construction magnitude is between $500,000 and $1,000,000, and 100% performance and payment bonds will be required. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 237990 and the associated small business size standard is $33,500,000. <br><br>Summary of Scope of Work<br><br>General: The Lower Granite Trash Shear Boom is a floating structure in the forebay of Lower Granite Dam that was designed to direct floating trash and debris away from the powerhouse turbine intakes. The boom consists of 5 spans held in position by four intermediate floats. Each intermediate float is held in place by two anchors-one on the upstream side and one on the downstream side, with a chain/wire rope/hardware system linking the anchors to the intermediate float.<br><br>Current Conditions: The condition of the Trash Shear Boom Anchorage System is a concern because some existing wire ropes have broken and had to be replaced temporarily with poly ropes tied off to the existing shore anchors. One of the upstream anchor lines that had broken previously was replaced in the winter of 2006-2007. It is anticipated that anchor and anchor line should be in good condition for another 20 to 25 years. This scope of this contract will be to replace the remaining seven anchors/anchor line systems that are still original equipment or are presently tied off to shore anchors. If the trash boom were to come loose from its anchorage, it could end up lodged in either the Spillway Weir surface passage or the turbine intakes.<br><br>Construction Contract: Using government furnished property-10,000 to 18,000 pound stockless anchors, wire rope, chain, and miscellaneous hardware-assemble the anchorage lines and set the anchors in the river bottom, and connect anchorage lines to the existing intermediate floats to hold the trash shear boom in place.<br> <br>Tasks for this contract include:<br>1. Using government furnished property, install three upstream and four downstream anchors, anchor lines, and hardware to keep the floating trash shear boom in position in the forebay of Lower Granite Dam. <br>2. Shorten the first span of longitudinal wire rope cable to approximately 10-20 feet.<br>3. Remove existing and install new (GFP or contractor provided?) backstrap.<br>4. Re-install chain from trash shear boom floats to the 2-inch mainline.<br>5. Inspect boat access and replace wire rope cables from the frame to the floats.<br>6. Inspect 2-inch main line on entire trash shear boom.<br><br>The contract activities will require support of a barge mounted crane, a dive tender, and various work boats and/or barges. Shore crews shall assemble the anchorage lines onshore for installation by marine crews. Many of the tasks must be performed or supported by dive crews. Most dives will be in the range from the water surface to depths of 20 feet, but a few deep dives up to 120 foot depths will be required. Construction is restricted to the Snake River in-water work window (December 15, 2011 through March 1, 2012) but the anticipated contract award date will likely not allow the contractor to begin on-site work until late January, so construction will most likely take place in inclement weather. Safety will be a concern with crane lifts of heavy items; icy conditions; work over water; and work in the forebay of Lower Granite Dam upstream of turbine intakes, conventional spillway gates, and the Spillway Weir surface passage.<br><br>Additionally, the contractor will be required to provide a Project Superintendent, Quality Control Manager, and Site Safety and Health Officer. The Site Safety and Health Officer will not be allowed to perform the duties of either the Project Superintendent or the Quality Control Manager. However, one person could perform the duties of both the Project Superintendent and the Quality Control Manager. The person/persons assigned to those positions must meet the following requirements:<br><br>Quality Control Manager-<br>1. A minimum of 5 years experience on similar projects requiring over-water work.<br>2. Completion of the "Construction Quality Management for Contractors" course within the last 5 years.<br> <br>Site Safety and Health Officer-<br>1. A minimum of 5 years safety work experience on similar projects. <br>2. Completion of the 30-hour OSHA construction safety class or equivalent within the last 5 years.<br>3. Completion of an average of at least 24 hours of formal safety training each year for the past 5 years.<br>4. Competent person training as needed<br><br>Other information:  Bids will be due no sooner than 30 calendar days after actual solicitation issuance date. The due date will be contained in the solicitation and any solicitation amendments that may be issued. A site visit will be offered. The solicitation will include details about the site visit. ACCESS FOR FOREIGN NATIONALS: Security clearance for foreign nationals to attend a site visit requires approximately 4 weeks; therefore, clearance should be requested immediately. To request clearance, please submit the names of all foreign nationals proposed for site visit attendance, along with documentation to verify that he/she was legally admitted into the United States and has authority to work and/or go to school in the US.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: This is a required annual market research update in support of the anticipated CMWS PBL support contract for CMWS.  If respondents to last year's RFI are satisfied with their original submissions, the USG only asks that they validate their earlier submission with an email so stating so that the USG is aware of the current breadth and depth of industry interest in this research update.   Updated submissions are welcome, but are not required, nor are they a necessary first step in being able to respond to the anticipated RFI.<br><br>This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI). This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations to select the best alternative for a full service Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract in support of the AN/AAR-57, Common Missile Warning System (CMWS). This is a required annual market research update in support of the anticipated CMWS PBL support contract for CMWS.  A future solicitation/contract may provide PBL support and management services for the CMWS, component parts, and test sets, located worldwide. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government (USG). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the USG to form a binding contract.  <br><br><br>BACKGROUND: The CMWS is considered critical mission-essential equipment used aboard all rotary wing and most fixed wing aircraft. It is the core element of the Suite of Integrated Infrared Countermeasures (SIIRCM) concept and is a US Army Acquisition Category IC (ACAT IC) program. The CMWS program is satisfying the Army's requirements for enhanced aircraft survivability against Infrared (IR) guided threat missile systems. The CMWS is the Aviation IR Survivability capability provider for the Future Force. It will also complement, supplement and interface with other Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) to provide broad-spectrum platform protection. Enhancements will continue to significantly reduce aircraft and aircrew casualties and permit extended operations within battle space environments populated with threat missiles. The CMWS configurations vary by platform; currently there are 12 system versions. <br><br>The CMWS performs missile detection and classification, false alarm rejection, and missile declaration functions. The CMWS also sends a missile alert signal to on-board avionics and other ASE.  In turn, visual and aural warnings to the aircrew are provided by on-board avionics systems. Commands are issued to dispenser systems to eject decoys to provide for expendable countermeasures against an incoming infrared missile. Each Electro-Optic Missile Sensor (EOMS) collects in-band electromagnetic radiation, converts it to electrical signals, and supplies these signals to the Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The ECU analyzes this data to determine the existence of a missile threat. If a threat exists, the ECU transmits missile threat messages to the APR-39 for further processing, threat display, and audio cueing or the ECU transmits audio directly to the Inter-Communications System (ICS) and displays the threat via the Control Indicator (CI) or Multi-Function Display (MFD). Both the visual and aural indications provide threat type and relative position information to the pilots. If the ECU determines that a missile launch has occurred, it supplies a command signal to the sequencers. The sequencers process the Dispense Command Signal and then send a flare launch command to the dispensers, firing a flare solution. Providing the CMWS is armed, a Flare solution will dispense automatically in an attempt to counter the incoming missile associated with that interaction. The Digital Control Display Unit (DCDU) or CI, located in the cockpit, provides the pilot and co-pilot with interface to the CMWS. The DCDU and CI display system status information, Improved Countermeasure Dispenser (ICMD) inventory, and software version number. In the event of an ECU failure, the MODE switch on the DCDU can be set to BYPASS to allow manual dispensing of munitions. <br><br>The CMWS is currently supported through Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) by a two level maintenance concept that includes field and depot level maintenance. In accordance with Title 10, USC statutes, Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) repairs the ECU through a subcontract with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Organic repair capability (through TYAD) for the EOMS will be established and will commence with a target date of 1QTRFY13. The approved Army Procurement Objective is 3,916 A-Kits and 2,002 B-Kits. B-Kits are issued as Mission Kits to Aviation Units being deployed into threat environments, and to select OCONUS-based units as directed by HQDA, DCS/G-3. The Mission Kit Concept allows a smaller population of CMWS B-Kits to accomplish the desired mission, and places control of the B-Kits at a higher decision authority. B-Kits not installed are stored in a centralized location. Technical Data is available and can be provided upon request. The anticipated PBL contract will cover engineering support, core depot capability, Packaging, Handling, Shipping and Transportation (PHS&T) and program management. Software sustainment will transition to the CECOM Army Reprogramming and Analysis Team (ARAT). Some collaboration/interface between the PBL contractor and the OEM and/or CECOM ARAT may be required.<br><br>This RFI is intended to provide a forum to identify opportunities to decrease CMWS sustainment costs, improve CMWS sustainment efficiency, and increase sustainment readiness for CMWS customers. Disclaimer: This Market Research and RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered a RFP or IFB, an obligation from the USG to acquire any products or services, or an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization. This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for information solicited. This information is subject to change and in no way binds this office to pursue any course of action described herein. If this office chooses to issue a RFP at some future date, another notice will be published. <br><br>OBJECTIVE: This office will utilize a full service PBL contract implemented through a Public Private Partnership. The PBL team will consist of a Product Support Integrator (PSI) (responsible for integrating all sources of support defined within the scope of the PBL contract to achieve desired outcomes) and multiple Product Support Providers (PSP) (service providers involved in sustainment of an acquisition system). This office is searching for the best commercial source to serve as a Product Support Provider. The overarching objective is to reduce cost without degrading current system readiness and reliability for both peace and war time arenas. <br><br>The USG contemplates issuing a solicitation under FAR Part 15 that may result in the award of a five year Firm-Fixed Price contract. Estimated award date is NLT 4QTRFY12. PM IRCM will serve as the single Product Support Integrator (PSI). PSP Partnerships (in addition to a required Commercial Services Agreement with TYAD) are acceptable and encouraged as long as a single point of accountability for product support is identified. PM IRCM intends for the commercial PSP to partner with DLA through a non-binding partnering agreement to manage those items IAW FAR Part 51. <br><br>RESPONSES:  The USG requests submission of a written response to this RFI no later than 30 calendar days after the release of RFI. Responses shall be limited to 15 one-sided pages. Submission shall be capable of being printed on 8.5 x 11 inch paper with one inch margin (top, bottom, left and right) and a 12 point Arial or Times New Roman font.

<DESC><strong>"NIDDK Biosample Repository"</strong>
<p>"This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>. The NIDDK conducts and supports much of the clinical research on the diseases of internal medicine and related subspecialty fields. Many of the large clinical studies funded by the NIDDK collect biospecimens from subjects for analysis and future study. The collection of these patient and control samples from many different studies in a single repository is a valuable resource with which researchers can rapidly validate clinical hypotheses and algorithms for clinical decision. The collection also advances the development of prognostics, markers, and therapeutics for diseases related to the mission of the NIDDK. This project, referred to herein as the "Biosample Repository", continues an important collection begun in 2003 and is conceptually related to repositories in existence at other institutes at the NIH.</p>
<p>This repository stores and maintains biosamples under high quality conditions, and distributes them in an equitable and ethical manner. This facilitates the sharing of NIDDK-supported resources, thus encouraging work by junior investigators, investigators with novel approaches, and others not included in current collaborations without excluding those who are established in their fields. It helps to ensure that research participants make a maximal contribution, and decreases duplicative sampling efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and objectives</strong>. The objective of this requirement is to continue the NIDDK Biosample Repository in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner, to receive and store biosamples collected in many different studies, carry out specified sample processing and analyses, and widely distribute biosamples to qualified investigators.</p>
<p><strong>Project requirements</strong>. The tasks to be performed under the new requirement include, but are not limited to the following: (a) establish biospecimen preparation, shipping, receipt, and tracking systems for numerous individual multi-center clinical studies; (b) maintain the confidentiality of subjects by removing all traditional personal identifiers from samples; (c) establish one or more subcontracts for timely and cost-effective shipping of biosamples between multiple sites and the repository and for timely and cost-effective laboratory processing and/or testing of biosamples; (d) store biosamples under optimal conditions to minimize loss, damage or contamination; (e) distribute biosamples to qualified investigators granted access by the Project Officer, including packaging, handling, and coordinating sample shipments to domestic and international sites; (f) withdraw and destroy samples from the repository as directed in writing by the Project Officer; (g) establish agreements to receive, process, store, and distribute samples from NIDDK-supported studies; (h) establish and maintain Quality Control (QC) and Quality Assurance (QA) programs; (i) provide security and back-up systems and a plan for disaster recovery; (j) maintain high quality, secure information systems to allow detailed tracking of sample receipt, processing, storage and distribution, rapid retrieval of samples, storage of QA/QC information associated with the sample, and listing of investigators using the repository; and (k) work in a cooperative fashion with the Project Officer, the External Advisory Committee and the Steering Committee.<br /><br /><strong>Anticipated period of performance</strong>. It is anticipated that the period of performance will be for five years beginning approximately in June 2012.<br /><br /><strong>Capability statements/information sought</strong>. Respondents must submit a capability statement that demonstrates the potential offeror's qualification,, experience, and expertise, specifically providing evidence for the following: (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information.<br /><br />Interested offerors must submit five (5) hard copies of their capability statement. This should be limited to fifteen (15) pages. Each respondent should include their DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.<br /><br />The intention of this announcement is to survey the market for potential offerors. No large businesses should respond to this announcement. All interested small businesses including veteran-owned small business, service-disables veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns must provide copies of their capability statement on or before November 18, 2011 at 12:00pm Eastern time to Mr. Richard Bailey, Contract Specialist, NIDDK Acquisitions Branch, Two Democracy Plaza, Suite 700W, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, MSC 5455, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-5455. If the response is hand-delivered or sent by express delivery service, use Bethesda, Maryland 20817.<br /><br />General questions may be emailed to the following addresses: Richard Bailey, Contract Specialist, baileyrichard@mail.nih.gov; or Edward Kostolansky, Contracting Officer, ekostola@mail.nih.gov.<br /><br />"<strong>Disclaimer and Important Notes</strong>. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organizations qualifications to perform the work.

<p>Title: iPSC Stem Cell Lines and other Requested Material (NIH-CRM)</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) on behalf of the NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine (NIH-CRM) is interested in seeking small business sources for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), differentiation of iPSCs, targeted gene insertion of iPSCs, and reporter gene insertion into iPSCs. This SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT (SBSS) is being issued to help determine the availability of qualified small business companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), NOR IS IT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the requesting party to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this SBSS. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this SBSS. This FedBizOpps SBSS is strictly for market research. Acknowledgement of receipt of response will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of Government's evaluation of the information received. As a result of this SBSS, the Government may issue a RFP; however, should such requirements materialize no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to the SBSS.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990 with a size standard of $7.0 million.</p>
<p>Based on the responses received from this SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the NHLBI may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award Multiple Award Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for each task or a combination of tasks (refer to tasks below). If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>All eligible small business concerns responding to this SBSS Announcement must have the capabilities to provide the below services upon receipt of contract.</p>
<p>NOTE: if the SBSS results into a small business set aside solicitation, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, the prime contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for services, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.</p>
<p>Task 1. iPSC generation<br />The contractor shall generate iPSC lines tested for pluripotency using zero-footprint and feeder free technologies from tissue source to be specified in each task order's statement of work (but not limited to: skin, blood, mononuclear cells, marrow, CD34 cells, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes). A minimum of 106cells that are karyotypically normal and are grown on either feeder or feeder free conditions will be provided aliquoted into at least three vials.</p>
<p><br />The Contractor shall demonstrate the ability to automate or parallel process to generate large numbers of lines.</p>

<p><strong>Contracting Office Address:<br /></strong>Defense Information Systems Agency, DITCO-Scott PL8223, 2300 East Drive, Bldg 3600, Scott AFB, IL, 62225-5406</p>
<p><strong>1. The following provision applies to this Request for Information (RFI).<br /></strong>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997)<br />(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.<br />(b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.<br />(c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of conducting Market Research which will be used in the development of the Acquisition Strategy and Performance Work Statement (PWS) for the European Telecommunications Requirement.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The FAR is available on the World Wide Web and can be found at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil or http://www.arnet.gov.far/</p>
<p><strong>3. Description.<br /></strong>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal or a promise to issue a Request for Proposal in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>All businesses (large and small) are requested to respond to this RFI to assist the Government in formulating an acquisition strategy that fairly considers the ability of all businesses to participate in the acquisition, either as prime contractors or as subcontractors. Businesses are also requested to advise of the availability of any existing GSA Schedules or Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) that could be considered to fulfill this requirement.</p>
<p>Responses should include descriptions of recent (within the past three years or work that is on-going) and relevant experience (work similar in type and scope) to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact with telephone numbers where the responder performed the relevant work. Marketing brochures and/or generic company literature will not be considered. Not addressing all the requested information may result in the Government determining the responder is not capable of performing the scope of work required.</p>
<p><strong>4. Requested Information:<br /></strong>Interested vendors are requested to submit a statement of their knowledge and capabilities to perform the following:<br /><br />The purpose of this requirement is to obtain worldwide wireless services and hardware for Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM/GPRS) telephone services (approximately 15k devices), wireless Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs)/Smartphone e.g. Apple, Android, and other new technology systems as they emerge, hardware and services, other wireless and data services, and international indirect dial services ("99 access to DSN, approximately 40k numbers) for all Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) activities within the Europe footprint, which may include the US European Command (USEUCOM), US Central Command (USCENTCOM), and US African Command (USAFRICOM) areas of responsibilities (AORs).</p>
<p>The Government currently has two contracts in place that are expiring. The Government's intent is to combine them into one contract, plus add the ability to use new technology data devices such as iPhone, Android, tablet devices (iPad), etc. One contract is GSA's FTS2001 contract for commercial access International Dial (IID) Service within the European area of operations using 5th Signal Command's existing local circuits. The FTS2001 contract provides for the ability to dial commercially from the DSN telephone network. Presently, 5th Signal Command's existing local circuits which provide connectivity to the PSTN are PRI (Primary Rate Interface) based. However, Army 5th Signal and other DoD entities are interested in understanding what IP-based connectivity options may be available either at present or in the future from telecommunications carriers. Therefore, as part of the response to this RFI, respondents should assume that all near term connectivity will PRI-based but provided items detailing IP-based access options for informational purposes. Migration from PRI based connectivity to IP based connectivity is viewed as a long term goal. The second contract is with Vodafone to provide wireless hardware and services primarily to include wireless voice and data services for cellular phones and Blackberries. Wireless (cell phone, Blackberry, smart phone) needs include hardware and service for voice and data, Universal Mobile Telecommunications (UMTS) for data type services and international roaming. It is the Government's intent to combine both expiring contracts into one new contract in order to provide a business solution, for IID and wireless/data services that will increase efficiency of service though one service provider, consolidating technologies and systems, and leveraging a business solution to provide better service at a lower cost. It is the Government's intent to be able to add new technologies during the life of the new contract. Any additions, changes, or upgrades that incur additional costs to the new contract must be jointly agreed upon between the contractor and the Government, and approved by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. A draft PWS is included with this notice. Interested parties are requested to review the PWS and provide their comments as part of their response to this RFI. The PWS includes three attachments:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Attachment 1 - Call Data Volume and Utilization<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Attachment 2 - 5th Signal Corps Telephone System Hardware Infrastructure Outline<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Attachment 3 - Example Comma Separate Values (CSV) File.</p>
<p>Comments on the PWS or PWS attachments are to be provided in the format provided as Attachment 4 - PWS Comment Format. Comments will be reviewed for incorporation into future documents that might be developed as a result of this RFI. There will be no posting of all comments received from this review of the PWS.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Stennis Space Center (SSC)is seeking to identify potential industry interest in an agency real property assetlocated at SSC. This announcement describes a NASA asset that is currently underutilizedas a result of program cancellation.  SSC also seeks through this announcement to ensure broad awareness and visibility of theanticipated opportunities for Public-Private and Public-Public Ventures (PPV) betweenNASA and industry or non-federal public entities. Such ventures are defined as partneringtools in NASA's Real Property Management Program to leverage underutilized Agency realproperty to maximize utilization and efficiency. NASA may use a PPV to grant a partner aninterest in real property for a specified term through an instrument such as a lease, ause permit, or other form of legal agreement authorized by the National Aeronautics andSpace Act of 1958.  In addition to PPV agreements, NASA may pursue other approaches, asdescribed in this announcement, to enable others to use facilities for which SSC has acurrent or future need to support NASAs mission.  It is NASA's intent to ensure fairness to all parties and to ensure best value to theGovernment in granting use of a NASA facility in a manner that optimizes its support forthe agency's missions and objectives, and the U.S. national space policy.  To meet these purposes, NASA requests written responses to this announcement to assistSSC in achieving the following objectives:  * Identify and document specific interest from industry and non-federal public entitiesin pursuing a real estate agreement with NASA for use of the SSC facility identified inthis announcement.  * Assess the extent of overall interest by industry and non-federal public entities inusing underutilized NASA assets on SSC to engage in activities supportive of NASAsmissions and purpose.  * Provide data to support SSCs planning for infrastructure and facility utilization.  * Identify and document alignment with Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics(STEM) efforts related to the commercial space and aerospace industry.	* Enable determination of how underutilized capacity at SSC may be made available in afair and responsive fashion to industry and/or non-federal public entities to advanceagency and national objectives.  The facility identified in this announcement that is anticipated to be partially or fullyavailable for other users may subsequently be deemed by NASA as unavailable due to theagency's own facility needs.  The Government may apply selection criteria and make the facility and its related assetsavailable only if deemed in the Government's best interests. NASA reserves the right toproceed with development and negotiation of one or more proposed PPVs or other partneringand facility utilization agreements with respondents to this announcement, withoutfurther notice, if it determines that it has met the purposes, intent and objectivesidentified in this announcement.  NASA is not precluded from entering into real estate agreements with other federalentities for use of the SSC facility identified in this Notice of Availability regardlessof expressions of interest and proposed use that may be received from industry ornon-federal public entities pursuant to this announcement.  NASA will be under no obligation to proceed with any PPVs or any other partneringarrangements with regard to the anticipated availability of the underutilized facility atSSC.  In lieu of using a PPV to grant a partner a real property interest through a lease orother instrument, NASA may employ Space Act authorities to allow use of the facility forspecified purposes without granting the user any real property interest. For example, SSCmay take such an approach on a facility operated by SSC for both NASA and non-NASA userson a regular basis.  If NASA determines that the facility is going to become idle with no known current orfuture NASA mission support requirement, but still of value in support of NASA's purposeand national space policy if used by others, NASA may decide to divest the agency of theasset by transfer to another federal agency, or to others through established realproperty disposition processes administered by the General Services Administration (GSA). BACKGROUND:As directed by Congress, The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 directs that NASA proceedwith development of a new Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle and Space Launch System that canaccess cislunar space and the regions of space beyond low-Earth orbit.	NASA is challenged as a key element of this transition to re-scope its infrastructure andfacilities footprint to most efficiently support the missions within expected fundinglevels. SSC capabilities and assets that will become idle or underutilized for near-termNASA requirements may be re-purposed and used by the commercial space industry and othersin direct support of NASA's mission and purpose.  SSC seeks to strategically identify, develop and align the Center's distinctive spacetransportation assets and capabilities with other government and commercial spacemarkets. SSC seeks to expand partnerships, customer base and regional economicopportunities consistent with the NASA mission. SSC wishes to promote and enable thewidest and fullest utilization of SSC assets and facilities to advance the nation's goalsfor space exploration and development. These efforts are targeted to accelerateinnovation and collaboration in support of new technologies which are applicable to spaceexploration, as well as to benefit humankind here on Earth where the capabilities will beavailable to both the commercial and government space services industry.  PRIORITY USES FOR AVAILABLE FACILITIES:For the facility identified in this announcement, NASA intends to give priorityconsideration to prospective uses and users which align with the following:* Entities which operate or directly support the advancement of space exploration for theU.S. Government at Stennis Space Center;* Entities which operate or directly support commercial space launch or commercial spaceuser missions, whether or not the U.S. Government is a customer. NASA will consider othertechnical, operationally compatible uses and users which are determined to directly orindirectly support its missions and purposes if underutilized capacity remains available;or  * Entities which directly provide services (e.g., education, insight, access to capital,business development, and related efforts) to entrepreneurs and small businesses thatenable and accelerate the growth of emerging technology companies related to theadvancement of space exploration.  USES THAT NASA WILL NOT CONSIDER:For the facility identified in this announcement that may be available for potential PPVsor other partnering arrangements, NASA will not at this time consider responses that:  * Fail to show any relevance to NASA's mission or purpose and U.S. Government interests,or fail to demonstrate a need for use of the requested SSC asset that cannot be met moreappropriately at other locations outside the restricted area or off Center;* Are deemed incompatible with the current SSC Master Plan, land use policies,environmental conditions, or pose a negative impact on NASA's mission; or* Request any proposed transfer of title to land, proposed residential uses, or proposedoperation of commercial agricultural uses.GOVERNMENT'S RIGHT TO APPLY CRITERIA:NASA reserves the right to apply criteria for assessing the "best fit" for alternativeuses and users which may be considered for the facility identified in this announcement.Such criteria may include, but not be limited to:  * The extent of alignment with NASA's mission, purpose and the long-term developmentobjectives and plans for SSC;  * Benefits to SSC, NASA and other U.S. Government interests;  * The alignment of the proposed use and occupancy need dates with the facility's intendedpurpose, configuration and availability dates;	* An assessment of the financial capability of the proposed user;  * An assessment of the environmental, safety and security impacts of the proposed user;  * Potential for, and degree of, expected positive contribution to sustainment of SSC'stechnical workforce; or * Risks to SSC, NASA and other U.S. Government interests.  GOVERNMENT'S RIGHT TO DISPOSE OF FACILITIES:This announcement does not preclude the Government's option to dispose of the identifiedfacility should it determine that there is no current or future need related to a NASAmission or purpose, and that it is in the Government's best interest to dispose of thefacility rather than to retain it. Such disposal may include, but not be limited to:  * Declaring facility improvements excess to the Government's needs and disposing inaccordance with the established processes of the General Services Administration (GSA);  * Deconstruction of the facility to enable re-development of the site at some futuredate;  or* Abandonment in place.  IDENTIFICATION OF FACILITY ANTICIPATED FOR AVAILABILITY:This notice encompasses only the facility as described below, which is located within thesecured and restricted-access area of SSC, generally referred to as "inside the fence."  SSC E-4 Test Facility:	Originally conceived and designed to conduct ground tests ofpropulsion systems in support of NASAs Rocket Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) Program, theE-4 Test Facility was partially constructed but, to this date, has not been completed andfurther development is not planned at this time.  The basic test facility capability wasdesigned to provide low-pressure hydrocarbon fuel (JP-7) and oxidizer (Liquid Oxygen orLOX) to test articles having a thrust in the horizontal plane up to 50,000 lbf (maximum).NASA envisioned the growth of test capabilities at the E-4 Test Facility to meet futureRBCC or other propulsion testing requirements, including the following possibilities:1)	-the incorporation of Liquid Hydrogen (LH) as a possible fuel, and HydrogenPeroxide (H2O2) as an oxidizer to support testing of power packs and engine systems;2)	the addition of a Ram Air test capability up to Mach Number 0.8 to supportengine systems testing; and3)	the upgrading of the necessary propellant and structural elements of the testfacility in order to support the testing of power packs and engine systems up to 500,000lbf thrust (maximum).No propellant systems, tankage or storage vessels were ever purchased or installed at theE-4 Test Facility.  The E-4 Test Facility consists of concrete-walled test cells and associated hard stand; ahigh-bay work area equipped with a bridge crane and adjacent work area; control roomspace; and personnel offices.  The attached photographs represent each of the types ofspace which make up the E-4 Test Facility.  Access to the E-4 Test Facility is providedby road and, due to close proximity to the onsite canal system, access by barge is alsopossible.  Standard utilities are available in the building, which houses the highbay/work area, control room space and personnel offices.

<DESC>Research and Development Sources Sought<br><br>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) Huntsville, AL intends to award a sole source follow-on contract for operations and maintenance (O&M) support for the ongoing and in-progress effort of support for the particulate radionuclide detectors located in the following eleven (11) locations worldwide:  Sacramento, CA, Sand Point, AK, Melbourne, FL, Palmer Station, Antarctica, Ashland, KS, Charlottesville, VA, Salchaket, AK (Eielson AFB), Wake Island, Sand Island (Midway Island), Oahu, HI, and Upi, Guam.  Furthermore, the following four US International Monitoring System (IMS) Radionuclide stations are required to have noble gas monitoring systems co-located with them:  Charlottesville, VA, Ashland, KS, Oahu, HI, and Wake Island.  Successful worldwide verification of nuclear weapons testing requires that nuclear explosion monitoring (NEM) system must have not only the capability to detect and quantify the nuclear explosion products, but also the ruggedness and ease of use to operate reliably with minimum demands for operator support and maintenance in these diverse locations.  This IS NOT a formal solicitation or a request for proposal or offer.  The government intends to negotiate, on a sole-source basis, with General Dynamics, Rosslyn, Virginia, to fulfill this requirement.  This synopsis is issued to determine if other interest exists within industry.  Currently, the government has not acquired a technical data package (TDP) for this effort.  Notwithstanding the absence of a TDP, contractors who believe they can provide USASMDC/ARSTRAT in Huntsville, AL with the above services, are invited to submit in writing, an affirmative response which includes, as a minimum, the following four (4) items:  the capability to perform the work, evidence of relevant past work experience, any applicable pricing data, and any information indicating a bona fide ability to meet this specific requirement.  All responsible sources may respond to this synopsis and all such responses will be considered by the agency.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Responses should be submitted via email to Dianne Trimble, Dianne.trimble@smdc.army.mil AND Daniel Detrick, Daniel.detrick@smdc.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the publication date of this synopsis.   A page limitation of 10 pages or less is required.

<DESC><p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 102%; MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 102%; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), National Agricultural Library (NAL) intends to award a contract to the American Society of Agronomy (ASA), Crop Science Society of America (CSSA) and Soil Science Society of America (SSSA), in Fitchburg, WI, to provide electronic access via the internet for all USDA users for selected ASA-CSSA-SSSA journals. The three societies share a journal publication program. NAL requires electronic access via the internet to ASA-CSSA-SSSA journals for use by all USDA employees, authorized public on-site users cooperators and volunteers working on behalf of USDA and acting within the scope of their relationship with USDA. Access should include perpetual data rights to the content that is made available to USDA during the performance period. The contractor shall provide, upon termination of the contract and upon a request from USDA, all subscribed-to purchased content in a mutually agreed-upon non-proprietary format. The National Agricultural Library (NAL) is mandated (7 U.S.C. 3101) to serve as the primary agricultural information resource of the United States. One of its functions in that role is the acquisition of information in all aspects of agriculture and allied sciences. In support of this function, the NAL acquires journal publications in electronic format from publishers and makes the journals accessible to USDA employees and library patrons via the internet. In keeping with its charge to collect agricultural and related information, it seeks to maintain a collection of publications in various formats from a variety of publishers and sources. There is no source but the ASA-CSSA-SSSA for the electronic content of the subscribed publications. ASA-CSSA-SSSA does not offer the perpetual rights to any other company for resale, nor does the ASA-CSSA-SSSA sell the full content of its electronic publications to others for resale. The ASA-CSSA-SSSA offers its electronic publications from their website via IP recognition, or in a deliverable electronic format and medium that may be loaded elsewhere. Resellers of ASA-CSSA-SSSA publications are available, but none offers the perpetual rights to the publications. Only the ASA-CSSA-SSSA is capable of supplying the previously subscribed content in an electronic format and medium that would be suitable for loading on NAL's servers, and only the ASA-CSSA-SSSA can supply new content in that electronic format and medium as it is published.<br /><br />Anticipated Date of Award: 11/18/2011</span></p>

<p><br />The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Southern Regional Research Center (SRRC) intends to issue and award to the Gary G. Wells &amp; Associates, Greenville, SC on a sole source basis.

<p>General:<br />The Southern Regional Research Center (SRRC) performs research and investigations on cotton fiber and products, nonwoven fabrics, commodity products, Formosan subterranean termites, and food and feed safety-both fundamental and applied research. Many CCU and externally supported research programs include investigations of fiber products and properties using nonwoven web forming and bonding equipment. In order to prepare the fiber for presentation to the web forming and nonwoven bonding equipment the fiber must first be opened and properly cleaned. The opening and cleaning process requires specialized equipment to complete this function without damaging or loosing excessive amounts of fiber. There are times when two or more fibers need to be used and the opening and cleaning lines will allow us to produce the fiber blends for presentation to the web forming and bonding equipment. With the opening and blending equipment there is no way to properly present the fiber to the nonwoven web forming and bonding equipment that already exists at SRRC- CCU.</p>
<p>Equipment Specifications:<br />&bull; The purchase is for the exact used equipment described and guaranteed to be in good running order. <br />&bull; One Volumetric hopper Model 6012-V without extended apron with 1HP apron motor and 1 HP comber/doffer motor both 208 V.<br />&bull; One two roll Hollingsworth WRZ Opener/Cleaner 1250mm working width.<br />&bull; One Pneumatic Fiber Controls D106 Distributor, 36 inch working width and 1HP 208V motor.<br />&bull; One custom made control panel built to control the above equipment along with our existing Fiber Control 310 fine opener and the 10 HP filter house motor. Also to control the photo cell in the 310 hopper to start and stop the hopper feed.</p>
<p>Service/Support Specifications:</p>
<p>The Gary G. Wells &amp; Associates shall deliver the above mentioned items to the USDA, ARS, SRRC, New Orleans, Louisiana. <br /><br />Responses are to be received within 15 days (12:00 pm CST, November 23, 2011) of this notice.

<DESC>The 10th Contracting Squadron, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado intends to make an emergency sole source award to Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation. USAFA has a requirement for a specific fresh graft fit a specific patient. The tissue has to be a medial femoral chandylar graft that is fresh with live cells to allow regeneration and tissue growth. The graft must be fresh and cannot be frozen. Freezing the tissue kills the chondrocystes needed to promote growth. This procedure is a tissue transplant procedure requiring the graft/tissue to be fresh from a donor. Usually this means that the donor recently passed away, allowing this tissue to become available for recipients. In this case this patient has been waiting for 3 months for a graft fit specifically for them. This company is the only one at this time that carries this fresh medial femoral chondylar tissue, in the exact size needed for this patient. This acquisition will be done in accordance with FAR 12 and 13 procedures. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 621991, Blood and Organ Banks, and the size standard is $10M. This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. DO NOT submit a bid/quote at this time. Due to time contraints in receiving the graft, offers will not be accepted for this acquisition. Offeror&rsquo;s who can provide this service are encouraged to and may provide information for future acquisitions.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley researchers have developed an extensive technology portfolio on novelmethods for effective dispersion of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in polymers. The technologyportfolio extends from making stable dispersions of CNTs in polymer resins to processesfor making composite CNT/polymer films and articles. The technologies apply to a range ofpolymer types, enable low or high CNT loadings as needed, and can be used with a varietyof standard polymer processing methods, including melt processing.  Currently, thetechnology is being used commercially for electrically conductive polymer films forcomponents in electronic printers and copiers.	The technology portfolio spans several methods for dispersion and processing of CNTs inpolymer resins and composites. CNT/resin systems with high dispersion and long-termstability are provided by three general approaches. One method relies on mechanicaldispersion by sonication simultaneous with partial polymerization to increase the resinviscosity to maintain dispersion and enable further polymer processing of the CNT blendinto films and other articles. Another approach relies on what is termed donor acceptorbonding, which essentially is a dipole bond created on the CNT/resin interface tomaintain dispersion and stability of the CNT/resin blend. This dispersion method alsoprovides advantages in mechanical properties of processed composites due to the interfacecharacteristics. A range of polymer types can be used, including polymethyl methacrylate,polyimide, polyethylene, and others. An additional dry blending approach provides advantages for a variety of thermoplasticand thermoset systems. Use of ball mill mixing achieves effective blending and dispersionof the CNT, even at high loadings. Further processing steps using injection molding orsimilar melt processing methods have yielded CNT/polymer composites with a range ofuseful electronic, optical, and mechanical properties.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan at: NASA LangleyResearch Center, 17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<DESC>The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission intends to award a non-competitive contract to Halden Institutt for Energiteknikk for work supporting the need to update human factor review guidelines and develop supplementary guidance and technical basis documents for the review of new and advanced control room designs. This project is entitled, "Development of scenarios for Integrated System Validation to update NUREG-0711 guidance". The period of performance is 15 months. <br /><br />The objective of this work is to provide enhanced guidance on the development of scenarios for Integrated System Validation (ISV). NUREG-0711 currently does not address the development of the scenarios for ISV with respect to how the operational conditions should be combined, how many scenarios should be performed, or on the determination of acceptance criteria in the scenarios. <br /><br />The results of the research will inform the reviewers on the characteristics of scenarios that should be considered as the basis for selection of acceptance criteria, how operational conditions should be combined (including the number of operational conditions that may be contained in a single scenario and the number of scenarios that may be included in a reasonable sample). In addition, the results will be used to create one or more &lsquo;generic' example ISV scenarios that will be used to illustrate to reviewers what information should be contained in the set of scenarios. These examples will demonstrate how the methods and metrics used in ISV are separate from the definition of the scenarios, while demonstrating that the characteristics of the scenarios are critical in the selection of the human performance measures. The results of this research will be used to update the guidance contained in NUREG-0711 section 11, Human Factors Verification and Validation. The outcome of this work should be a process to help select operational conditions, scenarios and measures for ISV. Attached is the proposed statement of work for this action.<br /><br />This notice of intent is neither a request for quotation nor a solicitation of offers. Interested respondents must submit a written capability statement, including technical information sufficient to demonstrate a bona fide written capability to meet this requirement, to the point of contact of this posting no later than 45 calendar days from the date announcement appears in the Federal Business Opportunities. Telephonic, email and responses providing insufficient information for evaluation by the NRC will not be considered. If no response is received within 45 calendar days award will be made to the entity mentioned above.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item(s)/services:<br />CLIN 0001 Provide design, fabrication and installation of 10 outdoor digital high pressure laminate (DHPL) interpretive signs measuring 36 inch wide by 24 inch tall and &frac12; inch thick for the Torch Oil/Platform Irene Oil Spill Natural Resources Trustee Council Rocky Intertidal Habitat Protection Program. The outdoor signs shall be installed at outdoor settings at entrances to rocky intertidal beaches in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties. The remaining five signs and bases/mounting hardware are to be delivered to a location in Santa Barbara County.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:<br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br />Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary<br />Rocky Intertidal Interpretive Signs and Graphic Panel Design and Fabrication</p>
<p>Contractor Responsibility<br />The contractor is responsible for design and fabrication of ten (10) outdoor interpretive signs. The signs will be 36" wide by 24" tall and &frac12; inch thick with rounded corners and fabricated from digital high pressure laminate (DHPL) material and shall have a 10 year warranty.</p>
<p>Five of the ten signs will be fully installed by June 30, 2012 in outdoor settings at entrances to rocky intertidal beaches in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties (approximate coordinates below). The remaining five signs and bases/mounting hardware are to be delivered to a location in Santa Barbara County.</p>
<p>Background<br />The Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary is leading the implementation of the Torch Oil/Platform Irene Oil Spill Natural Resources Trustee Council Rocky Intertidal Habitat Protection Program ("program"). The goals of the program are to provide local community outreach and education regarding the sensitivities of rocky intertidal habitats and to reduce the impacts from human disturbance on tide pools. Tide pools and other components of rocky intertidal shores represent a species-rich habitat which attracts a wide array of visitors and collectors. Human disturbance of tide pool areas is of concern and includes trampling of the resources, turnover of rocks, displacement of both living and non-living resources, and collecting of intertidal species or shells that can provide habitat. In addition to direct losses from trampling and collecting, secondary changes may result from changes in distribution, prey availability and competition. Under heavy use, patches of habitat become more frequently disturbed, allowing less time for recovery. <br />Program components include the design, fabrication and installation of interpretive signage and exhibit panels about rocky intertidal habitats. The interpretive signs will be located at various public locations such as overlooks, beaches and other popular ocean-view sites that are managed by federal, state or private partners. The interpretive signs will provide information to the public about natural history information about black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii) and their adaptations to surviving in the rocky intertidal zone. They also will interpret the importance of protecting black abalone, current research underway to understand threats to their survival and ocean etiquette techniques to minimize impacts to remaining populations. The primary audience will be the Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo County communities and visitors to the area's beaches. <br />Objectives<br />The contractor will be responsible for working with staff from the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and the Torch Oil Spill Rocky Intertidal Education Outreach Project Coordinator ("CINMS staff and Project Coordinator") to coordinate, design and fabricate interpretive signage, and to install signage in five (5) locations that are managed by a number of state, county and local partners.<br />The contractor will develop a systematic approach to rocky intertidal interpretive signage and use a list of common themes and messages. Each sign will have a common look and feel, yet it will need to be adaptable to the needs of the partners. Interactions with partners will be unified and baseline standards will be used.</p>
<p>Statement of Work<br />1. Development of a timeline for signage development, review, fabrication and installation.

The contractor shall be responsible for developing a design that incorporates the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries graphic standards and the standards required by the partners involved. The signs may differ by location depending on logos and standards of regional partners, but overall content (graphics/text) will remain the same.<br />3. Fabrication of signage. Ten (10) signs with the dimensions of 36" wide by 24" tall will be made from DHPL, &frac12; inch in thickness, with rounded edges. Eight (8) bases will be powder coated aluminum double leg low profile models with backing panel (KVO Slimline or similar). These bases will include 2 posts and a backing panel for each sign. Two (2) of the signs will be rail mounted and will require appropriate mounting hardware.</p>
<p>4. Exhibit installation/set-up. Subsequent to the fabrication of the signs, the contractor shall work with CINMS staff, Project Coordinator and partners to install five (5) signs.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.

With his/her quote the Contractor shall provide the necessary welding certifications and qualifications as required by the specification for the applicable work item(s), and SFLC Standard Specification 0740_STD. MAY BE CONSIDERED INCOMPLETE AND MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED QUOTES MUST INCLUDE ALL DOCUMENTS REQUESTED IN THIS SOLICITATION (WELDING CERTIFICATES, DRYDOCK CERTIFICATION, PAST PERFORMANCE, ETC). QUOTES THAT DO NOT INCLUDE ALL DOCUMENTS REQUESTED GROWTH WORK (a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated. (b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal. (c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC. COMPOSITE LABOR RATE: -The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract. (a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following: (1) direct labor wages and salaries;(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies; (6) profit (fee); and(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions: Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating; Material Handling Housekeeping; Engineering Transportation/Drivers; Quality Assurance Contract Administration; Security Testing (b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated. (c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time-consuming litigation. Potential quoters who believe that a Coast Guard solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the quoter should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the address below: Commandant (CG-9131),United States Coast Guard Headquarters, Procurement Planning & Oversight Division, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0203,Washington, DC 20593-0001,Telephone: (202) 372-3695, Fax: (202) 475-3904 Potential quoters should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: Solicitation number, Contracting Office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date.

MCAGCC Access/Security Requirements-Contractor and Contractor-Employee Access Conditions:   

1.  Access Procedures Are Mandatory:  All contractor employees are required to obtain business access or permanent business access.  Daily access procedures must not be used to circumvent background check requirements outlined below.  Attempts to improperly use daily access procedures may result in denial of access to the involved employees. 

2.   Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year.
  Submit the following:  

	A valid form of Federal or state government I.D.
	If driving a motor vehicle, a valid driver's license, vehicle registration and proof
	of insurance.
	Proof of employment on a valid Government contract (e.g., a letter from the
	prime contractor including contract number and term).
	Proof of an employee background check conducted within the past year
	covering the previous two years.  Contractor employee background checks are
	conducted at contractor expense.  The background check:

(a)	must establish the employee's citizenship or legal alien status.  Acceptable documents include birth certificate, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) forms and passports.
(b)	must include proof of a criminal records check from the county or state where the employee resided for the previous two years (or length of legal residence for foreign nationals in the U.S.
 for less than two years).  
(c)	will be subject to Government verification via the FBI National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Interstate Identification Index (III).  If the background check is selected for  verification, the employee will be required to submit fingerprint records to the FBI Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) database.  NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed at
Government expense.

Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshals Office (PMO)  of the Combat Center.  For the MCAGCC/MAGTFTC, this process includes the completion of a COMBAT CENTER ACCESS AUTHORITY letter issued by the Regional Contracting Office (NW).
  

3.  Permanent Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one to three years.  Submit all items listed above under business access.  NCIC check and fingerprint of all contractor employees will be conducted at Government expense.  Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractors expense.

4.  Emergency Access:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities.
  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  

5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  

6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.
  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee:
	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List.
	b.    is illegally present in the United States.
c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant.
d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information.
	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations.

8.  Employee Compliance.  The Contractors employees shall observe and comply with all MCAGCC/MAGTFTC rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract. Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel.

9.
  Contract Termination:  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to negotiate and award a sole-source, multiple contract type ID/IQ contract to Northrop Grumman, Navigation Systems Division (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman Electronics Systems), Woodland Hills, California for non-personal services for post-production life cycle management support for the AN/TYQ-23(V)4 Tactical Air Operations Module (TAOM), AN/TYQ-87(V)2 Sector Anti-Air Warfare Facility (SAAWF), the TAOM Interface Group (TIG), the Multi-Channel Interface Unit (MCIU), and critical components of the AN/TSQ-269 Mobile TAOM (MTAOM).
The AN/TYQ-23(V)4 TAOM is a transportable, modularized, automated command and control element that, in conjunction with the SAAWF and peripheral equipment, provides automatic acquisition, identification and tracking of all aircraft, Air Breathing Targets (ABT) and Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBM) and directs air defense for its area of responsibility (AOR).
 The TAOM was manufactured by Northrop Grumman (formerly Litton) under contract N00039-87-C-0330, upgraded to the (V)4 configuration under contract M67854-98-C-2111, refreshed, along with the SAAWF, TIU, and MCIU under contract M67854-02-D-2000 and is currently being sustained under contract M67854-07-D-2060. The post-production life-cycle support includes Program Management, Configuration Management, Engineering Services Support, and Logistics Management Support. The support will include development of a Life Cycle Management and Support Plan which will define the management and systems engineering processes and methodologies that will be employed to provide on-going life cycle support the for AN/TYQ-23(V)4 and related systems throughout their remaining life cycles, including Diminishing Manufacturing Resources (DMS) and Parts Obsolescence.
Configuration management will encompass the functions of Configuration Identification, Configuration Control, Configuration Audits, and Configuration Status Accounting.
 An Engineering Services CLIN will be included to provide for efforts such as continued improvements to the TAOM, to include interfaces to other systems/equipment within the Marine Air Command and Control family of systems (FoS), legacy system migration, Tactical Data Link (TDL) and communications capability enhancements, implementation of Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capabilities, refinement of CTN capability, G/ATOR integration, ENTR integration, implementation and refinement of remote radar capability, implementation of Mode V/S and ADS-B  IFF capabilities, Information Assurance support, and technology insertion and capability enhancements. These Engineering Services will consist of engineering studies and analyses, engineering change proposal (ECP) development, design change notices (DCN), development of modification kits and associated testing and technical support.
 
Northrop Grumman possesses unique and proprietary knowledge of the engineering and design of these systems and subsystems and is considered the only source capable of meeting this requirement. The contract will be for the period of one year with four option years. No RFP is available for competitive bidding; however, interested parties are encouraged to submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement. No telephonic requests will be accepted. All communications shall be in writing to the points of contact listed in this announcement; reference synopsis number M67854-12-R-2412.  Proprietary information shall be clearly identified as such and will be protected. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.
 Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 0001 to Solicitation W25G1V-12-R-0007 is to answer offerors' questions.<br><br>1) Offerors' questions received with Government response:<br><br>Q1) What is the density the end-user is looking for in the foam? The drawings do not specify. <br><br>A1)  The foam density and/or type will be determined by the vendor in order to meet the requirements of MIL-STD-810.  The foam itself doesn't need to meet the MIL-STD, but the density should be chosen so that it protects the stored components from damage in accordance with test the methods described in MIL-STD-810 for shock, vibration, moisture etc.<br><br>Q2) The foam insert does not specify a specific type of polyethylene foam.  Is there a specific rate / class for this application?  <br><br>A2)  See A1.<br><br>Q3) There looks to be a re-enforced section for the insert in the drawing.  Does this part/piece need to be constructed of a rigid foam or can this be a hardened plastic or wood based item? <br><br>A3)  Current transit cases have a hard plastic base as part of -12, Foam, Top.  Base should be made of material of sufficient rigidity to prevent fully populated -12 Foam, Top from deforming when handled.  Approximate weight of stowed items 15 lb.<br><br>Q4) What is the color of the foam used in the transit cases? <br><br>A4)  Foam should be black or gray. <br><br>Q5)  Is there a specific case brand required to be used?<br><br>A5)  The case shall be selected by prospective supplier so as to meet the requirements of the drawing.<br><br>Q6)  Is there a specific density to the foam required?<br><br>A6)  The foam density and/or type will be determined by the vendor in order to comply with the requirements of MIL-STD-810.<br><br>Q7)  Do you wish for the foam insert to be glued into the case?<br><br>A7)  Yes, -11, Foam, Bottom and -13, Foam, Lid must be glued into the case.<br><br>Q8)  Are the case cartons required in the delivery, or can the cases be palatalized and wrapped in plastic?<br>	<br>A8)  Cartons are not a requirement.  Transit cases should be protected from damage in shipment.<br><br>Q9)  What ratio would you like the convoluted foam for the lid?<br>	<br>A9)  See A6.<br><br>Q10)  When is expected first delivery window?  This is important since many vendors will increase prices 1/1/12.<br>	<br>A10)  Within 30 days of contract award.<br><br>Q11)  In regards to Drawing 176658 - dimensions are listed as approximate.  Is it allowable to go shorter on any of the dimensions?  Is a case that is 24" in width, 18" in depth, and 12" in height acceptable?<br><br>A11)  No.  Case dimensions are determined by the configuration of items stored inside.  Refer to overall dimensions of -11 Foam, Bottom, -12 Foam, Top, and -13 Foam, Lid.  Length dimension of each of these three components is 29.6 inches.  <br><br>Q12) The drawing detailing component # 13 (Foam, Lid - please see drawing<br>176658 REV A, page 7) denotes that this component may optionally be manufactured using "Layered Foam". Only component # 13 (Foam, Lid) has notes allowing for fabrication using the "Layered Foam" technique.  Is it correct to assume that all components may be manufactured using the "Layered Foam" technique? <br><br>A12)  Layered construction is acceptable for all three large sections, -11, -12, and -13.  Amount of layers should be kept to a minimum.  All layers must be securely bonded together.<br><br>Q13) The drawing detailing component # 12 (Foam, Top - please see drawing<br>176658 REV A, page 5) indicates that the foam assembly has a 0.25 inch "reinforced base". Please provide a more detailed directive regarding which materials are considered acceptable for the 0.25 inch reinforced base.<br><br>A13)  Current transit cases have a hard plastic base as part of -12, Foam, Top.  Base should be made of material of sufficient rigidity to prevent fully-populated -12 Foam, Top from deforming when removed from transit case.  Approximate weight of stowed items is 15 lb.<br><br>Q14) Would cases that that match the inside dimensions so the inserts would fit, but are smaller than the external dimensions on the print, be acceptable? <br><br>A14)  The inside dimensions are the driving dimensions.  If they are sufficient to fit the specified foam as shown on sheets 4 through 7 of drawing 176658, then a case with smaller external dimensions will be acceptable provided the proposed case has all of the required features - wheels, carry handles, pull handle, etc. as shown on the drawing.<br><br>Q15) What is the required color of the case? <br><br>A15)  Black.<br><br>Q16) Please provide any indication as to the weight rating of the foam (usually, specs in pounds, which refers to the weight required to compress a block of the foam by an inch).<br><br>A16)  The foam density and/or type will be determined by the vendor in order to meet the requirements of MIL-STD-810.<br><br>Q17) Are the foam fabricated products previously supplied manufactured and verified to the +/- tolerance of 0.01 inches (less than 1/64 inch) - the assigned tolerance for the two decimal dimensions noted in the drawing package? <br><br>A17)  Two-decimal-place dimensions have a tolerance of +/- .03.  See tolerance block, area A3, on drawing 176658, sheet 1.  Unless I missed them, I do not see any 3-place dimensions on the drawing which would require a tolerance of +/- .010.<br><br>Q18) Reference Drawing # 176658, sheet 5 of 8 section C1 (B-B) - 12 Foam, Top. The Section B-B portion calls for a .25" Reinforced Base. Is this base material to be polyethylene foam as well? If not, what is the material?<br><br>A18)  Current transit cases have a hard plastic base as part of -12, Foam, Top.  Base should be made of material of sufficient rigidity to prevent fully-populated -12 Foam, Top from deforming when removed from transit case.  Approximate weight of stowed items is 15 lb.<br><br><br>All other terms and conditions remain the same.

A Final Report from current Phase I efforts will be made available by April 2012.<br><br> b.	https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=29291972976d53a52d2b6a9392f0ab20&tab=core&_cview=0<br><br> c.	The Phase I awards are technology investment agreements (TIAs), so each work effort is tailored to the recipient's technology effort.  Consequently, a readily releasable version is not available for industry.<br><br> d.	The period of performance for AVMS Phase I runs through February 2012.<br><br> e.	The Boeing Company and Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation.<br><br>Question 2:  Per the subject BAA which states "AATD is soliciting technical & cost proposals to conduct a 6.3 Demonstration Validation Research effort in support of Phase II of the AVMS".  Per definition of R & D (DOD Unique), Advanced Technology Development is 6.3 and Demonstration & Validation is 6.4.  Please clarify. <br><br>Response 2:  The solicitation has been amended to reflect 6.3 Advanced Technology Development (develop and integrate technologies at system & subsystem level, demonstrate technology capabilities and define transition paths to the Warfighter). <br><br>Question 3:  Is it possible to obtain a list of the winners and POCs from the Phase I award of this program? <br><br>Response 3:  Phase I was awarded to the following companies: The Boeing Company (Contract number W911W6-10-2-0002) and Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Contract number W911W6-10-2-0004). <br><br>Question 4:  I am trying to get a better feel for how connected Phase II is to the Phase I studies.  Since we did not participate in the Phase I studies, we are not familiar with the technologies that were recommended from that study.  Is the Army looking to only to simulate and flight test technologies picked from Phase 1 studies?<br><br>Response 4:  As stated in the BAA, Ph II is not tied to PH I studies.  The Phase I effort investigated a system approach to the VMS concept.  During Phase I, the Government sought to evaluate the benefit of the system approach to the VMS concept. The Government's estimation is that any entity working on a system approach to the VMS concept for a vehicle should find similar results.  The Government seeks in PH II to validate the system approach as a more efficient/effective approach (or not) in improving vehicles design and capabilities.  The portion of the demonstrations that implement multiple technologies, some new, is part of the Government's desired method for concept validation.  The AVMS Program is targeted to next generation VMS of manned/unmanned/optionally manned systems.  Implementation of technologies (some new) is a method of demonstrating and validating of the system approach, not the demonstration and validating the technologies themselves.<br>

The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. <br />(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<DESC>Amendment 2-<br /><br />GSA Form L201B is amended to include the following as Section 7.10<br /><br />
<p>7.10 REAL ESTATE TAX ADJUSTMENT (AUG 2011)</p>
<p>A. Purpose: This paragraph provides for adjustment in the rent ("tax adjustment") to account for increases or decreases in real estate taxes for the Property after the establishment of the real estate tax base, as those terms are defined herein. Tax adjustments shall be calculated in accordance with this Clause.</p>
<p>B. Definitions: The following definitions apply to the use of the terms within this paragraph:</p>
<p>1. "Property" is defined as the land and buildings in which the Premises are located, including all appurtenant areas (e.g., parking areas to which the Government is granted rights).</p>
<p>2."Real estate taxes" are those taxes that are levied upon the owners of real property by a taxing authority (as hereinafter defined) of a State or local Government on an ad valorem basis to raise general revenue for funding the provision of government services. The term excludes, without limitation, special assessments for specific purposes, assessments for business improvement districts, and/or community development assessments.</p>
<p>3. "Taxing authority" is a state, commonwealth, territory, county, city, parish, or political subdivision thereof, authorized by law to levy, assess, and collect real estate taxes.</p>
<p>4. "Tax year" refers to the 12-month period adopted by a taxing authority as its fiscal year for assessing real estate taxes on an annual basis.</p>
<p>5. "Tax abatement" is an authorized reduction in the Lessor's liability for real estate taxes below that determined by apply&not;ing the generally applicable real estate tax rate to the Fully Assessed (as hereinafter defined) valuation of the Property.</p>
<p>6. "Unadjusted real estate taxes" are the full amount of real estate taxes that would be assessed for the Property for one full tax year without regard to the Lessor's entitlement to any tax abatements (except if such tax abatement came into effect after the date of award of the Lease), and not including any late charges, interest or penalties. If a tax abatement comes into effect after the date of award of the Lease, "unadjusted real estate taxes" are the full amount of real estate taxes assessed for the Property for one full tax year, less the amount of such tax abatement, and not including any late charges, interest, or penalties.</p>
<p>7. "Real estate tax base" is the Unadjusted real estate taxes for the first full tax year following the commencement of the Lease term. If the real estate taxes for that tax year are not based upon a Full Assessment of the Property, then the real estate tax base shall be the Unadjusted real estate taxes for the Property for the first full tax year for which the real estate taxes are based upon a Full Assessment. Such first full tax year may be hereinafter referred to as the "tax base year." Alternatively, the real estate tax base may be an amount negotiated by the parties that reflects an agreed upon base for a Fully Assessed value of the property.</p>
<p>8. The Property is deemed to be "Fully Assessed" (and real estate taxes are deemed to be based on a "Full Assessment") only when a taxing authority has, for the purpose of determining the Lessor's liability for real estate taxes, determined a value for the Property taking into account the value of all improvements contemplated for the Property pursuant to the Lease, and issued to the Lessor a tax bill or other notice of levy wherein the real estate taxes for the full tax year are based upon such Full Assessment. At no time prior to the issuance of such a bill or notice shall the Property be deemed Fully Assessed.</p>
<p>9. "Percentage of Occupancy" refers to that portion of the Property exclusively occupied or used by the Government pur&not;suant to the Lease. For buildings, the Percentage of Occupancy is determined by calculating the ratio of the Rentable Square Feet occupied by the Govern&not;ment pursuant to the Lease to the total RSF in the Building or Buildings so occupied, and shall not take into account the Government's ancillary rights including, but not limited to, parking or roof space for antennas (unless facilities for such ancillary rights are separately assessed). This percentage shall be subject to adjustment to take into account increases or decreases for space leased by the Government or for rentable space on the Property.</p>
<p>C. Adjustment for changes in real estate taxes. After the Property is Fully Assessed, the Government shall pay its share of any increases and shall receive its share of any decreases in the real estate taxes for the Property, such share of increases or decreases to be referred to herein as "tax adjustment." The amount of the tax adjustment shall be determined by multiplying the Government's Percentage of Occupancy by the difference between the current year Unadjusted real estate taxes and the real estate tax base, less the portion of such difference not paid due to a tax abatement (except if a tax abatement comes into effect after the date of award of the Lease). If a tax abatement comes into effect after the date of award of the Lease, the amount of the tax adjustment shall be determined by multiplying the Government's Percentage of Occupancy by the difference between the current year Unadjusted real estate taxes and the real estate tax base. The Government shall pay the tax adjustment in a single annual lump sum payment to the Lessor. In the event that this tax adjustment results in a credit owed to the Government, the Government may elect to receive payment in the form of a rental credit or lump sum payment.</p>
<p>1. If the Property contains more than one separately assessed parcel, then more than one tax adjustment shall be deter&not;mined based upon the Percentage of Occupancy, real estate tax base, and real estate taxes for each respective parcel.</p>
<p>2. After commencement of the Lease term, the Lessor shall provide to the LCO copies of all real estate tax bills for the Property, all documentation of tax abatements, credits, or refunds, if any, and all notices which may affect the assessed valuation of the Property, for the tax year prior to the commencement of the Lease Term, and all such documentation for every year following. Lessor acknowledges that the LCO shall rely on the completeness and accuracy of these submissions in order to establish the real estate tax base and to determine tax adjustments. The LCO may memorialize the establishment of the real estate tax base by issuing a unilateral administrative supplemental Lease agreement indicating the base year, the amount of the real estate tax base, and the Government's percentage of occupancy.</p>
<p>3. The real estate tax base is subject to adjustment when increases or decreases to real estate taxes in any tax year are attributable to (a) improvements or renovations to the Property not required by this Lease, or (b) changes in net operating income for the Property not derived from this Lease. If either condition results in a change to the real estate taxes, the LCO may re-establish the real estate tax base as the unadjusted real estate taxes for the tax year the Property is reassessed under such condition, less the amount by which the unadjusted real estate taxes for the tax year prior to reassessment exceeds the prior real estate tax base.</p>
<p>4. If this Lease includes any options to renew the term of the Lease, or be otherwise extended, the real estate tax base for determining tax adjustments during the renewal term or extension shall be the last real estate tax base established during the base term of the Lease.</p>
<p>5.If any real estate taxes for the Property are retroactively reduced by a taxing authority during the term of the Lease, the Government shall be entitled to a proportional share of any tax refunds to which the Lessor is entitled, calculated in accordance with this Clause. Lessor acknowledges that it has an affirmative duty to disclose to the Government any decreases in the real estate taxes paid for the Property during the term of the Lease. Lessor shall annually provide to the LCO all relevant tax records for determining whether a tax adjustment is due, irrespective of whether it seeks an adjustment in any tax year.</p>
<p>6. If the Lease terminates before the end of a tax year, or if rent has been suspended, payment for the real estate tax increase due because of this section for the tax year will be prorated based on the number of days that the Lease and the rent were in effect. Any credit due the Government after the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease shall be made by a lump sum payment to the Government or as a rental credit to any succeeding lease, as determined in the LCO's sole discretion. Lessor shall remit any lump sum payment to the Government within 15 calendar days of payment or credit by the taxing authority to Lessor or Lessor's designee. If the credit due to the Government is not paid by the due date, interest shall accrue on the late payment at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 USC &sect; 611), that is in effect on the day after the due date. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the amount of the credit and shall be compounded in 30 day increments inclusive from the first day after the due date through the payment date. The Government shall have the right to pursue the outstanding balance of any tax credit using all such collection methods as are available to the United States to collect debts. Such collection rights shall survive the expiration of this Lease.</p>
<p>7. In order to obtain a tax adjustment, the Lessor shall furnish the LCO with copies of all paid tax receipts, or other similar evidence of payment acceptable to the LCO, and a proper invoice (as described in GSA Form 3517, General Clauses, 552.232-75, Prompt Payment) for the requested tax adjustment, including the calculation thereof. All such documents must be re-ceived by the LCO within 60 calendar days after the last date the real estate tax payment is due from the Lessor to the taxing authority without payment of penalty or interest. FAILURE TO SUBMIT THE PROPER INVOICE AND EVIDENCE OF PAYMENT WITHIN SUCH TIME FRAME SHALL CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF THE LESSOR'S RIGHT TO RECEIVE A TAX ADJUSTMENT PURSUANT TO THIS CLAUSE FOR THE TAX YEAR AFFECTED.</p>
<p>8. Tax appeals. If the Government occupies more than 50% of the Building by virtue of this and any other Government Lease(s), the Government may, upon reasonable notice, direct the Lessor to initiate a tax appeal, or the Government may elect to contest the assessed valuation on its own behalf or jointly on behalf of Government and the Lessor. If the Government elects to contest the assessed valuation on its own behalf or on behalf of the Government and the Lessor, the Lessor shall cooperate fully with this effort, including, without limitation, furnishing to the Government information necessary to contest the assessed valuation in accordance with the filing requirements of the taxing authority, executing documents, providing documentary and testimonial evidence, and verifying the accuracy and completeness of records. If the Lessor initiates an appeal at the direction of the Government, the Government shall have the right to approve the selection of counsel who shall represent the Lessor with regard to such appeal, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and the Lessor shall be entitled to a credit in the amount of its reasonable expenses in pursuing the appeal.</p>

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract with a 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<AWARDEE>Ad Council, 815 2nd Ave., Floor 9
, New York, NY 10017 US
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
<p>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>Justification <br /><br />1. Contracting Agency and Activity.</p>
<p>Program Office<br />Health and Human Services - Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs<br />200 Independence Ave, SW<br />Room 647D <br />Washington, DC 20201</p>
<p>Contracting Office<br />US Department of the Interior - National Business Center<br />Acquisition Services Directorate<br />381 Elden St, Ste 4000<br />Herndon, VA 20170</p>
<p>2. Nature of Action Being Approved.</p>
<p>This action seeks to establish a firm fixed price purchase order with The Advertising Council (AdCouncil) to provide advertising and marketing support for the project entitled "National Obesity Prevention and Healthy Lifestyle Campaign". The purchase order will include a base year and one twelve month option period.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies or Services.</p>
<p>The vendor will support the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) by providing services to include advertising support, planning, and dissemination of public service announcements specifically directed at obesity prevention utilizing multiple distribution means.</p>
<p>4. Estimated Dollar Value.</p>
<p>Base Period: $2,487,339.00<br />Option Period: $2,576,478.00<br />Total: $5,063,817.00</p>
<p><br />5. Statutory Authority.</p>
<p>FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p><br />6. Rationale Supporting Use of Citation in No. 5.</p>
<p>HHS has a continuing requirement for advertising support for public service advisories relating to the campaign entitled "National Obesity Prevention and Healthy Lifestyle Campaign." This campaign was started under a previous award issued by HHS to the AdCouncil under award number HHSP23320084250EC. This award was made using ARRA funds which have since expired, yet there is a continuing need by HHS to complete this campaign which was not completed under the HHS award. As the AdCouncil is two years into the effort, they have corporate knowledge from the initial work performed. Additionally, they have materials from the previous effort which may still be used on the new contract.</p>
<p>The AdCouncil has unique advantages that other advertising companies can not match. The AdCouncil is a not-for-profit and the largest provider of public service announcements in the US. As the largest provider, the AdCouncil has access to over 33,000 different distribution sources and locations across the US. The majority of commercial advertising agencies do not have this full outreach. Using the AdCouncil provides a significant economic savings to HHS as well. These savings are in the estimated amount of nearly $30 million. These savings are achieved because the AdCouncil receives all of its advertising time in media sources such as television and radio for free. Additionally, nearly all commercial advertising groups that work with the AdCouncil on advertising campaigns donate, on average, more than 2,000 hours of labor per campaign.<br /><br />7. Other Information. Provide any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:</p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p>8. Efforts to Identify Additional Sources.</p>
<p>There are commercial sources for advertising and marketing support in the marketplace, including the GSA Schedule, but they do not have the outreach that the AdCouncil has. Additionally, the AdCouncil does not have a GSA Schedule. When inquiring about competing the requirement on an open market basis, the AdCouncil identified that it probably would not compete as it would be competing against the same companies that it relies upon to donate time and resources to the AdCouncil in all of their campaign efforts.</p>
<p>9. Future Plans to Permit Competition.</p>
<p>At this time, this requirement will not be competed if a continuing need exists after the two years of support is provided. A new determination will be made at that time upon the best method to obtain the services if there is a valid bona-fide-need.</p>
<p><br />10. Market Survey. Describe the market search, including:</p>
<p>Market research has included GSA's eLibrary and discussion with the AdCouncil regarding their not-for-profit activities and the methods used.<br /><br />11. Recommendation and Certification</p>
<p>It is determined to be in the best interest of the Department of the Interior to award a purchase order to The Advertising Council to provide advertising support to HHS.</p>

Authority Cited:  10 U.S. Code 2304(c)(1) per FAR 6.302.1 - Only one responsible source and no others supplies or services will satify agencies requirements. <br><br>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  <br><br>The Government requires the purchase of the UHF Laser Doppler Vibrometer equipment upgrade, Software Bundle, Objective Lenses, Back up Copy of Data Analysis Software, and Comprehensive Upgrade Bundle to provide essential upgrades to an existing Laser Doppler vibrometry system.  The current system supports a wide array of research and development projects, including PiezoMEMS devices for Radio Frequency (RF) systems and mm-scale robotics.  Current research activities in PiezoMEMS are advancing the standard in RF switches and resonators used in tactical radio systems.  The proposed purchase enables evaluations from the 20 MHz to 1 GHz frequency range and  Direct Current (DC) to 80 kHz. <br><br>Polytec, Inc has the proprietary rights for the required upgrades that are compatibe with the Government owned (Laser Doppler Vibrometer) thus they are the only company that can meet the mission need. The equipment upgrades are critical to the Government's on-going R&D efforts of PiezoMEMS technology for both tactical radio systems and mobile unattended sensors.  Without the upgrade to the system the Government's on-going R&D efforts in the area of PiezoMEMS technology will be substantially impeded.  The upgrade is necessary to fully develop high frequency filter technology with MEMS technology. It is crucial to validate theoretical predictions of the mechanical mode shapes as a function of frequency.  Currently, high frequency Laser Doppler vibrometry is the only technique viable at frequencies ranging from the low MHz to low GHz. Polytec, Inc. is the only manufacturer that can provide the vibrometer equipment and upgrades that meet the minimum requirements of the Government, and the company does not have any distributors or resellers of their products. <br><br>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  <br><br>The existing proprietary hardware and software with the Laser Doppler Vibrometer is critical to the Government's on-going R&D of PiezoMEMS technology for both tactical radio systems and mobile unattended sensors. Market research identified and evaluated two (2) manufacturers other than Polytec, Inc. that produce Laser Doppler vibrometry characterization equipment: MetroLaser, Inc. and Sunny Instruments. However, both MetroLaser, Inc. and Sunny Instruments do not produce vibrometers capable of the simultaneous high frequency operation and scanning capabilities required by the Government.  Additionally, both manufacturers' vibrometers have a frequency range of less than 1 MHz, which does not meet the minimum requirement of 1.2 GHz.  <br><br>The proprietary nature of the existing hardware and software makes using another manufacturer impossible. Pursuing another manufacturer would result in a duplication of time as at it would take at least one (1) man-year (approximately $250,000.00) to develop codes and procedures that currently exist for the Laser Doppler Vibrometer, a duplication of costs for royalties that would have to be paid to Polytec, Inc. in order to access its proprietary software and a duplication of cost (approximately $950,000.00) for switching all existing equipment over to another manufacturer. Manufacturers with similar capabilities utilize their own proprietary hardware and software that is incompatible with the existing vibrometry equipment in use at ARL. Polytec, Inc. is the only manufacturer that can provide the vibrometry equipment and upgrades that meet the minimum requirements of the Government.  <br><br>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:<br><br>Polytec, Inc.  is  the OEM and is the only source qualified to provide the Laser Doppler vibrometry characterization equipment and upgrades required by the Government to evaluate the electromechanical response of PiezoMEMS. The Government continually invites other manufacturers on-site to demonstrate their competing products.    If and when a capable source is known, the Government will technically evaluate it against Polytec, Inc. to verify their equipment capabilities.  Should any new source be determined as a qualified competitor,  then the Government will seek to pursue their future Laser Doppler vibrometry characterization equipment and upgrades under full and open competition.   <br><br>8.  Market Research:  <br><br>The Government has been researching this procurement for a period of twelve (12) months. The market research began  in the summer of 2010 and concluded in May 2011. The members of the team conducted market surveys which included: 1) discussions with vendors at conferences such as the Material Research Symposium (01 Dec 2010) and the U.S. Naval Acoustic Transducers Workshop (10 May 2011); 2) surveying published MEMS and high frequency device researchers about how the characterization electromechanical induced vibration/motion and how well the tools perform; 3) conducting internet surveys; 4) using existing Polytec MSV-Z-040 hardware/software at ARL; and 5) discussions with representatives from various optical measurement companies. As noted in Part 6, market research identified and evaluated two (2) manufacturers other than Polytec, Inc. that produce Laser Doppler vibrometry characterization equipment: MetroLaser, Inc. and Sunny Instruments. However, both MetroLaser, Inc. and Sunny Instruments  produce vibrometers  that do not contain the  scanning capabilities required by the Government. Additionally, both manufacturers' non-scanning vibrometers have a frequency range of less than 1 MHz, which does not meet the Government requirement of 1.2 GHz. Furthermore, due to the proprietary nature of the Laser Doppler vibrometry characterization equipment currently in use at ARL, the research team's findings identified no known competitor which can provide the required compatible equipment and the upgrades for the Polytec MSV-Z-040 that meet the minimum requirements of the Government.<br><br>9. Interested Sources:  <br><br>A pre synopsis solicitation notice has been posted  to FedBizOps on 25 August 2011. To date, no other sources have written to express an interest. As required by FAR 5.201, all bids or proposals received shall be considered. <br><br>10.  Other Facts:  <br>a.  Procurement history.   <br>(1) Contract numbers and dates of the last several awards.<br>Laser Doppler Vibrometer was purchased 04/19/2001 under contract # DAAD17-01C-0076 to Polytec, Inc. <br>(2) Competitive status of these actions.<br>The previous action was made as a sole source purchase. <br>(3) Authority previously used for less than full and open competition.<br>FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source<br>(4) If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, a summary of the contents of paragraph 7 of the justification for that procurement and an explanation of the results.<br>The decision to purchase this particular equipment was made after extensive market research of equipment commercially available that would best suit the requirements of the Micro Devices Branch. Consideration was given to the competitive manufacturers on the basis of performance and reliability and the ability to meet the requirements set forth in the SOW. <br>(5) If any prior award was accomplished by full and open competition, a detailed explanation of the changed circumstances. 	n/a<br>(6) An explanation of any unusual patterns which may be revealed by the history, e.g., several consecutive, urgent buys.	n/a<br>(7) If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, briefly describe the circumstances justifying the buy and whether there have been any significant changes.<br>	No significant changes have been realized.
