<DESC>The objective of this effort is to conduct exploratory and advanced research and development of materials technologies to control, manipulate, and protect against photonic energy.  Research involved in the processing, structure, properties and performance of photonic materials will provide a means to mature and transition the highest priority products needed by the Air Force.  These efforts will ultimately result in developed technologies that can be transitioned to legacy, developmental and future Air Force system components to provide an increase in aircrew protection, performance and efficiency while reducing cost and accelerating manufacture.  The objective of this program is to increase aircrew survivability to flash-blindness and directed energy threats through unique and innovative R&amp;D solutions, and to advance the current state-of-the-art in photonic materials technologies, interactions, and applications. Separate Task Orders will contain specific requirements relative to a particular program's technical objectives.  Some of the key technical areas of interest include Optical Materials and Processing, Hardening Materials and Processing, Liquid Crystal Processing, Warfighter Protection. To accomplish these tasks, the contractor will have to have experience in developing, fabricating, and transitioning optical materials into personnel protection systems.  The contractor shall also provide detailed technical input in order to resolve potential programmatic and technical issues encountered at the senior leadership level, as well as special security assistance up through the secret level to maintain proper control of the material classification. These results will then be presented to AFRL and the individual System Program Offices (SPO). <br />The following initial Task orders are anticipated:<br /> Task Order 0001: Flash-Blindness Protection<br /> Task Order 0002: Laser Eye Protection<br />

The contract will be awarded to Inertial Labs (39959 Catoctin Ridge St, Paeonian Springs, VA 20129&#8208;1745).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The AHRS&#8208;I model conclusively provided sufficient accurate heading, pitch and roll data to achieve satellite logon multiple times from different locations. Four AHRS&#8208;I units and Cables with RS&#8208;232 interface were purchased for a small scale, more in&#8208;depth testing on 24 August 2017. After testing concluded, it has been determined that the AHRS&#8208;I is currently the only device that will meet Government requirements.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is conducting a Markey Survey for The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI) Human Factors Research Division ((AAM-500) Flight Deck Research Simulator Maintenance/Upgrade Support for its Legacy (Advanced General Aviation Research Simulator (AGARS), Intersense Head Tracking Systems; Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD); Very Light Jet (VLJ) and Vertical General Aviation Research Simulator (VGARS)) Simulators with Data Collection, Storage and Migration capabilities between general aviation platforms. The FAA intends to review all responses to this market survey to establish the acquisition strategy for:

1. Base Plus Four Options Support Contract

The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only. This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind. The FAA is not seeking or accepting proposals at this time. The FAA intends to award on a single source basis with ZedaSoft,
Inc., Fort Worth, Texas, as they are the only known source for maintenance, hold the proprietary rights and the technical documentation for various upgrades and modifications that have occurred on the hardware/software. It is anticipated the resultant contract will be for a base plus four years.
Background and Scope of Work:

AAM-500 conducts research activities in response to requirements generated through the AVS and Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Research, Engineering, and Development requirement processes. These processes result in sponsor-driven research being brokered to the division by the FAA NextGen Human Factors Division (ANG-C1). As a result, the work accomplished assists operational units within the agency with the ability to answer human factors questions necessary to support or enhance certification, development, administrative, or operational decisions.

The Aerospace Human Factors Research Division is organized in two branches:

 Flight Deck Human Factors Research Laboratory (AAM-510)
 NAS Human Factors Safety Research Laboratory (AAM-520)
Flight Deck Human Factors Research Laboratory (AAM-510)

This laboratory conducts applied human factors research on causal factors associated with aviation accidents and issues involving the design, operation, and maintenance of flight deck equipment in the National Aerospace System (NAS). Research includes assessing advanced technologies, measuring flight performance and risk, evaluating pilot/controller information transfer, determining the effects of stressors on human performance, identifying human factors involved in accidents and incidents, and quantifying the effects of advanced displays, procedures, and task design on pilot
performance.

The work performed within AAM-510 ensures that the objectives in maintaining, upgrading, modifying the General Aviation Research Simulators for specific studies to:

 Effectively respond to requirements generated by AVS and ATO Research, Engineering, and Development requirement processes.

 Assist operational units within the agency to maintain and support human factors research simulators or general aviation.

The Advanced General Aviation Research Simulator Program (AGARS) was acquired to support the Flight Deck Research operations of the Human Factors Research Laboratory, Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI). This system, delivered in early 1995, is a complex device that is designed to be reconfigurable to meet the requirements for changing mission needs of the research program as well as evolve with the technology advances in the general aviation aircraft cockpits. Although designed to be a reliable research tool, the AGARS simulator is unique as a simulator because its entire mission is for Human Factors research. Unlike training simulators that are required by the FAA to not change any of the cockpit equipment without recertification, the AGARS simulator and HUD are designed to be reconfigured specifically for each research study. The many complicated computer systems of the simulators are continually modified to be responsive to the changing technological requirements of agency sponsors (e.g., adding GPS capability to the simulator). As the aerospace industry advances with the digital computer technology, the simulator hardware and software requires constant replacements and modifications to continue to perform adequately for human factor cockpit studies with up to date cockpit equipment.

Submission Requirements & Instructions:

Interested vendors must demonstrate their capabilities to meet the requirements as outlined above in their response to this market survey. Responses must be no longer than three (3) pages in length. In particular, the response must demonstrate the knowledge and experience required to fully integrate
the Government provided systems maintenance and potential upgrades, contemplated in SOW and must include any schedules or BPAs currently in place such as GSA schedule or eFAST. Interested firms are required to submit a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable. The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.

The vendor must submit their response to the Contract Specialist, Brandon Hillyer, by 5PM (CST) on Wednesday, February 7th, 2018. All responses and questions MUST be emailed to Brandon.Hillyer@FAA.gov.

The FAA intends to review all responses to this market survey to establish the acquisition strategy.

This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the FAA will arise as a result of submission of responses to this
market survey and the FAAs use of such information.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) announcement is to identify any interested sources. This is a Sources Sought announcement for market survey purposes only. This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract shall be awarded from this announcement. Sources Sought Announcement for an Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Plug and Fight (P&amp;F) A-Kit and associated IAMD integration, test, and evaluation support requirement. An Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract type is expected to be used. The requirements of this acquisition are to develop and update P&amp;F A-Kit incorporating product end items; and, provide Army IAMD integration, test, and evaluation support including the use of a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HWIL) test bed capability to address critical IAMD risks, verify key Army IAMD requirements, supply critical required high fidelity Pre Flight Test Performance and Predication (PFTPP) data, and identify P&amp;F A-Kit software/interfaces problems/fixes. The Army IAMD Plug and Fight A-Kit for this IDIQ effort is a hardware/software based end item integrated into the Patriot weapon system Engagement Control System (ECS) Major End Item (MEI) forming a new ECS MEI variant named the Radar Interface Unit (RIU) which interfaces with the IAMD System of Systems (SoS).
<p>Unlike traditional acquisition programs that focus primarily on the development of a single system or platform, the Army IAMD Program is uniquely structured to enable the development of an overarching SoS capability with all participating Army Air Defense components functioning interdependently to provide total operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems. The Army IAMD program achieves this objective by establishing the Army IAMD architecture and developing the IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) that provides Engagement Operations Centers (EOCs) implementing common Mission Command (MC) capability, an Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN) capability for fire-control connectivity enabling distributed operations, and the common P&amp;F B-Kits located on the EOCs and IFCN Relays that network enable existing sensor components and weapon components with the IBCS. P&amp;F A-Kits are developed and integrated on the various Component Acquisition Program (CAP) weapon and sensor MEIs and are interfaced to IBCS, which implements the overarching IAMD SoS networking capability. The P&amp;F A-Kits are currently under development by the respective weapon and sensor platform CAP prime contractor to address all unique interface modifications inherent to the component.</p>
<p>The IAMD Project Office, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, has a requirement for the P&amp;F A-Kit which is a unique end item integrated into the Patriot weapon system that is not used by the general public or by non-governmental entities for purposes other than military/government purposes. Consequently, there are no commercial equivalent items or services available. The IAMD P&amp;F A-Kit IDIQ effort includes the need for a classified Patriot system integration and test facility integrated with IBCS MEIs to support the integration and verification of the P&amp;F A-Kit equipped RIU, as well as provide high fidelity IAMD/Patriot data products support to Government IAMD flight test activities commencing in FY 19.</p>
<p>The IAMD P&amp;F A-Kit IDIQ effort also includes an effort to make P&amp;F A-Kit modifications associated with planned/ongoing Patriot Post Deployment Build software effort.</p>
<p>The Government does not currently have available a technical data package for this effort.</p>
<p>Foreign participation will be allowed only at the subcontract level by waiver.</p>
<p>Responses must be received no later than 30 days from the date of this document posting. The posting date is 2 February 2018.</p>
<p>Offeror's response to this announcement shall be limited to 20 pages and shall include the following information:<br />Offeror's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and email address.<br />Offeror's interest in bidding on the solicitation when it is issued.<br />Offeror's CAGE Code, business size, (if a small business, please indicated whether HUB Zone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business etc.)<br />Offeror's Joint Venture information, if applicable 9existing and potential)<br />All responses shall be submitted to the U.S. Army Contracting command, ATTN: CCAM-SM-A/Nicholas B. Kirby and Felicia R. Dortch, Building 5250, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5280 or email nicholas.b.kirby.civ@mail.mil; felicia.r.dortch.civ@mail.mil and courtesy copied to IAMD Project Office, ATTN: SFAE-MSL-IAB/Donna Robinson, Building 5250, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5280 or email donna.j.robinson37.civ@mail.mil.

The submission of this information is for planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any items, nor does the U.S. Army intend to award on the basis of this request for sources sought or otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis:  NATIVE GRASS AND FORB SEED INCREASE AND SUPPLY
Reference:  140L0618R0015

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Operations Center, Denver, CO is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement to increase seed availability of genetically appropriate native species by focusing on Ecoregions and the commensurate seed transfer zones that occur within these Ecoregions. The result of this market research will help finalize the requirement.  

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 111998, Miscellaneous Crop Farming.  

The BLM solicited for a five year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract under Request for Proposal (RFP) L17PS00762; however, BLM cancelled the solicitation that was advertised because we received many questions and realized we needed to do further market research to solidify our requirements. 

This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.  

The cancelled solicitation along with the statement of work and attachments is found at www.fedconnect.net by searching reference number L17PS00762 or click on the link below:  
https://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/default.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fFedConnect%2f%3fdoc%3dL17PS00762%26agency%3dDOI&doc=L17PS00762&agency=DOI

If your organization has the potential capacity to perform the services, please provide the following information: 1) organization name, address, email address, website address, telephone number, and Duns and Bradstreet number; and 2) tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability and 3) comments/responses to our questions listed below.  If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements. 

After reviewing the cancelled solicitation along with the statement of work and attachments, the BLM is interested in your opinions and/or comments on the following questions to solidify our requirements:

1.	Is it generally clear what the goal of the solicitation is, e.g. to increase seed availability of genetically appropriate native species by focusing on Ecoregions and the commensurate seed transfer zones that occur within these Ecoregions?  
2.	After reviewing the Pricing Worksheet, Attachment 3*, of the cancelled solicitation, considering small lots are less than 500 lbs. of seed and large lots are quantities over 500 lbs., would it be more cost effective to price forbs based on a per pound price or by lot size?  Do you believe there should be separately priced forbs depending on the species and method used to increase or would the pricing be significantly different if we priced forbs based on small or large lots only?  If pricing is based on small and large lots, there would be one price for any quantity ordered under 500 lbs.; and vice versa....no separate prices for per pound or testing, method used.  If there is an industry standard in offering or buying forb seed, what is it?
*Remember only the yellow highlighted columns are filled out for entering prices.  The office placing the order will fill out the other columns contained in Attachment 3 for information purposes.
3.	After reviewing the Pricing Worksheet, Attachment 3*, of the cancelled solicitation, Pricing less and over one acre.....Do you believe it was adequate to price species based on "less than one acre" and "over one acre"?  Or would the price significantly change between 1/10, 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 of an acre?  What quantities do you recommend should be requested?  (Choose one of the following)
a.	Less than one acre and greater than one acre?
b.	1/10, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1, 2 and more than 2?
c.	1/10, 1/2, 1, 2, 5 and more than 5?
d.	1/2, 1, 2, 4, and greater than 4?
e.	If you believe the pricing worksheet should have been structured differently?  How?
*Remember only the yellow highlighted columns are filled out for entering prices.  The office placing the order will fill out the other columns contained in Attachment 3 for information purposes.
4. 	Did you have difficulty understanding the statement of work?  How?
5.  	Did you research the expected yields or use your experience in calculating expected yields?
6.  	Would it have been more beneficial if the BLM provided the expected yields for each species?
7.	Was the SOW missing any information that would have been helpful?  Please describe.
8.	Would a pre-proposal conference be necessary or requested to fully understand the requirement?      

BLM will use the market research to determine the most adequate acquisition strategy for this requirement. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions.

Submission Instructions: Interested parties who consider themselves qualified to perform the above-listed services are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice by February 27, 2018, 1700 hours, EST. All responses under this Sources Sought Notice must be emailed to April Blodgett, ablodgett@blm.gov.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice
<p>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) is seeking sources to deliver disk sampling stations in which the contractor will analyze the environmental exposure data retrieved from the stations. The purpose of this contract is to continue researching the health effects of the enclosed submarine atmosphere through execution of the Submarine Atmosphere Health Assessment Program (SAHAP). SAHAP deploys passive chemical dosimeters (sampling stations) onboard US Navy submarines to determine concentrations of various compounds in the atmosphere; then compares them to established Navy 90-day limits. The Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL) requires contracted laboratory support to manufacture and analyze the custom chemical dosimeters, which are necessary to sample the atmosphere in the dynamic submarine environment, on an as-needed basis.<br /><br />NSMRL will order up to 1250 custom sampling stations from the contractor per year. The quantity and type of sampling stations in each order may vary. Custom Sampling Stations ordered by the government shall be manufactured and delivered within three (3) weeks of the order date. NSMRL shall return up to 1250 samples to the contractor following the exposure period for analysis. Analysis of custom sampling stations that are returned to the contractor after exposure shall be completed within three (3) weeks of receipt. Upon completion of analysis, the contractor shall report the outcome of the analysis in the form specified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). To ensure the continuing validity of the data being captured under the NSMRL studies, the sampling stations and analysis must be provided by Assay Technology, Inc. To use another sampling station and analysis could cause disparities in data and invalidate the ongoing studies.<br /><br />The estimated period of performance is for a 12-month base period plus four, 12-month option periods, for a total of 60 months of performance. <br /><br />If capable sources are not identified through this notice, NMLC intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (One source) to Assay Technology, Inc., 1382 Stealth St, Livermore, CA, to provide the described requirement.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Capability statements shall not exceed 5 (8.5 x 11 inch) pages using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information or submissions that only ask questions will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.</p>
<p>Capability statements are due by 4:00 PM Eastern Time, 07 January 2018. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following addresses:<br />jennifer.m.reed20.civ@mail.mil and thomas.l.hood26.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The DARPA Office of the Comptroller (COMP) provides accounting, financial, contractual, systems and other management support for the agency. The functional areas are supported and governed by various statutes, policies, regulations and procedures. Tasks within COMP are often complex and require substantial experience, knowledge and background in a diverse complement of functional areas in order to be performed successfully. COMP is responsible for managing routine financial/accounting tasks as well as numerous other requirements levied upon DARPA by outside entities (primarily the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Office of Management and Budget and The Defense Finance and Accounting Services).</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide support services to include Accounting Operations, Financial Management and Budget Execution Support for DARPA with Financial Analysis, Document Preparation, Reporting, Internal and External Accounting Record Reconciliation Support, review of Reported Amounts for Selected Financial Statement Accounts, Assertion Process and Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICOFR) and Internal Controls over Financial Systems (ICOFS). The contractor will provide this support in three geographic regions:</p>
<p>1) DARPA Headquarters in Arlington, VA<br />2) The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Indianapolis, IN Center <br />3) DFAS Columbus, OH Center</p>
<p>DFAS is the primary finance and accounting service provider for the DoD. For DARPA, these services include maintaining official accounting records, performing payroll functions, settling travel claims, making contract payments, preparing required status reports, and preparing financial statements. The DFAS Indianapolis Center maintains detailed accounting and financial records for DARPA headquarters' administered funds and summary level information for the remaining funds, which are administered by agents in the Military Services, Defense agencies, and civil agencies. Detailed accounting and financial records for agent-administered funds are maintained at the DFAS Centers and operating locations supporting those agents. DFAS Indianapolis uses summary level information from the Defense Departmental Reporting Database-Automated Financial Statements System (DDRS-AFS) to prepare DARPA's financial statements. DFAS Columbus entitles and disburses many contracts containing DARPA funds and serves as a main support organization for our Air Force Agents. <br />If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide the following information: 1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address, telephone number, and size and type of ownership for the organization; and 2) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability.

Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.  If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used.  Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>Attention all potential respondents: If this acquisition is not set aside for small business, it is anticipated that the contract may contain a small business utilization requirement.  Please provide feedbacks on what areas of this requirement are likely candidates for small business subcontracting.</p>
<p>Part II.  Request for Information:<br />If possible, please provide answers to the following questions.</p>

<p>2. Is there an alternate NAICS that you believe is more appropriate for this requirement?  If so, what is the NAICS and why?</p>
<p>3. Is there anything in the PWS that has the effect of creating duplicative of unnecessary costs to the Government?  Do you have any additional comments on the PWS?</p>
<p>4. Based on your experience, are the requested services commercial in nature as defined by FAR 2.101?  If so, why, and are there established catalog or market prices for these services?</p>

<DESC>Description:
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government and respondents will not be entitled to payment of direct or indirect cost incurred in responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO), Strategic Sourcing Acquisition Division (SSAD), located in Silver Spring, MD, is conducting market research for the purpose of assessing the current and near future High Performance Computing (HPC) marketplace, potential suppliers of HPC technology services, and changes in market conditions which have the potential to advance the NOAA Weather and Climate Operational Supercomputing Systems (WCOSS). Responses to this RFI will assist the Government in developing and refining its requirements for the follow-on contract based on market trends and new technology.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>NOAA National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP is recognized as a world leader in understanding and predicting the Earth's environment through advanced modeling capabilities, climate research and real time weather products. The growing concern of global climate change, weather impacts upon homeland security and aviation, hurricanes, tornadoes and other severe weather have spurred growing demand for weather, climate, ocean, and space weather information with increased accuracy, shorter lead times and greater model resolution. Hence, NCEP has a continuing and increasing need for the computational power essential to meet its mission strategic goals related to weather, climate, air quality, coastal and ocean resource management.</p>
<p>The WCOSS provides computing capabilities that are essential in the support of increasingly more complex environmental models. The models must complete on time, all the time with a growing volume of input data (including observational and satellite based data) which is synchronized to an external (outside of WCOSS) worldwide data collection cycle. The WCOSS must be highly dependable and reliable as operational models are required to be run many times a day within a prescribed time window and model guidance products must be disseminated on a fixed time schedule.</p>
<p>NOAA's current WCOSS environment requires the contractor to design, deliver and support a complete and fully integrated system consisting of identical (i.e. hardware, operating systems, etc.) primary and backup HPCs solution capable of immediate failover transfer to operational readiness within minutes. One of the HPCS' is used in the operational environment, and the second HPCS is used for Transition to Operations (T2O) workloads and serve as a backup to the operational system. The two systems must be symmetrical. The primary and backup HPCs are currently housed in separate facilities located more than 120 miles apart to ensure continuity of operations.</p>
<p>The HPCS requirements include scheduled scalable technology enhancements, unanticipated additional internal (NOAA) HPC requirements. Maintaining the current computational power and increasing this power through scalable measures overtime is essential for NOAA to meet its strategic goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>NOAA is seeking innovative concepts and approaches to obtain the needed computing systems, facilities and services for consideration in the development of the follow-on WCOSS requirement. The Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and supporting documents attached with this RFI are intended to open a formal communication channel between industry and the Government as well as to provide the High Performance Computing Industry with insight to the NOAA/NCEP unique system requirements. The PWS represents a draft IDIQ framework that describes the scope of the requirements for this contract. Task Orders will be issued over the life of the IDIQ contract that will provide more specificity. The Government is open to Industry's input in defining the current requirements.</p>
<p>The WCOSS requirements are for a "total solution" using a managed service approach wherein the Contractor owns and manages all aspects of the HPC supplies and services required in the performance of the contract. This includes the establishment of a based-lined legacy HPC system with scheduled, scalable technology enhancements. The managed service also includes, but is not limited to, facilities, systems (i.e. hardware, operating systems, etc.) and support personnel to permit forecast productions (operational) as well as transition to operations (research and development modeling of code) by NCEP personnel in support of their mission.</p>
<p><br />Procurement Overview</p>
<p>The anticipated follow-on contract resulting from the solicitation will be a single-award, multi-year, Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract, with the ability to issue Firm-Fixed Price (FFP), Fixed Price Award Fee (FPAF), Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF), Time and Material (T&amp;M), Cost Reimbursable (CR) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) task orders thereunder. The contract is anticipated to have a ten year period of performance, consisting of a base ordering period of eight years and a two year transition period.</p>
<p>The Request For Proposal (RFP) for WCOSS is anticipated to be issued in January 2019, with contract award by fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2020 and initial delivery of the new system not later than the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2022.</p>
<p>Information Released with RFI</p>
<p>The attachments to the RFI include the Appendices and Benchmark Codes descriptions to be used as a source of information. The Benchmarks are in the process of being updated and not ready for release at this time. All information will be updated with the release of the pre-solicitation notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information Requested</p>
<p>The Government welcomes industry comments, questions and suggestions that will aid it in understanding industry capabilities, developing its acquisition strategy and finalizing the PWS. In an effort to benefit fully from industry responses to this RFI, vendors are encouraged to schedule one-on-one information exchanges with the Government. One of the principal outcomes of vendor/government dialog will be to ensure that alternate approaches that may reduce cost and risk are considered in the follow-on procurement. The Government may therefore utilize the information provided to refine its acquisition strategy to maximize competition among viable acquisition alternatives.</p>
<p>It is not the Government's intent to disclose vendor proprietary information and trade secrets to the public. The information submitted by vendors during the market research period may be used by the Government in preparing its RFP and finalizing the PWS, provided this can be done without disclosing proprietary vendor information that is protected from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Interested vendors should respond in writing to the following topics:</p>
<p>1) Historically, NOAA has received support for WCOSS through contracts providing HPC as a service. Specifically, these contracts required Contractors to provide all necessary labor, equipment, and facilities (i.e. data center support) as a total HPC solution in the form of a managed service. The Contractor would be reimbursed based on NOAA's usage/access of the total system and the HPC infrastructure provided. Concerning specifications, the total solution HPC capability would need to meet minimum performance benchmarks, and historically has required a minimum system and system availability level of 99.99%.</p>
<p>Question: Please provide feedback on whether or not such a technical approach is still viable in the HPC marketplace today. If this approach is no longer viable, please explain why this is the case, as well as provide recommendations for what items in this explanation would need to change to make the requirement more viable.</p>
<p>2) Historically, the total solution HPC capability would need to meet minimum performance benchmarks, with a required minimum system and data availability level of 99.99%. On a monthly basis, NOAA has assessed contractual penalties when a contractor is unable to meet this availability level. The disincentive is applied to the availability level of both Operational Use Time (OUT) and Development Use Time (DUT).</p>
<p>Question: Do the disincentives for Operational Use Time (OUT) and Development Use Time (DUT) pose a risk such that they would impact your company's decision on whether or not to take part in this acquisition? Does the methodology used for calculating OUT and DUT a valid measurement? If not what would alternative do you suggest?</p>
<p>3) NOAA has historically obtained HPC as a service by issuing five (5) year, multi-year contracts in accordance with FAR 17.1. The scope of these contracts would cover all necessary labor, equipment, and facilities (i.e. data center support) to provide a total solution HPC capability as a service. As indicated in FAR 17.1, this may require contractors to incur upfront investment costs which are then amortized over the life of the contract, with contractor reimbursement occurring incrementally throughout the performance period. Per FAR 17.106-1(c), a funded cancellation ceiling is typically required to cover the contractor's unamortized investment costs that would need to be compensated for in the event the contract is cancelled.</p>
<p>Question: What is industry's feedback on this contracting approach? Are there issues or concerns with using this approach in the future that NOAA should consider in developing the WCOSS contract structure? Also, if Program funding is limited for WCOSS, would industry be amenable to an unfunded cancellation ceiling, wherein compensation would be guaranteed in the event of Program or contract cancellation; however, the cancellation ceiling would not be funded until the need arises?</p>
<p>3) Does the Draft PWS provide sufficient detail to describe the technical requirements that encompass the work to be performed under this effort? If "No", please provide your technical comments/recommendation on elements of the Draft PWS that may contribute to a more accurate proposal submission and efficient, cost effective effort.</p>
<p>4) Are the requirements as stated neutral to both Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and Systems Integrator? If not please explain.</p>
<p>5) Do any of the requirements appear to be ambiguous or too vague? If so, please list them with your concerns.</p>
<p>6) Are the charts and graphs found in the appendices useful?</p>
<p>7) Describe your approach to providing required services. Briefly describe your organization's involvement in providing HPC systems. Has this involvement included weather/climate applications? Does your organization have experience in supporting 24X7 operations? Does your organization have experience in delivering, operating, and maintaining high availability systems? Please provide previous or existing contract numbers and descriptions along with contact information.</p>
<p>8) What additional information or data concerning the current WCOSS operations should be included in the Statement of Work?</p>
<p>9) Does the planned upgrade schedule for the initial task pose any significant challenges or concerns? If so please explain.</p>
<p>10) Describe your approach to providing required services. Briefly describe your organization's involvement in providing HPC systems. Has this involvement included weather/climate applications? Does your organization have experience in supporting 24X7 operations? Does your organization have experience in delivering, operating, and maintaining high availability systems? Please provide previous or existing contract numbers and descriptions along with contact information.</p>
<p>11) Are there alternative methods for providing the required an HPC "total solution" as a service?</p>
<p>12) Describe any anticipated HPC technology developments (i.e. compute, storage, network) that NOAA should be aware of to ensure that the PWS elicits the best responses from the vendor community.</p>
<p>13) Describe the largest file size Vendor's system can handle now, whether this is a hardware or software limitation and projections for the largest file size during the base and option periods of performance. Describe any alternatives solutions to maximize file size and trade-offs compared with other solutions. Describe the largest number of nodes Vendor's file system can handle now and projections for the base and option periods of performance. Describe any alternatives solutions to maximize node number and trade-offs compared with other solutions.</p>
<p>Multiple or alternative approaches are welcome. Although this RFI requests specific information, it is not intended to discourage innovative thinking on the part of industry to propose alternative solutions or approaches that the Government may not have considered.</p>
<p>Vendors responding should provide a point-of-contact, including: representative's name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number.</p>
<p>Respondents shall include the following information in their submissions:</p>

<DESC>1.0 SOURCES SOUGHT DESCRIPTION <br />1.1 The United States Marine Corps (USMC), Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Radar Systems is issuing Request For Information (RFI) as a means of conducting a market survey to determine potential sources having the skills and capabilities necessary to provide commercially available, non-developmental components to integrate hardware changes into the AN/TPS-59A(V)3 Long Range Air Surveillance Radar System in response to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS).
<p>MCSC&lrm; seeks solutions for the AN/TPS-59A(V)3 Long Range Air Surveillance Radar System that will increase the reliability of the radar's solid state row transmitters (while reducing obsolescence and DMSMS). The Government will consider a wide spectrum of proposed solutions including, but not limited to; complete row transmitter replacement assemblies, a modification kit applied to legacy row transmitter assemblies and other solutions. Any proposed solution must meet the Space, Weight and Power requirements as well as input power, monitor and control signals and output power and waveform requirements as defined Attachment A. If executed under a separate contracting action, the total requirement of row transmitter assemblies or modification kits is estimated at 800 to 1000 assemblies/kits phased across multiple years.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued for the sole purpose of soliciting market research from industry regarding the availability of Row Transmitter related technologies, capabilities and limitations. Furthermore, responses to this RFI are strictly voluntary and will be used solely for market research to determine associated recurring and non-recurring costs of those systems, sustainment requirements and the likely presence of competition. <br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. RESPONSES ARE FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.</p>
<p>2.0 BACKGROUND<br />2.1 Initially fielded in 1984, the Marine Corps' AN/TPS-59A(V)3 Radar System is an L-Band (1215 - 1400 MHz), 3-D, air cooled, solid state, row based, phase array, long range air surveillance radar capable of detecting air breathing targets (ABTs) to 300 nautical miles (NM) and 100 Kft / Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBMs) to 400 NM and 500 Kft. The array design architecture consists of 54 Row Transmitters, 54 Row Receivers, 27 Row Power Supplies and 54 Row Feed assemblies with associated mono-pulse and monitor feed assemblies. <br />2.2 Any proposed Row Transmitter Replacement or Transmitter Modification Kit shall integrate within the same physical and electrical environments as the legacy transmitters. Changes to input power, control, monitoring and Radio Frequency (RF) Drive signals are not desired. Any proposed changes to input power, control, monitoring and RF Drive signals will be considered by the Government as having the potential of adding additional cost and integration complexity to the solution unless the contractor can substantiate otherwise. Comparable gain and phase stability across the spectrum are required. The radiated waveform shall adhere to applicable National Telecommunication and Information Agency (NTIA) requirements contained within the Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management.</p>
<p>Respondents are encouraged to provide rationale and documentation to justify claims, specifically claims that imply gains in performance and/or reliability. <br /><br />3.0 REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />3.1 The minimum technical requirements are identified in Attachment A.<br />3.2 MCSC will not pay or provide reimbursement for any costs incurred in the preparation or delivery of responses to this RFI. Sources capable of satisfying the above requirements should submit a response with capability statements and expressions of interest that provide the Government with sufficient information to determine actual capability. At a minimum, this information should include the following: <br />3.2.1 Firms should identify in their response whether your company is a small or large business under the NAICS Code 334511 (standard size is 750 employees). If small, you should also identify if your company is a Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), Women-owned Small Business, HUB-Zone Small Business, or Service Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business concern; <br />3.2.2 Your company's or organization's assertion of its existing and available capability to meet the requirements in Attachment A; <br />3.2.3 Business, contracts, and/or marketing office points of contact information; <br />3.2.4 Cost information, to include any recurring and sustainment costs;<br />3.2.5 A statement declaring whether the business or organization is a US or Foreign-Owned entity; and<br />3.2.6 Any additional information that may be useful to the successful procurement and testing of the Row Transmitter Assemblies, if solicited.<br /><br />4.0 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS<br /><br />4.1 Those expressing interest shall adhere to a total submission limit of fifteen pages, plus commercial marketing information or web links which may be used as amplifying information.<br />4.2 Please submit all written responses electronically. Respondents should submit their white paper responses by&nbsp;9 March 2018 to Clint Wells at clinton.wells@usmc.mil and Stasia Baker at stasia.baker@usmc.mil.

<CONTACT>James E. Platner, Contracting Officer, Email james.platner@navy.mil - Melissa Donnelly, Contract Specialist, Email Melissa.Donnelly@navy.mil
<DESC>&nbsp;The United States Navy (USN), in collaboration with the United States Coast Guard (USCG) under an Integrated Program Office, is releasing a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Heavy Polar Icebreaker (HPIB) program.
<p><br />The draft RFP is for the Detail, Design and Construction (DD&amp;C) of one (1) HPIB cutter, with options for two (2) additional HPIB cutters (N00024-18-R-2210). Support CLINs for Provisioned Items orders to outfit the ships and purchase spares, repair parts, and other special equipment; Engineering and Industrial Services in support of Government systems installation and post-delivery activities; Special Studies for Government-directed engineering tasks; and Crew Familiarization are anticipated to be incorporated into the resultant contract.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent that the HPIB be procured utilizing competitive procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15 with an anticipated RFP release in the second quarter of FY18.</p>
<p>In Industry's response to this draft RFP, the Government requests use of the document (Excel) titled "HPIB Draft RFP Comment Submittal Form." Further, the Government is seeking industry input on the following special areas:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Provide comments on the prospective inclusion of a Schedule Incentive that motivates early delivery or otherwise reduces schedule risk. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Provide comments on the prospective inclusion of a CAPEX incentive that motivates investments that have the opportunity to reduce technical, cost, and schedule risk to the program. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Provide comments on the Section H 5252.232-9105 Payments clause.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Provide comments on the Section H 5252.216-9127 Economic Price Adjustments clause.</p>
<p>The Government is prepared to release the following documents to each company. Updates to the solicitation, including draft RFP Sections L and M, will be posted as they become available.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Heavy Polar Icebreaker (HPIB) draft Request for Proposal<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Section J Attachment 1 draft HPIB System Specification<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Section J Attachment 4 draft Supplemental Test Statement of Work<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Section J Attachment 5 draft Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) List<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Section J Attachment 7 draft Government Furnished Information (GFI) List</p>
<p>This draft RFP is provided as an advance notice to ease proposal lead time, further design maturity, and assist teaming arrangements (if applicable). Based on technical complexity, the Government's market research indicates there are not two or more small business concerns capable of competing for the requirement.

No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor responses to this announcement. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION<br />The purpose of contract is to provide services for the United States Coast Guard Academy (USCGA) that are proprietary to The College Board. These services include College Board's Enrollment Planning Service (EPS), Student Search Service (SSS), and Segment Analysis Service (SAS).</p>
<p>UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED.<br />The College Board has a monopoly on college bound student records that contain educationally relevant data useful for recruiting these individuals, qualifying them, defining markets and competitors, and assessing institutional outcomes. The concept of monopoly relates to the geography. Similar resources are available from ACT, but the two organizations dominate in different geographic localities . The College Board data base, is however, much larger and provides superior coverage of the markets from which the Academy principally draws applicants.</p>
<p>REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:<br />The College Board is the only list service with academic, demographic and personal data that also provides SAT, AP, and PSAT test scores.</p>

PROVISION FAR 52.212-1 -- INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS, applies to this acquisition.  

FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS 

(a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Award will be made using a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) approach; the Government will award to the lowest priced offeror that is determined technically acceptable.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

(i)	Factor 1: Technical Capability 

(1.)	 The offeror shall submit their technical approach and demonstrated experience/evidence of ability to successfully perform the services.  The factor will be rated as "Technically Acceptable" or "Technically Unacceptable."
(2.)	"Technically Acceptable" is defined as the item offered to the Government that meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. 
(3.)	"Technically Unacceptable" is defined as the item offered to the Government that does not meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.


(ii)	Factor 2:  Past Performance

1.	Past performance shall provide adequate information describing the offeror's previous experience in providing furniture and similar services within the past three years from the issuance date of this RFQ. The offeror shall also list all contracts performed in the past three years from issue date of this RFQ that are of the same magnitude and complexity of this project. In addition, the Government may solicit past performance on contracts not listed by the offeror. If an offeror does not have any past performance information to submit as the entity under which the offer is being submitted, then the offeror should submit past performance data identified above under which the offeror's key personnel have worked.  The offeror's quote will be evaluated to determine the extent to which its past performance demonstrates the likelihood of successful performance.  The evaluation will consider both the relevance and quality of past projects.  The Government may choose to evaluate publicly available reports, and/or data from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).   The Government may use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources. The information gathered for past performance may also be used in the responsibility determination. An Offeror without relevant past performance will receive a neutral rating (i.e., neither technically acceptable nor technically unacceptable).  


Technical and past performance, when combined, are equal to cost or price.  

(b)	 Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c)	Award Process: 

1.	The Government will first evaluate all quotations to ensure the quotation complies with all material aspects of the request for quotation thereby being determined as either "Responsive" or "Non-Responsive." 

2.	 Responsive quotes will then be submitted for Technical Evaluation to determine those that are either "Technically Acceptable" or "Technically Unacceptable."

3.	"Technically Acceptable" quotations will be then ranked according to Price.

4.	The lowest priced offeror who is technically acceptable will receive the award.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

FAR 52.212-3 - OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS

<DESC>Background: <br />The Department of Defense (DoD) is required by law (10 U.S.C. &sect; 1074g) to establish an effective, efficient, integrated pharmacy benefits program for the Military Health System (MHS) which includes the purchase pharmaceutical agents. The law and implementing regulation (32 CFR Section 199.21) describe the process by which the DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&amp;T) Committee will consider the relative clinical effectiveness and relative cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents in a therapeutic class in recommending the selection of agents for the DoD Uniform Formulary (UF) and, for cost sharing purposes, the classification of a pharmaceutical agent as generic, formulary, Basic Core Formulary (BCF), Extended Core Formulary (ECF), or non-formulary (NF). Prior to the scheduled P&amp;T Committee meeting, a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for pharmaceutical agents within Drug Classes identified for placement on the UF has been issued to obtain quotes from industry. The Defense Health Agency may award Uniform Formulary Blanket Purchase Agreements (UF BPA) and the Uniform Formulary Additional Discount Program Agreements (UF ADP) based on the UF decision. This process is described in the attached RFQ. <br /><br />P&amp;T COMMITTEE MEETING: May 2018: The following drug classes/subclass and agents will be reviewed: <br /><br />GASTROINTESTINAL-2 AGENTS - OPIOID INDUCED CONSTIPATION: Movantik, Relistor, Symproic<br /><br />GROWTH STIMULATING AGENTS: Genotropin, Humatrope, Humatropen, Norditropin Flexpro, Nutropin AQ, Nutropin AQ Nuspin, Omnitrope, Saizen, Saizen-SaizenPrep, Serostim, Zomacton, Zorbtive<br /><br />PANCREATIC ENZYME AGENTS: Creon, Pancreaze, Pertze, Ultresa, Viokace, Zenpep<br /><br />RFQ: The RFQ, including UF BPA and UF ADP appendices are attached herein. The historical utilization data including quantity dispensed and 30 day equivalents by mouth is also attached herein.<br /><br />PRE-Proposal Conference: See Paragraphs 2.4 and 2.5 of the RFQ. Minutes will be posted herein. <br /><br />CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS: Interested parties or potential offerors may provide clinical presentations. To schedule, call 1-210-536-6116. Clinical presentations must be made available on CD (not retained by POD San Antonio staff) at time of presentation. Flash drives are not authorized for use on DoD computers. We are also requesting a dossier. A few weeks prior to the meeting, we will send you a list of detailed questions. <br /><br />POCs: See below and paragraph 2.3 of the RFQ.

<CONTACT>Robert B. Halliday, MMESO Europe Clinical Analyst, Phone 011-49-6371-9464-4090, Email robert.b.halliday2.ctr@mail.mil - Mr. Tom Winkel, MMESO Europe Team Leader, Phone 314-590-4089 (DSN), Email thomas.p.winkel.ctr@mail.mil
<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Tubing Suction and Connectors. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) ME-1703-25_Tubing_Suction_and_Connectors are eligible for participation. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong><br /><br />These Tubing Suction and Connectors products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. Vendors must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs, CARDINAL HEALTH and OWENS &amp; MINOR, to distribute through the PV Program. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL ME-1703-25_Tubing_Suction_and_Connectors. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of three (3) years (36 months) from date of selection, with one (1) 24-month "option" period not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is 21 Mar 18. Among vendors who are on QSL ME-1703-25_Tubing_Suction_and_Connectors, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Tubing Suction and Connectors.<br /><br /><strong>Vendors agree to hold the submitted IA pricing firm for 75 days from the date specified for receipt of their IA offer. Notification of non-selection will be sent once the IA process is completed and the bilateral IA is signed.</strong><br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Tubing Suction and Connectors. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $448,878 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL ME-1703-25_Tubing_Suction_and_Connectors who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below. </strong>In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO Europe via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.</strong><br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures<br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. The best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes if determined necessary.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the response date of this Sources Sought Notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers, pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. An IA will only be issued once the Vendor has established Fair and Reasonable base uncommitted DAPA prices for each product in the product line. Failure to establish approved DAPA base uncommitted prices will preclude a vendor from establishing an IA with the government. Use these instructions to complete the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.</strong><br /><br />1. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><strong><br />Required Products / Annual Usage in Units /</strong><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, such as Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices, incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices such as FSS prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: DAPA holders must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs to distribute through the PV Program. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to both PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." It is strongly recommended that participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items, whether they are deemed usage or non-usage by the MTFs, and factor PV costs into their offered IA tier pricing.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks have, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(3) The clause at 52.212-5.

(9) The specification.
(t) System for Award Management (SAM).
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Governments reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<BR><BR>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractors SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
(u) Unauthorized Obligations
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractors representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor.

Unenforceability of Unauthorized Obligations (Jun 2013)

(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

(c) Include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in all subcontracts with small business concerns, including subcontracts with small business concerns for the acquisition of commercial items.<BR><BR>a) This contract is subject to 41 U.S.C chapter 71, Contract Disputes.

(c) Claim, as used in this clause, means a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking, as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other relief arising under or relating to this contract. However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71 until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71. The submission may be converted to a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.
(ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim.
(iii) The certification shall state as follows: I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor.<BR><BR>(3) The certification may be executed by any person authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officers decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractors specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment.

If the offeror certifies to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(d)(3) that the Service Contract Act-<br />(1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Labor Standards clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; or<br />(2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at FAR 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards to Contracts for Certain Services--Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offer, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis.<br />(c) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision-<br />(1) The clause of this solicitation at 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards to Contracts for Certain Services--Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; and<br />(2) The offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible if the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation.<br />(d) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror, if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of this provision or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (c) of this provision.<br />(End of provision)</p>

<p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

<p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.

<DESC>Introduction:<br />The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.
<p>Requirement:<br />NIAID will solicit proposals to identify novel adjuvant candidates that can be used to augment the efficacy of human vaccines. Research solicited will contribute to the pipeline of new adjuvant leads that either: (a) exploit the natural capacity of the innate immune system to initiate and sustain effective T and B cell responses and to induce long term immune memory, or (b) act directly on cells of the adaptive immune system to enhance their response to pathogen-derived antigens.</p>
<p>Studies must include testing of adjuvant candidates with experimental or FDA approved preventative or therapeutic vaccines in relevant animal models to determine the potential efficacy of the vaccine against one or more pathogens relevant to human disease. In addition, when reagents are not available for vaccine antigens, model antigens may be used for limited studies to examine mechanisms of action of the candidate adjuvants.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that multiple cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a 12-month period of performance beginning on or about July 15, 2019. NIAID estimates the average annual total cost per award (direct and indirect costs) will be $2M. Total cost for the award(s) may vary depending upon the scope of the project and the technical objectives of the award(s). The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research. In no event shall the period of performance proposed by an offeror exceed 5 years.</p>
<p>The research will be solicited through a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). The BAA will only be available electronically on or about February 5, 2018 through the Government wide point of entry (GPE): FedBizOpps.gov (www.fbo.gov).</p>
<p>Printed copies of the announcement will not be distributed. Updates or corrections to the announcement will be posted to the GPE. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. Collect calls will not be accepted. Facsimile transmissions will not be accepted.</p>
<p>The BAA is governed by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2) and FAR 35.016, as well as the NIH Policy Manual, Manual Chapter 6035, Broad Agency Announcements. A BAA may be used as a solicitation mechanism for basic and applied research directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement. BAAs are general in nature, identifying areas of research interest, and shall only be used when meaningful proposals with varying technical/scientific approaches can be reasonably anticipated.</p>
<p>Offers submitted in response to this BAA will be required to present separate detailed technical and business proposals designed to meet the Technical Objectives described for each Research Area proposed. The Statement of Work (SOW), including the specific technical requirements and performance specifications, shall be developed and proposed by the Offeror, not the Government.</p>
<p>Submission of Proposals:<br />All responsible sources may submit a proposal. For this solicitation, the NIAID requires proposals be submitted only online via the NIAID electronic Contract Proposal Submission (eCPS) website at https://ecps.nih.gov/NIAID. Submission of proposals by facsimile or e-mail is not acceptable. For directions on using eCPS, go to the eCPS website and click on "How to Submit."</p>

<p>PART 12 - GENERAL EVALUATION INFORMATION</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2</p>
<p>(a) The Government will issue a single IDIQ contract to the responsible contractor whose quote, conforming to the solicitation, is found to be most advantageous to the Government. The following factors which are listed in order of importance shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Project: Service and Maintenance of Government-owned Thermo Equipment<br />A. Approach <br />a. Offeror should document capabilities and procedures to include:<br />i. Establishment and maintenance of a preventive maintenance schedule for all covered instruments<br />ii. Preventive maintenance and instrument repair program<br />iii. Service call placement, and response procedure<br />iv. Geographic proximity and/or other asset that will ensure timely response<br />v. 24/365 technical availability<br />vi. Instrument-specific experience and capability<br />vii. Repair part availability<br />viii. Maintenance of a history file on all services performed<br />ix. Service and summary reports<br />x. Quality assurance system to ensure that services conform to the requirements</p>
<p><br />B. Personnel <br />a. Offerors should demonstrate experience, qualifications, and availability of the proposed personnel to include detailed resumes, relevant proof of training as well as a description of previous experience with and sound performance of projects of similar complexity:<br />i. Offerors should demonstrate experience, qualifications, and availability of the proposed personnel appointed to this contract effort to fulfill the administrative requirements for successful contract monitoring and reporting.<br />ii. The technical personnel proposed to perform on this contract should be trained and experienced with demonstrated ability to maintain the types of instruments listed in attachment I and preparation of service reports.</p>
<p>C. Facilities and Equipment <br />a. Offeror should demonstrate availability of specialized tools, test equipment, parts meeting or exceeding OEM standards, supplies, and equipment resources sufficient to perform this contract effort.</p>
<p>D. Past Performance will be evaluated independently and will not be scored<br />a. Response must include two (2) references that demonstrate experience in providing maintenance and repairs for similar equipment.</p>
<p>Rating Methods</p>
<p>Technical Factors: One of the following ratings will be assigned:</p>
<p>RATING DEFINITION<br />Exceptional (E) Exceeds specified minimum performance or capability requirements in a way beneficial to the government; proposal must have one or more strengths and no deficiencies to receive an exceptional.<br />Acceptable (A) Meets specified minimum performance or capability requirements delineated in the Request for Proposal; proposal rated Acceptable must have no major deficiencies but may have one or more strengths.<br />Marginal (M) Does not clearly meet some specified minimum performance or capability requirements delineated in the Request for Proposal, but these weaknesses may be correctable.<br />Unacceptable (U) Fails to meet specified minimum performance or capability requirements; proposal has one or more deficiencies. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.</p>
<p><br />Past Performance Factor: Relevancy and Performance Assessment:</p>
<p>One of the following Relevancy ratings will be assigned:</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE RELEVANCY RATINGS<br />Rating Definition<br />Very Relevant Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Relevant Present/past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Somewhat Relevant Present/past performance effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Not Relevant Present/past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>The combination of relevancy and recency, and performance documented by the information collected by the Government, will result in one of the following ratings:</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown (See note below.)<br />No Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the quoter will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance and in the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>4. Price: The Government anticipates that adequate price competition will establish a fair and reasonable price. However, if the Government does not receive adequate price competition, it will evaluate price quotations to ensure price reasonableness of the services being provided to the Government, considering the specific terms and conditions and relevant commercial practices.</p>
<p>The government intends to issue a Purchase Order without discussions. The government reserves the right to enter into discussions if an unacceptable quote can be made acceptable.</p>

<p>The offeror shall submit the following:</p>
<p>1. Technical Quotation: A quotation that conforms to the solicitation's requirements with an explanation of how your firm intends to satisfy the requirements of required maintenance. The quote shall provide sufficient information and supporting data to address how the quote meets the required maintenance.<br /><br />NOTE: Statements that the offeror understands, can or will comply with all specifications, or statements paraphrasing the specifications of parts thereof, or phrases such as "standard procedures will be used" or "well known techniques will be used: will be considered insufficient. Insufficient explanations of how your company will comply with the above of this solicitation may cause your offer to be deemed not technically acceptable.</p>
<p>2. Price Quotation: A unit price (with extended amount) for each line item.</p>
<p>3. Quotations are due by February 16, 2018, 1:00 PM, EST and submitted via e-mail to christopher.fisher@nih.gov. Send questions, via e-mail, to the Contract Specialist no later than February 9, 5:00 PM EST.</p>
<p>PART 12 - GENERAL EVALUATION INFORMATION</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Listed in order of importance:</p>
<p>1. SERVICE ENGINEER EXPERIENCE<br />2. 72 HOUR ON-SITE RESPONSE TIME<br />3. MANUFACTURER SPECIFIED PARTS<br />4. UNLIMITED REPAIR VISITS</p>
<p>Rating Methods</p>
<p>Technical Factors: One of the following ratings will be assigned:</p>
<p>RATING DEFINITION<br />Exceptional (E) Exceeds specified minimum performance or capability requirements in a way beneficial to the government; proposal must have one or more strengths and no deficiencies to receive an exceptional.<br />Acceptable (A) Meets specified minimum performance or capability requirements delineated in the Request for Proposal; proposal rated Acceptable must have no major deficiencies but may have one or more strengths.<br />Marginal (M) Does not clearly meet some specified minimum performance or capability requirements delineated in the Request for Proposal, but these weaknesses may be correctable.<br />Unacceptable (U) Fails to meet specified minimum performance or capability requirements; proposal has one or more deficiencies. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.</p>
<p><br />Past Performance Factor: Relevancy and Performance Assessment:</p>
<p>One of the following Relevancy ratings will be assigned:</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE RELEVANCY RATINGS<br />Rating Definition<br />Very Relevant Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Relevant Present/past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Somewhat Relevant Present/past performance effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Not Relevant Present/past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>The combination of relevancy and recency, and performance documented by the information collected by the Government, will result in one of the following ratings:</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown (See note below.)<br />No Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the quoter will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance and in the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>Price: The Government anticipates that adequate price competition will establish a fair and reasonable price. However, if the Government does not receive adequate price competition, it will evaluate price quotations to ensure price reasonableness of the services being provided to the Government, considering the specific terms and conditions and relevant commercial practices.</p>

<p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NFFP7300-18-01105CM2.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-97 (Deviation 2017-01).</p>
<p>(IV) This solicitation is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The associated NAICS code is 336612. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for the purchase of the following commercial item(s):</p>
<p>Provide an at-see vessel, vessel operator, and deckhand to assist the National Oceanic, Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in conducting deployment and recovery of a Slocum Glider, as well as deployment and recovery of acoustic receivers. Mobile acoustic tracking conducted to ground-truth fixed array and glider array and glider detections of acoustically tagged sturgeon. Trips will consist of no more than 10 sequential day trips along the Oregon coast, between Newport and Charleston within three nautical miles from shore. The vessel crew will be responsible for both deploying and retrieving the acoustic receivers and for deploying and retrieving the Slocum glider as needed.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows: <br />Contractor agrees to provide an at-sea research platform (vessel) to deploy and recover acoustic receivers in depths ranging from approximately 7 to 50 fathoms. The preferred departure/return port for most operations is central Oregon (i.e., Newport, Florence, or Charleston), as much of the sampling effort will occur in this vicinity. No more than ten (10) vessel days (day = approximately 10 hours/day) are estimated to be needed for deployment of acoustic receivers, for mobile acoustic tracking and for glider retrieval near Brookings. Effort will be split into two seasonal phases (spring and summer 2018), taking place over four (4) to six (6) days with the exact dates to be mutually-agreed upon after the contract has been awarded. Each seasonal deployment will be split into two periods, each lasting 2- to 3-days (one for receiver deployment and one for receiver and glider retrieval). Each of these periods will be compressed into as short a period as possible, ideally consecutive days. Some days may be devoted to mobile acoustic tracking. Deployments may occur over various substrates at depths less than 40 fathoms and will involve dropping a weight (heavy chain links not to exceed 120 lbs) with attached line, receiver and buoy at each prescribed location (see Attachment 1). Retrieval will involve hooking the buoy or glider and hauling line using a crab block. The contractor will be responsible for providing the prescribed moorings for receiver attachment (see Attachment 1).</p>
<p>On days not needed for deployments/retrievals, the vessel operator will assist with mobile tracking surveys to ground-truth fixed arrays and glider detections. This will involve positioning of a hydrophone and or receiving unit along the rail of the vessel and into the water at a depth below the hull. At selected locations the vessel operator will be requested to allow the vessel to drift and silence all possible acoustic noise sources (e.g., depth sounder) while a survey for acoustically-tagged fish is performed. Operations may occur on single days or consecutive days as allowable due to weather or logistics.</p>
<p>Place of Performance:<br />Off the Oregon Coast<br />Near Reedsport, OR &amp; Seal Rock, OR<br />(VII) Period of Performance:<br />April 1, 2018 through September 30, 2018</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016) NAM</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br /><br />5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(XIV) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating does not apply.</p>
<p>(XV) Quotes are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 4:00 P.M. MST on February 16, 2018. All quotes must be faxed or emailed to the attention of Casey Morris. The fax number is 303- 497-3163 and email address is casey.morris@noaa.gov</p>

<DESC>W912DW18R0018 <br />Headstones Realignment and Cleaning for Fort Vancouver Post Cemetery, WA for 88th Regional Support Command, Washington<br />Notice Type: Solicitation
<p>I. SYNOPSIS:</p>
<p>a. The proposed work to be performed under the following North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code: 712120 - Historical Sites.</p>
<p>b. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Seattle District (NWS) is soliciting and awarding one (1) purchase order.</p>
<p>c. Overview of Project: This is a non-personnel services contract to perform fieldwork to remove headstones, re-excavate and realign pockets, and reinstall, and clean stones. Fieldwork will be performed by field crews under the supervision of a qualified masonry conservator. Data will be informed by site plans, historic photographs, National Register of Historic Places Determination of Eligibility, and the Cemetery Maintenance Plan. The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the services herein. Such contract service providers shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn is responsible to the Government. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the US Government System for Award Management (SAM). Register via the SAM Internet site at https://www.sam.gov Joint ventures must have its own CAGE code and be registered in SAM as a joint venture.</p>
<p>d. Description of Project: Vancouver Post Cemetery was established in 1882. It is the fourth of four cemeteries associated with the Hudson's Bay Company and the US military, and includes some relocated military burials, as well as Native American burials, many of which are marked "unknown." There are also four Medal of Honor recipients buried at the Post cemetery. Most of the markers are the standard government-issue type established during the Civil War era, and consist of plane white marble with curved tops. There are also 159 private markers of varying types and sizes, some of which are sandstone. Approximately 20 of these are less than 50 years of age; 19 are flat headstones. <br />Because the cemetery is eligible for listing in the National Register, the 88th's management of its historic features and objects must comply with Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Part of this obligation requires historic resources to be treated according to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Restoration and Rehabilitation (36 CFR 67). Throughout the years, burial markers have moved out of alignment due to ground disturbance and natural settlement of the slope, resulting in an uneven and non-historic appearance.</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate and assess headstone stability prior to removal.<br />&bull; Ensure precautions are taken for headstones that are vulnerable to damage during removal.<br />&bull; Removal of 900 burials headstones at Fort Vancouver Barracks Cemetery. <br />&bull; Excavation and modification of pocket to alignment with cemetery grid.<br />&bull; Reinstallation of headstones into new realigned pocket.<br />&bull; Clean all 1,442 markers (standard as well as private) with the prescribed cleaning agent to remove stains and biological growth.<br />&bull; Headstone Realignment of an additional 550 headstones at Vancouver Post Cemetery, as needed, in rows to be identified by the COR as requiring additional alignment.</p>
<p>e. Offerors response to this Solicitation limited to 10 pages and shall include the following information: (Clarifications and or questions shall be submitted in a separate word document and will not count towards the 10 page limitation)<br /><br />Completed SF1449&nbsp;with firm fixed price and signature<br /><br />Offerors name, addresses, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.<br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>Technical Capabilities:<br />Technical Acceptability will be evaluated to determine an overall rating. This will be determined by evaluating the ability of the offeror to provide a sound, compliant approach that meets all requirements listed in the Specification and demonstrates a thorough knowledge and understanding of the requirements.

<p>Past Performance:<br />The Government may utilize any references provided by the Contractor, along with information available from past contracts/orders with the USCG and any information found using sources such as Federal Government sources, Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS)/Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to determine if the Contractor has satisfactory or neutral Past Performance. The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror.

For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making). <br />(3) Change Requests do not include replacement work performed pursuant to HSAR 3052.217-92 Inspection and Manner of Doing Work clause or HSAR 3052.217-100 Guarantees clause. <br />(4) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause. <br />(5) Change requests can be transmitted electronically by using email.

Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6,  Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items,  as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a separate written solicitation document will not be issued.

This solicitation is a request for quotations (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular [FAC 2005-95, effective 19 Jan 2017].
The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541611, with a small business size standard of $15 million.
The Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) is seeking the services of a qualified vendor in order to assist the VA in the preparation of the Major Construction Financial Review. Please see the Performance Work Statement and submission instructions below for details.
All interested companies shall provide a quotation for the following:
Services
Evaluation of Offers 
Award shall be made to the offeror whose quote offers the best value to the government, considering technical capability, past performance, and price. The government will evaluate information based on the procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.106-2   Evaluation of Quotations of Offers using the following evaluation criteria: 
1) Technical Evaluation   The evaluation process will consider whether the proposal demonstrates a clear understanding of the technical features involved in meeting the requirements of the solicitation.  
2) Price    The contractor s quote shall include their proposed labor categories, rates and number of hours by task, together with associated delivery dates and sub milestone dates (if any). The Government will evaluate offers by adding all line item prices - the Total of All CLINS will be that sum. 
3) Past Performance   The Vendor s quote must include a summary description of at least three but no more than five prior contracts/orders per team member/sub-contractor for projects completed within the last five years with organizations with similar mission and functional domains, and of comparable size, complexity and scope.  These references must also include:
Contract/Order Number, brief description of the project, type of contract, amount of the contract
Contracting Officer s Name and Phone Number, Government agency
Contracting Officer s Representative Name and Phone Number
The contractor must indicate whether they were the prime contractor, sub-contractor or other teaming arrangement. Prime shall indicate which aspect they are directly responsible for of this requirement. 
The Offeror is required to provide references for the above projects.  In the event the company itself does not have relevant past performance, references may be submitted on contracts performed by the Key Personnel of the company.  The VA reserves the right to contact all the references that the Offeror lists.   
Evaluation Approach
A. All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by Government personnel. The Government intends to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes. However, it may be determined necessary to conduct discussions if award cannot be made on the initial quotes submitted. 
B. All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the evaluation in the most effective manner. The Government reserves the right to evaluate all Offerors  technical quotes should it desire to conduct discussions, or otherwise determine it to be in the Government s best interest. 
C. The quote will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content. Quotes which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient. Offerors who fail to meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.
D. Unbalanced Pricing - The Government may evaluate whether the Offeror has submitted unbalanced pricing. An unbalanced price is one where the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated and which will result in the Government paying an unreasonably high price for contract performance or otherwise present an unacceptable level of risk to the Government. If the Contracting Officer determines that the risk is unacceptable, then the bid or offer can be rejected.

<DESC><p><strong>The Agency has recieved several questions regarding the Service Contract Act wage rates applicable to this contract. To clarify the Government's previous response is as follows. <br /><br />The awardee will be required to compensate its employees in accordance with the Service Contract Act. Wage Determination CBA-2016-9071 applies to the contract and dictates minimum wages payable. While the CBA may expire on August 31, 2019, it is not guaranteed to expire, and, therefore, offerors should submit their proposals with the understanding that the CBA applies to the entire period of performance. Pursuant to the clause at FAR 52.222-43(b), contractors will be required to warrant that the proposed prices do not include any allowances to cover increased costs as a result of anticipated wage determination adjustments. If the CBA WD does expire or change, contractors may be entitled to a price adjustment pursuant to the clause at FAR 52.222-43.<br /><br />***Also, please refer to the&nbsp;attachment titled:&nbsp;BOS RFP Questions &amp; Answers***</strong></p>

<DESC>1. If any shift work occurs (e.g. 7AM-3PM, 3PM-11PM, etc.), this information should be stated in the SOWs.
<p>ANSWER: All ECBC-RI employees are first shift.</p>
<p>2. Provide the total number of FTE, PTE, and contracted personnel working within the scope of the QMS.</p>
<p>ANSWER: ECBC-RI currently has 97 government employees and 17 contracted personnel.</p>
<p>3. State what exclusions, if any, have applied to the current ISO 9001:2008 QMS under Section 7.</p>
<p>ANSWER: No exclusions apply.</p>
<p>4. Clearly state whether RDECOM is currently certified and provide a copy in the SOW/PWS of the current ISO 9001 Certificates of Conformance.<br />These Certificates are not classified and not subject to FOIA. They are public documents. All accredited Certification Bodies (CB) must verify at the time of bidding that the current Certificates have not been suspended or revoked and are free from the threat of suspension and revocation.</p>
<p>ANSWER: ECBC-RI has maintained a continuous certification since December 9th, 2005. Copies of ECBC-RI Certifications will be provided once solicitation has been awarded.</p>
<p>5. Provide a statement indicating the initial date of certification for RDECOM and clearly state whether this certification has been continuous and without interruption since that initial certification date.</p>
<p>ANSWER: See answer to number 4.</p>
<p>6. Provide a statement indicating that RDECOM has in their possession the previous 3 years of audit reports, nonconformances, if any, issued by the current CB, and all corrective actions accepted by the current CB.</p>
<p>ANSWER: ECBC-RI has maintained copies of all previous years audit reports and all applicable information pertaining to all audits.</p>
<p>7. Provide a statement indicating whether RDECOM has in their possession all previously issued Certificates of Conformance to ISO 9001.</p>
<p>ANSWER: See answer to number 4.</p>
<p>8. Clearly state in both SOWs whether RDECOM has been issued a MAJOR nonconformance in the previous three (3) years.</p>
<p>ANSWER: ECBC-RI has never received any major nonconformances.</p>
<p>9. There is no requirement stated in the draft SOWs for auditors. All auditors should be certified by Exemplar Global, IRCA, or BEAC for ISO 9001:2015. Without this requirement, RDECOM may not receive competent and<br />qualified auditors.</p>
<p>ANSWER: The government's Technical Evaluation process will address this.</p>
<p>10. Section 5.1.3 of the PWS states, "All audits shall be in accordance with ISO and ANAB guidance for the purpose of ISO 9001:2015 registration.&nbsp; As part of the audits, the contractor shall conduct reviews of objective evidence to verify conformance to ISO standard. The contractor shall also conduct interviews and other data gathering activities to obtain any additional information as required during the audit." This requirement should be modified to read that "all audits shall be conducted in accordance with ISO 19011 and Accreditation Body requirements." The use of ANAB only is overly restrictive and limits competition. ISO 19011 governs audits and ANAB. Any reference to ANAB in the SOW must also include the equivalent to ANAB such as IAS.</p>
<p>ANSWER: ECBC-RI's current PWS is acceptable and will not be altered.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

(3) The clause at 52.212-5.

(9) The specification.
(t) System for Award Management (SAM).
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Governments reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<BR><BR>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractors SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
(u) Unauthorized Obligations
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractors representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor.

Unenforceability of Unauthorized Obligations (Jun 2013)

(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

(c) Include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in all subcontracts with small business concerns, including subcontracts with small business concerns for the acquisition of commercial items.<BR><BR>a) This contract is subject to 41 U.S.C chapter 71, Contract Disputes.

(c) Claim, as used in this clause, means a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking, as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other relief arising under or relating to this contract. However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71 until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71. The submission may be converted to a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.
(ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim.
(iii) The certification shall state as follows: I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor.<BR><BR>(3) The certification may be executed by any person authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officers decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractors specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment.
