Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE
Construction - Paving Lower Portal Road and Arizona Overlook Improvements (formerly synopsized by a Sources Sought notice under Solicitation number 110118LC)
New Solicitation Number:  R12PS30016
The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends to issue a solicitation for construction on the Lower Portal Road located approximately 8 miles east of Boulder City, Nevada and improvements to the Arizona Overlook Parking Lot located approximately 1 mile east of Hoover Dam.
Project Description:  Construction on the Lower Portal Road will include repaving approximately 1.4 miles of roadway beginning at the security entry gate and ending at the hair pin curve.  Additional work on the Lower Portal Road includes placement of six pre-cast drop structures with interceptor drains crossing the roadway, drainage ditches and collection basins to collect storm runoff, placement of guardrail for safety, a pullout lane to check brakes at the midpoint, and a helicopter landing pad at the Overlook on the Nevada side.
Construction at the Arizona Overlook Parking Lot will include the paving and re-striping of the parking lot and miscellaneous site improvements.  Site improvements include: a) Demolition of existing shade structure and concrete slab; b) Placement of new sidewalks, c) Placement of a drainage structure (scupper); and d) installation of a Government -furnished 24-foot octagonal-shaped shade structure. 
The estimated price range for this construction project is between $1M - $5M.
The construction period is expected to last 150 calendar days.  
This requirement will be a competitive, 100% Set-Aside for HubZone Small Businesses.  
There will be no public bid opening as competitive proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technical Acceptable Source Selection Process and the evaluation criteria included in the solicitation.  The resultant award is expected to be a firm-fixed-price contract.
The construction to be procured is classified in the North American Industry Classification System code 237310, Maintenance, Repair, Alteration of Highways/Roads Bridges, with a size standard of $33.5M.  
The solicitation and any amendments to the solicitation will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) (www.fedbizopps.gov) website.  The extent of the work will be described in the solicitation when it is posted on or about November 1, 2011, under Solicitation number R12PS30016.  
The project period of performance is anticipated to begin on or about January 2, 2012, with an anticipated completion date of May 2012.   All dates in this notice are estimates and are subject to change.  No other information will be available before the solicitation is posted.  
NOTE:The Solicitation will be issued electronically, as will any amendments thereto, in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.5 and 5.102(a)(1); therefore, hard copies will not be provided.  There will not be any printed or hard copies of the Solicitation mailed.  Additionally, most public libraries have resources available to electronically access and download the Solicitation.  Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is in fact unable to maintain a bidders list.  It is therefore, the responsibility of all interested parties to periodically access the above FBO internet address in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued and to ensure that they have the most current information.  Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals may render your proposal nonresponsive and result in rejection of the same.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), intends to award a sole source contract to Sigma-Aldrich, 2931 Soldier Springs Road, Laramie, WY 82070 for the acquisition of custom chemical hydrolysis of 6 PAH epoxide metabolites and isolation and purification of the tetrol products.
<p>The 6 epoxides are: <br />Benz(a)anthracene-trans-8,9-dihydrodiol-10,11-epoxide (anti)<br />Benz(a)anthracene-trans-8,9-dihydrodiol-10,11-epoxide (syn)<br />Benz(a)anthracene-trans-3,4-dihydrodiol-1,2-epoxide (syn)<br />Chrysene-trans-1,2-dihydrodiol-3,4-epoxide (anti)<br />Chrysene-trans-1,2-dihydrodiol-3,4-epoxide (syn)<br />1,2-dihydroxy-3,4-epoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrophenanthrene</p>
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 325199, All Other Basic Organic Chemical Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is 4 months. <br /><br />Sigma-Aldrich RTC is the only company that can provide the custom hydrolysis reactions of these 6 PAH epoxides and subsequent isolation and purification of the tetrol products to meet all of the program requirements including purity, cost and time constraints.</p>
<p>Tobacco smoke contains a large number of toxic chemicals, including large PAHs with 4 or more aromatic rings. These PAHs can be metabolized into tetrol metabolites and excreted in urine. Measurement of these PAH tetrol metabolites could aid researchers to study human exposure to these large PAHs in tobacco smoke and study potential health effects from tobacco smoke. In order to develop methods to measure these metabolites, we need analytical standards for identification and accurate measurement. We have previously purchased 6 PAH epoxides as listed above. These expoxides can be hydrolyzed to yield PAH tetrols. Sigma-Aldrich RTC is the only company that can conduct chemical hydrolysis of these expoxides and purification of the tetrol products in the timeframe that is needed for the FDA tobacco project.</p>
<p>There is no other company that can provide the custom hydrolysis reactions of these 6 PAH epoxides and subsequent isolation and purification of the tetrol products within the required timeframe. The PAH tetrol products will be used in a tobacco project that has specific deliverable requirements within certain times.<br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Sigma-Aldrich. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd VIA E-MAIL ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 99868 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN August 31, 2011.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE ANNOUNCEMENT TO ASCERTAIN WEBSITE ADDRESS TO DOWNLOAD PROJECT DOCUMENTS AND PROJECT DETAILS. This announcement does not constitute the solicitation. Electronic copies of the solicitation will be available to download on the National Business Center website (http://ideasec.nbc.gov) without further notice on or about October 31, 2011. In the solicitation the National Park Service (NPS) will request proposals for the Implementation of the Rocky Intertidal Protocol for the Northeast Temperate Network at Acadia National Park (ACAD), Boston Harbor Island National Recreation Area (BOHA) and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Maine Coastal Islands National Wildlife Refuge (MCI) for the 2012 through 2016 field seasons. National Park managers are directed by federal law to know the status and trends in the condition of natural resources under their stewardship in order to fulfill the National Park Service (NPS) mission of conserving the scenery, and the natural and historic objects and wildlife in national parks unimpaired. In order to fulfill this mission, it is necessary to identify and understand changes in complex, variable and imperfectly understood natural systems and to provide insight into whether observed changes are within natural levels of variability or indicate excessive human influence. The Northeast Temperate Network (NETN) consists of 12 park units in 7 states. One of the long-term monitoring projects undertaken by NETN (and in collaboration with MCI) was rocky intertidal monitoring at ACAD, BOHA, and MCI. Monitoring protocol development began in 2007, and included establishment of 11 monitoring sites and data collection beginning in 2008 (note that only 9 of the sites are slated for regular monitoring). The protocol was completed in 2010, and now NETN and MCI are seeking a contractor with the expertise and capability to implement monitoring. Performance period will be for a base year with four option years. NAICS code 541712. The small business size standard is less than 500 employees. This solicitation is a small business set-aside. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. This solicitation is a Best Value Request for Proposal and offers shall be evaluated on the responses to the following criteria in addition to price: Past performance; soundness of proposal; knowledge, skills and experience of key project personnel; and demonstrated ability to provide published reports or articles. Responses will be due approximately 30 days following issuance of solicitation. The point of contact for this solicitation is Todd Scola, Contract Specialist, National Park Service, Cape Cod National Seashore, Wellfleet, MA. E-mail address is todd_scola@nps.gov and the telephone is 508-957-0709.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-08-G-0012 to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NGC) for the support of the AN/ALR-67(V)2 Radar Warning Receiver, hereafter referred to as the AN/ALR-67(V)2. The requirements to be procured consist of Shop Replaceable Assembly (SRA) components: Linear Amplifier (Part Number (P/N) 82-055742-01), Bit Generator (P/N 63-054921-01), and Dual Multiplier (P/N 82-054691-02) for sustainment of the AN/ALR-67(V)2 installations on F/A-18 A-D and AV-8B aircraft. The procurement will require the contractor to coordinate with sub-vendors to accomplish efforts related to the verification or validation of parts compatibility as required for this specific application; provide technical assistance to the Government; provide technical data and specifications for the newly acquired components; and verify that the parts meet the original manufacturer's specifications on all performance parameters.
<p>Litton Industries is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the AN/ALR-67(V)2 Radar Warning Receiver. In 2001 NGC acquired Litton Industries. NGC has therefore assumed all ownership and responsibility as the original designer, developer, and manufacturer of the AN/ALR-67(V)2.</p>
<p>NGC became the only firm with the knowledge, expertise, in-depth experience, technical data, AN/ALR-67(V)2 production tooling, special tools, and test equipment required for the AN/ALR-67(V)(2) SRA components. A technical data package suitable for competition does not exist for these requirements and to attempt to develop such package could result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Navy's requirements.</p>

Andersen at (310) 332-2699 or email Richard.J.Andersen@ngc.com. Reference Synopsis Number 20001-12. NAICS Code 334511.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis for Design-Build Contract for New A-Wing Annex at the RTP Main Campus

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for the design and construction of a three-story office building addition to its facility in Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina.  The gross area for this planned building is estimated at 51,300 - 74,200 square feet.  The project will be designed and constructed toward achieving a LEED New Construction certification.  The estimated design-build price is under $10 million, and the anticipated period of performance is 24 months after contract award.  
The design-build scope of work includes architectural, engineering, construction, security, and other related services such as site work and site utilities, permitting, testing, and inspection during construction.  In addition to office space, the new building will house a tissue archive freezer farm, a room for electronic data storage silos, and storage space for scientific equipment.  The project will also include a landscaped exterior courtyard. 
This procurement is being conducted using the two-phase design-build selection procedures set forth in FAR Subpart 36.3.  A single solicitation shall be issued covering both phases.  Proposals will be evaluated in Phase 1 to determine which offerors will submit proposals for Phase 2.  Phase 1 evaluation factors will include technical approach (but not detailed design or technical information), and technical qualifications, including past performance.  After evaluating Phase 1 proposals, the Contracting Officer shall select the most highly qualified offerors (not to exceed three) and request that only those  shortlisted offerors submit Phase 2 proposals. 
Phase 2 of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15, and shall include Phase 2 evaluation factors developed in accordance with FAR 15.304 and FAR 36.303-2.   Phase 2 shall require submission of technical and price proposals by the three shortlisted offerors.  All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.
A single firm-fixed-price, design-build contract will be awarded using FAR Part 15 procedures.   The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220.  All responsible sources may submit a Phase 1 proposal, which will be considered by EPA.  It is expected that Phase 1 of the solicitation will be posted on the Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD) Contracts website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/  on or about November 16, 2011.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Description: The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey, on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager, Maneuver Ammunition Systems (PM-MAS), is  seeking possible sources to develop, test, qualify and produce initial quantities of high and low velocity grenade 40mm Non-Dud Producing Day/Night Training Cartridges. The desired training cartridges provide an impact signature that is visible to the human eye during both daylight and nighttime, and is visible through current night sights (including night vision and infrared sights) while not generating unexploded ordnance. High Velocity (HV) non-dud training cartridges should be seen by currently fielded sights used with the Mk19 Mod 3 Grenade Machine Gun.  Low Velocity (LV)  non-dud training cartridges should be seen by currently fielded sights used with the M203/ M320 weapon systems. HV 40mm training cartridge will be interoperable and fired from the Mk19 Mod 3 Grenade Machine Gun. LV 40mm training cartridge will be interoperable and fired from M203 and M320 grenade launchers.  Specifications:  A draft version of the performance specification for the 40mm HV Non-Dud Producing Training Cartridge will be available upon request. To request the performance specification, the requestor must be a DoD contractor and registered in an active status in the Defense Logistics Information Service, U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (See www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for instructions and information). Offerors should submit their certification via DD Form 2345 or register immediately. An offeror's delay in doing so will not be a basis to extend the closing date of this market survey. The performance specification has been labeled Distribution Statement F: Further dissemination only as directed by SFAE-AMO -MAS, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ,07806-5000, or higher DoD authority. Reproduction requires approval of originator, SFAE-AMO-MAS, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, 07806- 5000 or higher DoD authority. As such, interested companies will be required to return/destroy the performance specification when requested by the Government. A performance specification is being drafted for the LV non-dud producing cartridge, but is currently not available.  Offerors are free to discuss how the low velocity concepts would be different from high velocity concepts.
 Planned Acquisition: The Government envisions making multiple awards in the FY13 timeframe with a down select to occur prior to low rate initial production, which would begin approximately at the end of FY14. Any resulting contract may contain up to two options for production. The contract type will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP). The primary outcomes of this effort are the qualification of a training cartridges and obtaining Government Purpose rights to the technical data for the cartridges.  The Government intends to use the technical data package as a basis for future procurements. The Government requests that Offerors submit information regarding data rights and Offeror requirements for the Government to obtain those rights.
 Submission Information: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION. Please be advised that the Government will not pay for any information submitted under this announcement. Interested companies should submit their qualifications and capabilities electronically within 30 days of this notice to: US Army Contracting Command- New Jersey, ACC-NJ-MA, William Labance, Bldg 45B, Mailstop 10B, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 or by email to: william.labance@us.army.mil.

This is not a Solicitation Announcement, or Request for Proposal/Quotation.  This notice does not constitute any commitment by the Government, nor will it result in a subsequent award. The purpose is solely to conduct market research to gain knowledge of potentially qualified sources. Responses to this Sources Sought Notice will be used by the Government to establish an appropriate acquisition decision. The IRS will not award a contract on the basis of responses or pay for the preparation of any information submitted. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this notice. After completing an analysis of the responses, the Government will determine whether to limit competition to 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, or small business firms, or to proceed with issuing an unrestricted solicitation, inviting full and open competition.

<DESC><p>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) Scott Field Office will issue a sole source modification to contract HC1013-09-D-2000 for First Air Force-Air Forces Northern (1 AF-AFNORTH), Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, and the 611th Air Communications Squadron (611 ACOMS) at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska (on behalf of PACAF and Eleventh Air Force). The current contract contains Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity for maintenance, with Fixed Price, Time and Materials delivery orders for system changes. The current contract was competitively awarded to General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), Inc.</p>
<p>HC1013-09-D-2000 supports the mission of maintaining command and control of airspace defense, air sovereignty and supporting Homeland Defense/Security and law enforcement efforts in counter-narco-terrorism for the United States, Canada and their respective states, territories and provinces, to include those in the Pacific and Caribbean. North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM, or NORTHCOM) are tasked for North America. Commander, NORAD (CDRNORAD)/Commander USNORTHCOM requires mission performance on a 24 hours a day, seven days a week (24/7) basis. The Hawaii Air National Guard and Guam Air National Guard are tasked for Pacific area air defense 24/7. Command and Control (C2) consists of processing data, voice and other sensor and information inputs into capability commanders utilize to direct assets in the prosecution of the mission.</p>
<p>This sole source modification will task GDIT to implement one new requirement; a Voice Console Replacement System. <br />The current voice console systems in operation at five geographically separate locations, Eastern Battle Control Center (BCC), Western BCC, CONUS NORAD Region (CONR) Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC), Alaska NORAD Region (ANR) Air Defense Sector (ADS) and the Hawaii Region AOC (HIRAOC) will be completely removed and replaced with a new system. The voice console system provides access to telephone lines and radios. All radios used by the ADSs, BCCs and AOCs are accessed using the voice console system, making it the single and only way to communicate with aircraft. <br />Any interested party may submit a proposal for this effort to the attention of the Contracting Officer. The proposal must describe how the interested party will meet the Single System Manger and Contractor Offline Facility requirements of the statement of work. In addition, the interested party needs to describe how they will integrate a new VCRS into the five geographically separate locations, fit it within the existing architecture and physical space and also ensure the existing systems remain fully operational with no loss or decrease in operational availability.. In accordance with Federal Acquisiton Regulation 5.203(c), the closing date for proposals is established as 1700 hours, Central Daylight Savings Time, XX October 2011.</p>
<p>The DITCO Contracting Officer is Arthur Kruse, 618-229-9773, e-mail: arthur.kruse@disa.mil.</p>

<a href="mailto:gayle.e.rouse@mvn02.usace.army.mil">USACE District, New Orleans</a>
<DESC>The New Orleans District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (MVN) is hosting a Debris Industry Forum on November 2, 2011.  <br><br>Purpose:  The purpose of this Debris Forum is to discuss lessons learned, solicit feedback from industry on proposed changes to the Advanced Contracting Initiative (ACI) Debris Contracts, and demonstrate new technology to improve our response to future disasters.  The forum will give interested vendors an opportunity to improve the acquisition process, and provide up-to-date information on the upcoming solicitation. This forum will be held at the New Orleans Marriott, 555 Canal Street, New Orleans, LA  70130-2300, Acadia Room.  The exact time and specific details will be at the following web site:  http://www.mvn.usace.army.mil/ebs/debris/index.asp.  <br><br>Background:  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is authorized to respond to disasters under public law 93-288, Robert T. Stafford Act.  The National Response Framework (NRF) identifies lead and supporting agencies, roles and responsibilities for responding to incidents of National Significance.  The NRF identifies joint leadership roles between the Department of Defense (DoD) and FEMA for executing the Emergency Support Function (ESF) #3, Public Works and Engineering.  FEMA issues mission assignments to DoD who in-turn delegates ESF #3 mission execution to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Existing Contracts:  In order to execute ESF #3, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers implemented the Advance Contract Initiative (ACI).  There are ACI contracts for ice, water, power, debris, and roofing.  MVN is the lead District for the existing ACI Debris contracts.  Presently, there are ten (10) Regions and three (3) MATOC Pools.  <br><br>Upcoming Re-Competition:  The existing contracts are entering their final contract year.  MVN will  issue a solicitation for new ACI contracts in the near future.    If you are interested in attending this forum, you must pre-register with the web site listed above.  Space is limited and we will be accepting interested firms on a first come, first serve basis.  You must register before October 26, 2011 to attend this forum. <br><br>Special Note:  In addition to attending the industry day, all interested companies are invited to submit a Capability Statement consisting of appropriate documentation, literature and brochures and should include:  1) Firm name, address, telephone and fax numbers.  2) Identification of the company as a Small Business with proper certification (NAICS Code 562119 business size standard is not to exceed $11,500,000).  3) Past experience with debris removal operations.  4) Letter from bonding agency indicating your performance and payment bond capacity.  (5) List of existing teaming agreements in place with other businesses.<br><br>IMPORTANT:  Responses must be limited to no more than 10 pages.  Submission of a Capabilities Statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Corps in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is neither to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents WILL NOT be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Statements that do not meet all requirements or submitted within the allotted time will not be considered.  Electronic submissions will be accepted.  The responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT synopsis may be e-mailed to the POC listed for this special notice.  Responses must be received no later than 4:30pm Central, Friday, November 4, 2011.<br><br>NOTE:  Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DOD activity.  Information on registration may be obtained by calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Registration requires applicants to have a DUNS number from Dun & Bradstreet.  Recommend registering immediately in order to be eligible for timely award.<br><br>If you have any questions, please contact the individuals listed below: <br><br>Gayle Rouse at 504-862-1547 Gayle.E.Rouse@usace.army.mil or <br>Tim Black at 504-862-2918 or Tim.Black@usace.army.mil <br><br>

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District is seeking small business sources for a construction project entitled: Lower Granite Trash Shear Boom Repair.  The work is located at the Lower Granite Lock and Dam located in Garfield County, Washington.  This will be a firm-fixed-price construction contract.  Construction magnitude is between $500,000 and $1,000,000, and 100% performance and payment bonds will be required.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 237990 and the associated small business size standard is $33,500,000.  <br><br>This sources-sought announcement is a tool to identify businesses with the capability to accomplish the work.

Your response to this notice must be received on or before 3:00PM on October 24, 2011.<br><br>Summary of Scope of Work:<br><br>General: The Lower Granite Trash Shear Boom is a floating structure in the forebay of Lower Granite Dam that was designed to direct floating trash and debris away from the powerhouse turbine intakes.  The boom consists of 5 spans held in position by four intermediate floats.  Each intermediate float is held in place by two anchors-one on the upstream side and one on the downstream side, with a chain/wire rope/hardware system linking the anchors to the intermediate float.<br><br>Current Conditions:  The condition of the Trash Shear Boom Anchorage System is a concern because some existing wire ropes have broken and had to be replaced temporarily with poly ropes tied off to the existing shore anchors.  One of the upstream anchor lines that had broken previously was replaced in the winter of 2006-2007. It is anticipated that anchor and anchor line should be in good condition for another 20 to 25 years.  This scope of this contract will be to replace the remaining seven anchors/anchor line systems that are still original equipment or are presently tied off to shore anchors.  If the trash boom were to come loose from its anchorage, it could end up lodged in either the Spillway Weir surface passage or the turbine intakes.<br><br>Construction Contract: Using government furnished property-10,000 to 18,000 pound stockless anchors, wire rope, chain, and miscellaneous hardware-assemble the anchorage lines and set the anchors in the river bottom, and connect anchorage lines to the existing intermediate floats to hold the trash shear boom in place.<br><br>Additional tasks for this contract include:<br>1. Using government furnished property, install three upstream and four downstream anchors, anchor lines, and hardware to keep the floating trash shear boom in position in the forebay of Lower Granite Dam. <br>2. Shorten the first span of longitudinal wire rope cable to approximately 10-20 feet.<br>3. Remove existing and install new (GFP or contractor provided?) backstrap.<br>4. Re-install chain from trash shear boom floats to the 2-inch mainline.<br>5. Inspect boat access and replace wire rope cables from the frame to the floats.<br>6. Inspect 2-inch main line on entire trash shear boom.<br><br>The contract activities will require support of a barge mounted crane, a dive tender, and various work boats and/or barges.  Shore crews shall assemble the anchorage lines onshore for installation by marine crews.  Many of the tasks must be performed or supported by dive crews.  Most dives will be in the range from the water surface to depths of 20 feet, but a few deep dives up to 120 foot depths will be required.  Construction is restricted to the Snake River in-water work window (January 1 through March 1, 2012) and will most likely take place in inclement weather.  Safety will be a concern with crane lifts of heavy items; icy conditions; work over water; and work in the forebay of Lower Granite Dam upstream of turbine intakes, conventional spillway gates, and the Spillway Weir surface passage.<br><br>Additionally, the contractor will be required to provide a Project Superintendent, Quality Control Manager, and Site Safety and Health Officer.  The Project Superintendent will not be allowed to perform the duties of either the Quality Control Manager or the Site Safety and Health Officer.  However, one person could perform the duties of both the Quality Control Manager and the Site Safety and Health Officer.  The person/persons assigned to those positions must meet the following requirements:<br><br>Quality Control Manager-<br>1. A minimum of 5 years experience as a Quality Control Manager on similar projects requiring over-water work.<br>2. Completion of the "Construction Quality Management for Contractors" course within the last 5 years.<br><br>Site Safety and Health Officer-<br><br>1. A minimum of 5 years safety work experience on similar projects. <br>2. Completion of the 30-hour OSHA construction safety class or equivalent within the last 5 years.<br>3. Completion of an average of at least 24 hours of formal safety training each year for the past 5 years.<br>4. Competent person training as needed<br>

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (VHA)
Office of Informatics and Analytics (OIA)
Emerging Health Technology

INTRODUCTION:

This sources sought notice is for market research purposes in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. It does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be considered as a commitment by the Government. This sources sought notice is a Request for Information (RFI) before the release of any resultant solicitation. This is not a request for a proposal and does not guarantee the release of any solicitation.
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for an emerging health technology report for the Office of Informatics and Analytics (OIA). At this time, no solicitation exists. Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.

BACKGROUND:

The VA gathered data in a field evaluation of speech to text software in September 2011 from 8 participants in the subject user group.  There is one feedback form for each participant which contains the following information: 

-	Demographic information;
-	Technical configuration information;
-	Free form text answers to open-ended questions;
-	Likert scale answers to questions/statements;
 
In addition to the feedback form, for each participant the following: 
-	Time on task, expressed as minutes and seconds, for speed of data entry using both a keyboard and S2T input; 
-	Accuracy measurements for correctness of data entered expressed as a count of minor errors, a count of major errors, and a count of corrected mistakes* 

The VA will electronically scan the completed participant feedback forms from the subject user group and will send to the contractor.  The VA will perform an analysis of the "free form" text data, as well as of the participant comments in the face to face interviews.  The VA will provide findings from the analysis to the contractor for inclusion in the report.  After the contractor has received all evaluation information, a conference call will be conducted with the VA as an opportunity for review and clarification.  

OBJECTIVES:  

The contractor shall summarize the findings provided by the VA into the Point of Care report format, categorizing the results into performance value areas (e.g. clinician productivity, clinician satisfaction and such).  The contractor shall include in the summary of findings all data cited above (i.e., Likert scale, free-form text, time in minutes and seconds, accuracy expressed as number of errors). The report shall include information on the three components defined in the Point of Care methodology as relevant to assessing information technology: clinician role, health care setting and tasks performed.  Due to the one-on-one style of the evaluation and the relatively small number of participants, the findings shall be qualitative in nature (not quantitative).  Therefore the tone of the written report shall reflect these qualitative findings and, for example, minimize the use of bar charts which are more suited for a quantitative evaluation style.

Report of data collected in the Speech to Text software field evaluation.

SUBMITTAL INFORMATION:
Interested parties shall furnish the following minimum information:
1.	Company name and address;
2.	Company point of contact name, telephone number and email address;
3.	Company business size and status (i.e., Large Business, Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Women-Owned Small Business, etc.), the number of years in business, affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners;
4.	If the company holds a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Contract, list the GSA Contract Number and relevant SINS;
5.	Capabilities/Qualifications: A written response providing clear and unambiguous evidence to substantiate the capacity to fulfill this requirement. Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possesses to perform services described in the scope of work; and, 

6. 	Past Experience. Brief summary of the company history relative to similar requirements. Offer may provide the following information on a maximum of three similar projects for which the responder was a prime or subcontractor:
a.	The name, address, and value of each project
b.	The Prime Contract Type, Firm Fixed-Price, or Time and Material
c.	The name, telephone and address of the owner of each project
d.	A description of each project and why it is relevant to this requirement. Include difficulties and successes
e.	Your company's role and services provided for each project.
It is requested that the above information be provided no later than October 20, 2011 at 12:00PM EST. Responses should be emailed to Merrie Frost at Merrie.Frost@va.gov.  All Email Correspondence for this project must reference the RFI Number, Project Identifier and Project Title in the subject line of the email. 

This notice does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response is not a request that will be considered for contract award. All interested parties will be required to respond to the resultant solicitation separately from their response to this sources sought notice.

SOURCES SOUGHT

Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
Office of Health Information (OHI)
Concept of Operations (CONOPS)

1.	 Introduction:
This sources sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced and interested potential sources. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be incurred by interested parties in responding to this sources sought announcement.
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for Office of Health Information (OHI). At this time, no solicitation exists. Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.

2.	 Background / Introduction: The purpose of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Health Information (OHI) Enterprise Systems Management (ESM) Office is to work collaboratively with other OHI components and VHA Program Offices to develop, implement and monitor comprehensive portfolios of Information Technology (IT) systems. This includes the coordination of IT life cycle management for all VHA IT systems and portfolios. The ESM Office functions as a matrix organization to identify and work through cross cutting issues, and to maximize OHI and Program Office resources in support of the IT portfolios of systems. The ESM office has five major enterprise portfolios supporting VHA requirements.  They include:

a.	Health Data Systems                                                             
b.	Health Provider Systems                                                                      
"	Management & Financial Systems                                                              
"	Registration, Eligibility & Enrollment Systems 
"	Joint Interoperability Ventures

Additionally, the ESM office has four ancillary cross cutting services as follows:
"	Business Architecture Office (BA)
"	Requirements Analysis and Engineering Management (RAEM)
"	Program Integration (PI) Service
"	Common Services (CS)

A major responsibility of ESM is to define business requirements for development of VHA IT systems.  The ESM Office has several focus areas related to requirements elicitation including:
"	Work with customers to define accurate and appropriate functional requirements.
"	Present business requirements for technical development and implementation to governing bodies and assist with prioritization.
"	Serve as a broker between VHA clinical, business and IT communities to ensure business requirements are identified, communicated, understood and translated into IT investments that meet clinical and business needs.
"	Gather, document, analyze and evaluate clinical and business requirements.

One method used to document and communicate business needs is through the development of Concepts of Operations (CONOPS), which are utilized to help VHA customers better express their business needs in terms of the capabilities they require.  A concept of operations:

"	Articulates the vision stakeholders and users have on what operations and support should look like in the future
"	Is process focused and system agnostic - focusing on performance and capability requirements, not on the details of an IT implementation
"	May ultimately result in modified business processes that better support the needs of the VHA customer

3.	Scope of Work:   The contractor shall develop CONOPS documents.  These CONOPS shall incorporate business requirements necessary to guide development of VHA IT systems which will best serve the veteran and meet VHA stakeholder needs.  A CONOPS is a document describing the characteristics of a proposed IT need from the viewpoint of an individual who will use that system. It is used to communicate the quantitative and qualitative system characteristics to all stakeholders.  The CONOPS evolves from a concept and will provide a description of how a set of capabilities may be employed to achieve desired strategic objectives or a particular end state for a specific scenario or IT need.  The required outputs (CONOPS) shall document the current (as-is) business environment, the desired (to-be) business environment, and potential gaps between the current and desired environments to produce a final CONOPS document.  The template to be used by the contractor for each CONOPS initiative is included as attachment A.  A PowerPoint presentation describing the purpose of CONOPS for VHA is included as attachment B.

4.	 Submittal Information:
Contractors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements should submit a response of no more than 5 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum. The Government will not review any other data, attachments that are in excess to the 5 pages. Companies should provide clear and unambiguous evidence to substantiate their capability to fulfill these requirements.
Interested parties shall furnish the following minimum information:
1.	Company name and address
2.	Company point of contact name, telephone number and email address
3.	Company business size and status (i.e., Large Business, Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Women-Owned Small Business, etc.), the number of years in business, affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners
4.	If the company holds a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Contract, list the GSA Contract Number and relevant SINS
5.	Capabilities/Qualifications: A written response providing clear and unambiguous evidence to substantiate the capacity to fulfill this requirement. Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possesses to perform services described in the scope of work.
 
6. Past Experience: Brief summary of the company history relative to similar requirements. Offer may provide the following information on a maximum of three similar projects for which the responder was a prime or subcontractor.
a.	The name, address, and value of each project
b.	The Prime Contract Type, Firm Fixed-Price, or Time and Material
c.	The name, telephone and address of the owner of each project
d.	A description of each project and why it is relevant to this requirement. Include difficulties and successes
e.	Your company's role and services provided for each project.
It is requested that the above information be provided no later than October 26, 2011 at 1:00PM EST. Responses should be emailed Andrea Fink atAndrea.Fink@va.gov. All Email  Correspondence for this project must reference the RFI Number, Project Identifier and Project Title in the subject line of the email.

<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-01-389-2262<br />Name: Self Stick Rectangular Flag, "Sign Here", 1.0" X 1.75", Yellow, 100 Flags per pack<br />Description: Self stick rectangular flag with "Sign Here." 1.0" X 1.75", Yellow, 100 Flags per pack. UOI is PG. PG = 100 Flags.</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-01-410-7012<br />Name: Self Stick Rectangular Flag, "Initial Here", 1.0" x 1.75", Blue, 100 flags per pack<br />Description: Self stick rectangular flag with "Initial Here." 1.0" x 1.75", Blue, 100 flags per pack. UOI is PG. PG = 100 Flags.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-01-389-2262<br />Similar Items: MMM680SH2, SPR19257, MMM68052SH, MMM68052YW</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-01-410-7012<br />Similar Items: MMM680IH2</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than October 28, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) National Institutes of Health (NIH) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a), FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items, and U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation, Rued Langgaards Vej 7, 5te, 5A56, 2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark, for a multi-year contract as defined by FAR Part 17 Multi-Year Contracts (specifically, FAR Part 17.104, Part 17.105, &amp; Part 17.106) . The contract will provide NLM with at least twice-yearly updates to the English and Spanish versions of SNOMED CT, originally developed by the College of American Pathologists, and a license to incorporate SNOMED CT updates into the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus (National Library of Medicine registered trademarks); to use SNOMED CT within the UMLS Metathesaurus for research purposes within the NLM, in NLM's production data creation systems, and in its publicly accessible retrieval systems; and to redistribute SNOMED CT, within the UMLS Metathesaurus or otherwise, free-of-charge to U.S. entities for use within the U.S. for any health care, public health, research, educational, or statistical purposes. SNOMED CT is a comprehensive, multi-axial, controlled terminology intended for use in patient, public health, and research data.
<p>SNOMED CT has been recommended as a U.S. standard by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, has been adopted as a U.S.-government wide standard by the interagency Consolidated Health Informatics Initiative, and was incorporated as part of several U.S. Interoperability Specifications released by the Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel under contract to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, Department of Health and Human Services. In 2009, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, part of the American Recovery and Revitalization Act, established the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology in law; created two new federal advisory committees, the Health Information Technology Policy Committee and the Health Information Technology Standards Committee, to advise the National Coordinator and the Secretary of Health and Human Services on matters related to standardization, certification, adoption and implementation of electronic health record (EHR) systems; and established programs to encourage the meaningful use of EHRs by health professionals and hospitals that serve the Medicare and Medicaid populations. Upon the advice of both advisory committees, SNOMED CT was designated as a national standard for several purposes (problem list, public health reporting) in the initial certification criteria for EHRs issued by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. Recent recommendations from the two advisory committees have proposed that SNOMED CT be the U.S. national standard for additional categories of information in EHRs and for additional health information exchange transactions. SNOMED CT has been chosen as the standard for selected data elements in international genetic information resources, including a Genetic Testing Registry and database of clinically significant human variations under development at NIH. It is also being used in an increasing number of clinical research studies.</p>
<p>In June 2003, NLM entered into a 5-year contract with the College of American Pathologists to obtain updates to SNOMED CT under similar license terms. The College of American Pathologists announced its intention to transfer their intellectual property in SNOMED CT to the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation in early 2007 (reference FAR 52.217-2 Cancellation with respect to contract cancellation), at which time NLM established a 4.5 year contract with the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation under similar license terms.</p>
<p>SNOMED CT is a proprietary product originally owned by the College of American Pathologists, which has developed successive versions of the terminology over the past 35 years. In April 2007 the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation acquired the intellectual property rights to SNOMED CT and all previous versions of the terminology from the College of American Pathologists. Since SNOMED CT is a proprietary product of the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation, NLM has determined that the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation is the only source capable of providing the software and the ongoing software updates. Responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine. This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available. Please refer to Numbered Note 22.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please contact Suet Vu at (301) 496-6546 or by email at vus@mail.nlm.nih.gov. Collect calls will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) invites potential&nbsp;offerors to provide an industry perspective to the TRICARE Overseas Program (TOP) so that the structure of the next generation of the TOP health care support services contract may be developed to reflect best practices and innovative solutions to military health care challenges in the overseas environment.&nbsp; Input and information may be provided in writing or through one-on-one meetings (in person or via teleconference) with TMA. One-on-one meetings are intended to allow full disclosure in an environment that protects any information shared. The one-on-one meetings will be held face-to-face at the TMA offices in Aurora, Colorado; and will occur between December 1, 2011 and December 16, 2011. If you are interested in providing input into the future of the military health care system through the services provided under the TOP contract, please contact Ms. Angie Figueroa, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at angie.figueroa@tma.osd.mil no later than November 18, 2011 to make arrangements for a one-on-one meeting. If a face-to-face meeting is not feasible, teleconference calls or submission of written information will be permitted. The Government reserves the right to limit the size, content, and format of written information. Participation in this Industry Forum is voluntary and in no way obligates the Government to award any contracts, or pay any costs associated with such participation.</p>
<p>Overview: The Defense Health Program (DHP) offers worldwide health care to eligible beneficiaries via the direct care and purchased care systems. Direct care is provided by DoD personnel in Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and clinics, and purchased care is provided via four TRICARE regional contracts. In the 50 United States and the District of Columbia, three Managed Care Support Contractors provide purchased care contract services in the North, South, and West regions. Outside the 50 United States and the District of Columbia, purchased care is provided via the TOP contract. This overview describes, in general terms, the purchased care portion of the DHP as it relates to the TRICARE Overseas Program. Additional information is available on the TRICARE Management Activity World Wide Web site at www.tricare.osd.mil.</p>
<p>In order to fulfill the purchased care needs of the DHP, potential&nbsp;offerors must provide certain services necessary to fully support DoD's primary wartime readiness mission while supplementing the services provided through DoD owned and/or operated health care facilities. Information from potential offerors&nbsp;should address providing clinical and administrative health care support services that are comparable to the best offered in the host nation civilian community and/or U.S. standards (including U.S. commonwealths and territories) and fulfilling the objectives complying with the scope and structure of TRICARE; i.e., benefits and beneficiary liabilities, including technical requirements specified under the TRICARE uniform health care benefit. Information must address the expertise of health care organizations and health benefit administrators in incorporating and operating the best business model and practices of the private sector in support of DoD healthcare delivery. Any contractor selected for contract award will have to provide the DoD with clinical and administrative services that are comparable to the best offered in the host nation civilian community and/or U.S. practices (including U.S. commonwealths and territories). Information is sought to assure that the services will be delivered in a manner that achieves a fully integrated health care delivery and financing system for all Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Current Status of the Defense Health Program (DHP): The medical mission of the Department of Defense is to maintain readiness through health and medical services provided to the armed forces during military operations, and to provide health and medical services/support to the members of the armed forces, their family members and other entitled to DoD health care. The MHS must be prepared not only to provide a high quality, cost-effective health care benefit to its eligible members during peacetime, but also must be prepared to support the armed forces during exercises, contingencies, operations other than war, and in wartime.</p>
<p>In support of its readiness mission, the MHS maintains a system of MTFs and clinics worldwide, located in DoD catchment areas, that provide direct care to active duty personnel and to others who are eligible for military health benefits if space is available. Although the number and size of direct care facilities has declined in recent years, it remains important that MTFs are optimized in order to maintain the clinical skills of military clinical staff to support medical readiness. Currently, the direct care system cannot fully support the total demand for health care services; therefore, TRICARE uses the direct care system as the main delivery system, and through the awarding of the TOP contract overseas, augments the direct care system through civilian network and non-network providers and facilities serving its eligible members.</p>
<p>The MHS is organized into three TRICARE areas overseas: TRICARE Pacific; TRICARE Latin America and Canada (TLAC), and TRICARE Eurasia-Africa. TOP services apply to approximately 378,000 Active Duty Service Members (ADSMs) and command sponsored Active Duty Family Members (ADFMs) of the Uniformed Services overseas: the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Marines Corps, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service and the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. These beneficiaries are eligible for the TOP Prime or TOP Prime Remote option (command-sponsored ADFMs may also choose to use the TRICARE Standard option). Additionally, TOP services apply to approximately 118,000 non-command sponsored ADFMs, retirees, and retiree family members. These beneficiaries are only eligible for the TRICARE Standard option. These options are discussed in more detail below. There is no TRICARE Extra option overseas.</p>
<p>TOP Prime and TOP Prime Remote are similar to a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) with a Point of Service option and requires beneficiary enrollment. TOP enrollees receive all primary care from a Primary Care Manager (PCM), who may be located at the MTF or may be a civilian provider in the TOP contractor's provider network. Enrollees must obtain an authorization from the TOP contractor prior to receiving any non-emergency health care in the civilian community. All ADSMs permanently assigned overseas are required to enroll in TOP Prime or TOP Prime Remote, although they are required to receive all of their care either in the MTF or in the civilian community under special rules that apply to Active Duty healthcare. Command sponsored ADFMs&nbsp; may elect to enroll and are not required to pay an annual enrollment fee or co-pays for care delivered in the network or the direct care system. TRICARE Standard is a fee-for-service option in which the beneficiary is free to use any authorized provider. The two options of TRICARE are described fully in 32 CFR Part 199.17 and 199.18 which may be accessed on the TRICARE Management Activity World Wide Web site at www.tricare.osd.mil. <br /><br />Currently, the TOP contractor is required to establish civilian provider networks (augmented by non-network providers, as necessary to ensure access to care) in all MTF locations and designated remote overseas locations. Networks are sized to accommodate the enrolled population only.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) requires delivery of a uniform health care benefit in the form of uniform healthcare quality, structure and patient cost-sharing. However, DoD is also interested in taking advantage of the expertise of the civilian sector and incorporating best practices in the overseas health care market.</p>
<p>Proposed Contract Performance Objectives: A world-class health system that supports the military mission by fostering, protecting, sustaining and restoring health is our vision for fulfilling the MHS mission. To enhance DoD and our Nation's security by providing health support for the full range of military operations and sustaining the health of all those entrusted to our care. As noted above, this is accomplished through an integrated health care delivery system consisting of our military hospitals and clinics, as well as, services purchased in the civilian sector. The TRICARE Program is accomplishing this mission today through the TOP contract that contains the following contract objectives. These Objectives are not listed by order of importance.</p>
<p>Objective 1: Timely and accurate processing of all TRICARE claims that fall within the scope of the contract, to include full compliance with TRICARE's requirements for development, processing, medical review, authorization, and data record submission.</p>
<p>Objective 2: Beneficiary and provider satisfaction at the highest level possible throughout the period of performance, through the delivery of world-class health care as well as customer friendly program services.</p>
<p>Objective 3: Development and management of host nation provider networks (complemented by non-network providers) capable of providing access to the full range of TRICARE covered benefits and services, to include (but not limited to) medical/surgical benefits, mental health services, durable medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, and dental care (for remote active duty service members). Host nation network providers shall be certified in accordance with recognized licensure/certification/ medical malpractice insurance standards for their location.</p>
<p>Objective 4: Provision of administrative, management, and customer support services, to include appropriate staffing levels, incorporating commercial practices when practicable to ensure efficient and effective management of all aspects of the contract.</p>
<p>Objective 5: Fully operational services and systems at the start of health care delivery with minimal disruption to beneficiaries, providers, and MTFs.</p>
<p>These objectives are subject to change in the next TOP contract. Potential sources may have more contemporary information on the proper objectives for achieving our vision and mission while clearly focusing on measurable, high quality clinical and administrative services achieved in the most cost efficient manner for the American taxpayer. The Government is interested in any information potential&nbsp;offerors would like to address in support of achieving high quality, cost effective delivery of health care services overseas. We are also very interested in the industry's thoughts concerning performance requirements. Requirements in this setting represent performance that must occur at or exceed specified performance standards and that achieves outcome based objectives identified in a contract. Examples of TRICARE performance standards may be found in the TRICARE Operations Manual at www.tricare.mil. TMA is very interested in the industry's assessment of the existing performance standards and suggestions for new, revised, and or completely changed performance standards.</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;there are legislative limitations and recommendations conflicting with statutes may not be able to be implemented. However, any of the administrative requirement changes which support a more efficient TRICARE Overseas&nbsp;Program may be acceptable for information presentation. The regulations, TRICARE Operations Manual, TRICARE Policy Manual, TRICARE Systems Manual, and TRICARE Reimbursement Manual are all requirements of the TRICARE Program and uniform benefit. These are available for review at www.tricare.mil and may provide insight to potential sources.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a Sole Source procurement action and is not a request for proposals.

The National Cemetery Administration, Philadelphia, PA, intends to award a 100% Small Business Set-Aside Firm Fixed Price Contract consisting of a Base Year and Four Option Years to provide all labor, equipment, parts, materials, supplies, and transportation necessary for the Start-up and Shut-down Maintenance Services for a government owned Irrigation System at the Saratoga National Cemetery in Schuylerville, NY, to Pro Tech Auto Lawn Sprinklers, Inc. (CAGE 68ZL3).

This determination is being made under FAR 6.302-1, that only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy this requirement, because Market Research conducted by the Cemetery for the local New York counties around Albany and Saratoga over the past several years has been unsuccessful in identifying other, competing sources for these services that could be performed at a Fair and Reasonable Price.

All Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Veteran Owned Small Businesses, and Small Businesses who wish to challenge this sole source determination must submit an interest letter that demonstrates your capability to provide the requested services as described above at an economical price by the close of business October 21, 2011.

All responses received will be evaluated. A determination by the government to compete, or not compete, the proposed procurement action is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

It is emphasized that all information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement and will not be construed as a formal proposal.

The government will not reimburse any costs connected with providing the requested capability information.

These technologies will be used to track the location and flow of assets and people, as well as monitoring factors, such as temperature.  These capabilities can result in the design of more optimal processes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of patient care, reductions in staff hours spent searching for equipment, and the ability to maintain more accurate less expensive inventory levels within VA.  The purpose of the RTLS solution is to improve the efficiency of targeted business processes in its hospitals, clinics, offices and cemeteries to support the missions of Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefit Administration (VBA) and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) and other VA entities.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) is an independent Federal entity that is responsible for U.S.-funded non-military international broadcasting. BBG oversees, through an umbrella organization called the International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB), the Voice of America (VOA), and Radio and TV Marti (referred to collectively as the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB)). VOA is headquartered in Washington, DC. OCB is located in Miami, FL.
<p>The upcoming BBG International Audience Research Program (IARP) Request for Proposal (RFP) will seek potential contractors to provide analytics of BBG's international audience in order to support BBG's mission. It is estimated that the annual total amount of Task Orders to be issued under the planned contract will fall within the $5M - $10M price range.</p>
<p>BBG intends to award a Performance-Based IDIQ contract under which it will issue Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Task Orders.</p>

<p>1.1 Introduction</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a quote is being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-53.</p>
<p>Solicitation number XX001-XX970 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). As a result of this solicitation, GSA anticipates award of a firm-fixed price contract for the services detailed below. This acquisition is a total set-aside for small business in accordance with FAR 19.505-2(a). The applicable NAICS code is 541620 Environmental Consulting Services and the applicable size standard is $7 million.</p>
<p>Please note, in order to be considered for award, all Offerors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. Offerors shall be registered prior to award of the contract.</p>
<p>1.2 Background and Scope</p>
<p>Executive Order (EO) 13514, signed by President Barack Obama on October 5, 2009, represents a new level of Federal effort in operating sustainably. It builds on previous Executive Orders (e.g., EO 13423) and legislation (e.g., Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and the Energy Policy Act of 2005), as well as an increased public understanding of sustainability issues, to require a new level of commitment within the Federal sector to issues of the sustainability of Federal programs and operations.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) has responded by setting the following priorities in its FY 2010-2015 Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan (SSPP):</p>
<p>&bull; GSA will Green its Supply Chain <br />&bull; GSA will Eliminate Waste in its Operations and Activities <br />&bull; GSA will Use its Influence to Reduce the Environmental Impact of the Federal Government</p>
<p>GSA has also committed to conducting a sustainability report in accordance with the standards established by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).</p>
<p>The GRI is a network-based organization that produces a comprehensive sustainability reporting framework that is widely used around the world. The GRI Reporting Framework sets out the principles and Performance Indicators that organizations can use to measure and report their economic, environmental, and social performance. GRI's Reporting Framework is developed through a consensus-seeking, multi-stakeholder process. Participants are drawn from global business, civil society, labor, academic and professional institutions. Sustainability reports based on the GRI Framework can be used to demonstrate organizational commitment to sustainable development, to compare organizational performance over time, and to measure organizational performance with respect to laws, norms, standards and voluntary initiatives. GRI promotes a standardized approach to reporting to stimulate demand for sustainability information - benefitting both reporting organizations and report users.</p>
<p>The objective of this contract is to equip the government with the skills it requires to complete a GRI report. The work performed under this contract shall result in a core group of GSA personnel developing expertise in the application of GRI standards to GSA's operational environment, application of the GRI Framework and principles to GSA's SSPP, and how the agency should approach its first-ever GRI sustainability report.</p>
<p>GSA intends to issue a fixed-price contract for a period of performance of sixty (60) days from the date of award.</p>
<p>2.0 Statement of Work</p>
<p>GSA intends for this acquisition to result in the training of a core group of GSA personnel with the data necessary for them to complete a GSA GRI report. The training will explain all aspects of the GRI reporting process and map GSA's Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan (SSPP) to GRI Principles, Management Approach and Indicators. To accommodate the geographic location of participating GSA staff, the training will be provided online and allow for specific participant engagement.</p>
<p>2.1 Training</p>
<p>The training shall be a minimum of 16 hours and,</p>
<p>1. Identify the main characteristics of the GRI framework for reporting.<br />2. List the steps to preparing a GRI report.<br />3.

Identify the Global Compact Principles and explain how they can be used in the initial evaluation of aspects to report on.<br />5. Give examples of GRI reports where the Global Compact Principles were considered in the reporting process.<br />6. Explain the difference between a GRI category, GRI aspect and a GRI indicator<br />7. Explain what is the GRI materiality principle and its role to select the indicators for action and to report on.<br />8. Explain and give examples of the GRI G3 reporting principles for defining content and to ensure quality of information in a report.<br />9. Explain, using examples, how an organization should report on material indicators, which are not ready to be reported on, and how to establish appropriate performance goals/targets for material indicators.<br />10. Identify what activities GSA needs to undertake to record data and guarantee the continuity of the monitoring process.<br />11. Identify the obligatory components of a GRI G3 report.<br />12. Explain the difference between self-declared GRI report levels and assurance on report information.<br />13. Identify the different formats that the final report can be communicated in.</p>

The Privacy Act of 1974 mandates that the Contractor maintain complete confidentiality of all administrative, medical and personnel records, and all other pertinent information that comes to his/her attention or knowledge. The Privacy Act carries both civil and criminal penalties for unlawful disclosure of records. Violation of such confidentiality shall be cause for adverse action.

If the contractor's equipment replaces equipment already in use, the exchange of equipment shall be accomplished without interruption of gas supply to the using facility. Contractor installed equipment shall remain the property of the contractor and shall be removed upon termination of the contract, when directed by the ordering facility and in full cooperation with the succeeding contractor so as to avoid interruption of gas supply.

6.2 To permit orderly transition from one contractor to another, the contractor shall continue to honor the contract's monthly equipment rental fee and bulk oxygen contract price for a maximum of 30 days beyond the scheduled expiration of the contract period, unless transition from one contractor to another is completed prior to the 30 day transition period. For any partial month, the contractor shall prorate the monthly equipment rental fee accordingly. The contractor shall continue to provide and maintain its equipment during this transition period.

6.3 No guarantee is given or implied that data included in the schedule regarding contractor owned equipment currently located at the facilities is complete and accurate as to the factors affecting the cost of furnishing and installing the required contractor-owned tanks and appurtenances. Offerors are strongly encouraged to visit the facility sites prior to submitting a bid and take other steps as may be reasonably necessary to ascertain the nature and location of the work, and the general and local conditions which can affect the work or the cost thereof. Failure to do so shall not relieve offerors from the responsibility of estimating properly the difficulty and cost of successfully performing the work. Site visits may be arranged by contacting the COTR designated in the solicitation schedule.

7. DELIVERY OF MEDICAL LIQUID BULK OXYGEN

7.1 Deliveries of oxygen are scheduled by the contractor based on information transmitted by the oxygen level monitoring system. The contractor will have a delivery-forecasting program that assesses the OVAMC recent and historic usage and determines when replenishment of the liquid oxygen supply is needed. The reorder, alarm, safety, and reserve levels will be coordinated with the COTR. Alarm levels will be set at such points to avoid frequent alarms. The delivery system shall be designed so that scheduling of the replenishment of the oxygen supply requires no intervention on the part of medical center personnel. Offeror shall have the capability and resources to respond to routine requests within 48-hrs and emergency requests within 6-hrs. 

7.2 The contractor shall deliver medical-grade liquid oxygen within 48 hours after the reorder point on the main tank is reached. If the 48 hours ends on a weekend, delivery will be on Monday. If for any reason the contractor is unable to deliver at the agreed upon day or time, the contractor will provide 24-hour notice to the COTR, so that the facility can initiate an alternate backup action. In accordance with VHA Patient Safety Alert dated April 5, 2004, all deliveries must be monitored by a qualified and trained technical representative (COTR) from OVAMC. Contractor will be provided with names and contact information of primary and back-up facility representatives. This applies to all deliveries regardless of time or day of execution.

7.3 The contractor shall provide 24-hour notice prior to delivery or upon mutual agreement between the facility and contractor, alternate ordering/delivery methods such as pre-scheduled deliveries, calling for tank level readings, installing a telemetry unit, etc. may be arranged. If for any reason the contractor is unable to delivery at the agreed upon day or time, the contractor will provide 24-hour notice to the COTR, so that the facility can initiate an alternate backup action. In accordance with VHA Patient Safety Alert dated April 5, 2004, all deliveries must be monitored by a qualified and trained technical representative that will be designated by each facility. Contractor will be provided with names and contact information of primary and back-up facility representatives. This applies to all deliveries regardless of time or day of execution. 

7.4 Tanks(s) will be filled to maximum functional capacity at each refilling procedure unless otherwise specified in the facility requirements or as agreed upon in a written document signed and dated by the COTR. If the tank cannot be filled to maximum capacity at the time of delivery, the driver must annotate the reason for the partial delivery and indicate when a subsequent delivery will be made to completely fill the tank to capacity, at no additional cost.

7.5 At the time of each delivery, contractor must provide a legible signed and dated written document that identifies the tank level prior to fill, the level after fill, and the quantity delivered. This document must be counter-signed by the facility representative supervising the delivery. 

7.6 Emergency delivery will be provided within 24-hours after receipt of Government notification. Contractor must respond to the facility by either telephone or email within one hour to confirm receipt of emergency notification to ascertain the nature of the emergency. Emergency status is determined by the Government when conditions warrant, such as an actuated main bulk tank low level alarm, imminent alarm condition, or system leak. Failure of the contractor to remain current with agreed delivery schedule and requirements does not constitute an "emergency" for purposes of charging an emergency delivery fee. 

7.7 Delivery Information: 

Location: Orlando VA Medical Center, 5201 Raymond St., Orlando, FL32803
Instructions: Monday through Friday, 7:30 am - 3:30pm (except in emergency cases). All deliveries shall be monitored by COTR or designee).

9. APPLICABLE REGULATIONS & STANDARDS

The following is a list of some of the regulations and standards that are applicable to this contract. The list is not comprehensive, and the contractor is responsible for ensuring that all products, equipment and services provided under the contract are in compliance with applicable Federal, state, and local regulations. If applicable, the editions in effect as of the date of this solicitation are listed. Contractor is responsible for remaining compliant with any future revisions that are effective at the time of contract performance.

Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 210 & 211 - CGMP regulations for supplying medical grade oxygen.

29 CFR 1910.104 Applies to the installation of bulk oxygen systems on industrial and institutional consumer premises 

49 CFR - Transportation

Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

NFPA 50: Standard for Bulk Oxygen Systems at Consumer Sites, 2001 Edition

NFPA 99: Standard for Health Care Facilities, 2002 Edition

U.S.P. 23 

Density data and volume measurement equivalents published in Compressed Gas Association Pamphlet No. P-6, titled "Standard Density Data, Atmospheric Gases and Hydrogen," shall be used when necessary to convert measurement of gases from one form to another. For example, the following conversion factor shall apply for conversion from gallons to cubic feet. 

Calculation based on data in CGA P-6

1 ft liquid O2 = 860.6 ft gas (Table 1)
1 ft liquid O2 = 7.48052 gal ((Table 2)

Therefore:

7.48052 gal (1 ft) liquid O2 = 860.6 ft gas

1 gal liquid O2 = 860.6 ft gas
                             7.48052

1 gal liquid O2 = 115.05 ft gas 
or more commonly quoted as 1 gal liquid O2 = 115.1 ft gas

<p>11. POSITION DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Republic of Burundi recently emerged from more than a decade of brutal civil war and held democratic elections in 2005. It faces a host of complex food issues requiring Title II food assistance. Low agricultural productivity, limited non-farm opportunities, and lack of access to basic social services continue to hinder advancements in food security. In FY 2011, Burundi received has received $25 million in Title II food aid assistance, of which $8 million was for emergency food aid, and $17 million was for non-emergency programs.</p>
<p>To help determine the need for and improve, monitor, and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the assistance provided under the Title II food aid program in Burundi, the <br />United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is seeking applications from U.S. citizens or Third Country Nationals interested in the position of Food for Peace Officer in Burundi.</p>
<p>With technical support from the Regional FFP Office based at the USAID/East Africa regional mission in Nairobi, the FFP Officer will ensure effective management of FFP resources in Burundi. The FFP Officer will ensure effective management of FFP resources in Burundi. His/her primary responsibilities will be to: (1) monitor, report and advise on the implementation and performance of ongoing Title II programs, including the technically-complex PM2A activities; and (2) assess and report on all food security issues, to include changes in the food security situation and food aid requirements, government policies and actions affecting food aid programs.</p>
<p>B. SPECIFIC DUTIES</p>
<p>The FFP Officer will undertake the following duties:</p>
<p>1. Serve as point of contact for all issues pertaining to Title II food aid in Burundi for the USAID Country Representative in Burundi, USAID/Washington, the regional FFP Office in Nairobi, other parts of the U.S. government, PVOs, international organizations, host nation governmental ministries and agencies, and others in the country.</p>
<p>2. Monitor and report on implementation of ongoing Title II programs, including performance of grantees, progress towards meeting objectives, problems encountered and commodity management, including following up on the status of commodity losses and claims.</p>
<p>3. Provide information and guidance to Title II assistance award recipients on Title II regulations, policies and procedures.</p>
<p>4. Report on all food security issues, to include changes in the food security situation and food aid requirements, government policies and actions affecting food aid programs, <br />government food aid programs, and donor pledges and programs.</p>
<p>5. Coordinate with the U.S. Government Country Team, host government, PVOs, international organizations, donors, and others to address issues impacting Title II food aid.</p>
<p>6. Undertake and report on assessments to inform Title II food aid funding decisions or modifications to ongoing programs.</p>
<p>7. Work with PVOs on preparation of annual work plans and program modifications, and with WFP and regional FFP staff on new appeals or revisions to existing ones.</p>
<p>8. Work with other parts of the U.S. government and other donors to promote integration of food aid with other programs to increase the effectiveness of the programs overall.</p>
<p>9. When delegated authority to do so by the FFP Director, serve as COTR for Title II programs.</p>
<p>10. Supervise assigned FSN staff.</p>
<p>11. Undertake other tasks, as assigned.</p>
<p>The basic duties and responsibilities do not change between the GS 13 and GS 14 levels. An employee meeting the qualifications for GS 14 and hired at that level, however, is expected to exercise a higher level of autonomy and require less technical support from FFP/Washington and the Regional FFP Office in Nairobi. Individuals hired at the GS-13 level who during the course of the contract meet the GS-14 minimum requirements, can be considered for promotion based on performance.</p>
<p>C. SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP</p>
<p>The FFP Officer will be supervised on a day-to-day basis by the USAID Country Representative in Burundi, but is expected to be in regular contact with the regional FFP Office in Nairobi, as well as FFP/Washington, to report any information pertaining to ongoing Title II programs. The regional FFP office is available to provide the guidance on technical food aid issues and support through regular visits. The FFP Officer in Burundi will be evaluated annually by the USAID Country Representative in Burundi, with technical inputs from the regional FFP office. The incumbent may supervise one or more FSN staff.</p>
<p>D. SUPERVISORY CONTROLS</p>
<p>The incumbent is expected to take initiative and act independently with little direction, but will have no authority to make financial commitments on behalf of the U.S. Government unless such authority is specifically delegated.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:</p>
<p>1. Technical Capability of the service offered to meet the Government requirement(Acceptable/Not Acceptable);</p>
<p>a. RESUME and transcripts for personnel outlined in the Statement of Work</p>
<p>2. Past Performance;</p>
<p>3. Price<br />(b) Basis of Award: This is a competitive solicitation for quotations utilizing Best Value procedures in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.5. The best value approach for evaluation will entail a resultant award determination based upon: the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation, assigned an acceptable past performance rating. In order to be considered for award by the Government, vendors must adhere to the quotation requirements and respective evaluation factors of; 1.) Technical Capability 2.) Past Performance and 3.) Price as detailed in addendum herein to Clause 52.212-1.</p>
<p>(c) As outlined in para (a) above, the evaluation factors of Price, Technical Acceptability, and Past Performance will be utilized by the Government in making an award determination. Therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms, from a price, technical-specification, and past performance standpoint (as indicated in FAR provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, Addenda).</p>
<p>(End Provision)<br />52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>Award Basis: The Governments evaluation of quotations will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under 52.212-1 of 1.) Technical Capability , 2.) Past Performance, and 3.) Price. The evaluation of these factors will utilize an award basis that results in an award to the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation, that has been assigned an acceptable past performance rating. Quotes that do not meet the stated minimum technical specifications, will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award. In addition, vendor's that are assigned an unacceptable past performance rating will not be considered for award. Finally, quotations that are incomplete and/or are determined to be priced unreasonably too high or too low, may not be selected for award. Therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms, from a price, technical-specification, and past performance standpoint. Under the LPTA source selection process, trade-offs are not permitted, proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-price factors.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITY: The government will evaluate technical proposals in accordance with the SOW on a pass/fail-basis, assigning ratings of acceptable, or unacceptable. An unacceptable rating for any of the below sub-factors will result in an unacceptable rating for this Technical Capability primary factor.

<p><br />Technical Capability Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>EXPERIENCE AND PAST PERFORMANCE: Submit two (2) references of similar type and size of work performed during the last 2 years that the Government can contact to assess your experience and past performance. Failure by vendors to submit past performance information, or the inability to accurately reference points of contacts may result in vendors not being selected for award.<br />Company/Organization Contract Dates Contact Person Telephone No.<br />1. <br />2.</p>
<p>The evaluation of past performance information will result in an overall assessment of satisfactory or unsatisfactory as follows:</p>
<p>Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Satisfactory Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort<br />Unsatisfactory Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p><br />PRICE: Provide a fixed price in accordance with the above schedule and each contract line item to include an all-inclusive, total price quote for completing the required work described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>EXPERIENCE AND PAST PERFORMANCE, WHEN COMBINED, ARE APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO PRICE.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. <br />The following clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation and are included by reference:</p>

The alarm shall have an internal timer so that the audible alarm is reactivated afer a specified time (adjustable between 5 minutes and 15 minutes) The silence device shall not turn off the warning light. <br /><br />13) Provide a means for setting the alarm set point to the exhaust level desired. This adjustable shall be "internal" so that it is not readily adjustable by operating personnel.<br /><br />14) All parts of the system which are apt to be in contact with vapors or gases in the hood shall be chemically resistant, i.e., the controller, sensing device, wiring, etc. <br /><br />Also, Please let me know how your model is protected from the operators permanently silencing the alarm or changing set points easily.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>This project will design four prototype instruments using 2D Raman spectroscopy.  Two instruments will be designed for the trace detection of residual explosives at standoff distances up to 40 meters and identification in less than ten (10) seconds. Two additional instruments will be developed for the non-standoff detection of explosive material to yield highly unique spectral information which can potentially provide a "fingerprint" or compositional analysis of the material within five (5) minutes.

<DESC>SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION

The solicitation is for the Gravesite Expansion Project at the Port Hudson National Cemetery  and is being Sole Sourced in accordance with PL 109-461.
The current projection performed by Memorial Service Network 2 shows depletion of current casket crypt gravesites as early as April, 2012.  Design is shown to be completed by October 2011 for the new site located 1  miles from the existing facility.  The new site is at Mt. Pleasant and Salvant roads, off Highway 61 in Zachary, Louisiana.  Phase 1 of this project requires an early delivery of 2,500 pre-placed concrete crypts.  
Construction solicitation normally takes up to 4 months or more.  Since the design will be completed in October, there is not enough time for the construction solicitation and award.  This will reduce the risk of gravesite depletion at this facility by shortening the normal project delivery time.  
Sole Sourcing to an SDVOSB is in the best interest of the Government.
