<DESC><p class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst">The objective of the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Teacher Education and School Strengthening Activity (STESSA) is to achieve the following goals:</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><strong>Component 1: </strong>To develop, implement, and sustain high-quality STEM teacher education and preparation programs at undergraduate and graduate levels: a. Pre-service teachers will receive quality preparation for modern STEM classrooms, thereby providing the STEM education system with a continuous supply of well-prepared STEM teachers, and raising the quality of teaching and learning in the STEM subjects at the secondary level in STEM schools; b. In-service teachers will be able to enter post-graduate year-long certification programs in STEM Education as well as continue shorter teacher training.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"><strong>Component 2:</strong> To fully institutionalize roles and processes to ensure the sustained quality of STEM schools and support the MOE to scale up STEM education nationwide.: existing STEM high schools will be strengthened and fully institutionalized, and the Ministry of Education (MOE) will have the capacity to sustain the quality of existing STEM high schools and expand the model to additional governorates/nationwide. Through in service teacher training and professional development, those new schools will enjoy the same quality of teaching and learning, and the same level of administrative and technical support for teacher and administrator development and procurement.<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="color: red;"></span></em></p>
