IP cores are every specific in their programming, interfaces, requirements, performance, resources, and configuration. Therefore, it is not usually practical or efficient to attempt to swap an IP core that was used previously in a design with a different core, as it would require significant re-design or changes to the surrounding interfaces and /or programming to accommodate the swap. <p> The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 <p> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 01/22/2016.

<DESC>This notice supersedes and replaces the Pre-Solicitation notices issued on the Federal Business Opportunities website dated December 8, 2015; and subsequently cancelled on December 18, 2016, then re-issued on January 5, 2016.
The Robley Rex VA Medical Center in Louisville, Kentucky has a requirement for construction services for Project number 603-15-102, Replace Faade Phase II.  The intent of this project is to make repairs to the exterior faade of buildings # 1,3,4,5 and 6.  Building 1, an eleven story tall structure, partially restored in 2012 has multiple points of failure in the faade including cracked cast stone and brickwork, failed mortar joints, corroded lintels, and failed joint sealant.  The remaining buildings (3,4,5 and 6) have similar exterior conditions.  These buildings were built in the early 1950's with brick veneer that lacked weep ports and did not account for differential expansion which has attributed to failures.

<p>The program office is not capable of providing specific dates for training upfront as the mission can delay trainings. Therefore, flexibility with training is necessary as well as quick turnarounds. Trainings coincide with fielding events there are a total of six events over three years. However, the AOC continues to receive baseline updates/upgrades/alterations of the components listed in the Manufacture Roster (for example Red Hat v5.8 upgraded to Red Hat 6.2). In the event the upgrade requires training, the contractor will need to be able to support <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">surge capability </em>to address training to the entire enterprise within the same Fiscal Year.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal Plant Health Inspection Services, Center for Plant Health Science and Technology (USDA/APHIS/CPHST) (Office of Edinburg, TX , is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified commercial and nonprofit businesses capable of providing DNA sequencing, gene synthesis, molecular biology and genomic services. This will be a Blanket Purchase Agreement for a five year period. <br /><br />The APHIS-CPHST Lab in Edinburg, Texas is involved in multiple molecular diagnostic programs that require DNA sequencing of samples. These samples are used to generate new molecular tools and to provide identifications to intercepted invertebrates. In both cases these DNA sequences will be used to make quarantine and regulatory decisions that have associated economic costs. Therefore, we require a Sanger DNA sequencing service that can provide DNA sequences with &ge;99% accuracy for at least 800 DNA nucleotides with process requests of up to 300 samples at a time. Because much of the projects are time sensitive, the turn around time should be less than two business days and the failure rate due to combined human error and instrument error must be below 0.5%. The contractor must be able to receive samples sent via overnight shipment and be able to analyze samples sent at room temperature during transport.
<p><br />DNA sequencing is the process of deciphering the nucleotide (i.e., A, C, T, G) arrangement within nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, etc.). This information can be used to identify pest/non-pest species either directly by comparing the DNA sequences (i.e., DNA barcoding) or indirectly by using the sequences to develop alternate DNA-based techniques of analysis. Deciphering the DNA sequence of various species and populations is crucial for the development of all molecular diagnostic tools.</p>
<p>There are various methods in use today where DNA sequencing is performed. Sanger sequencing involves chemical reactions that incorporate four different fluorescent dyes to DNA molecules such that each type of nucleotide is specifically labeled. The labeled DNA molecules are separated using an instrument called a DNA Sequencer. The DNA Sequencer includes optical sensors and computer software that can decipher the different dye labels and reconstruct the DNA sequence. These instruments are relatively expensive and are designed to perform optimally using specific chemical dyes, software, and reagents.</p>
<p>Various companies/institutions provide DNA sequencing services but often use different manufacturers/models of instruments and different chemical recipes for the initial sequencing reactions. As a result, the quality of the deciphered DNA sequences can vary based on sequence length and nucleotide confidence. In addition, the laboratory set-up, available computer system for sample submittal/retrieval, and general staffing levels can influence the turn-around time of the deliverable product (i.e., DNA sequences).</p>

<DESC>SUBJECT: Sources Sought Notice, Soldier Protective System (SPS) - Vital Torso Protection (VTP) Program - Full Rate Production (FRP) Phase - Small Business Set Aside (SBSA)<br /><br />1. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized via the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.<br /><br />2. The Government is issuing this Sources Sought to collect information for the Full Rate Production (FRP) Phase of the Vital Torso Protection (VTP) Program under the Soldier Protection System (SPS). The SPS VTP consists of lightweight hard armor plates that provide the Soldier multiple levels of ballistic protection that can be tailored to select mission profiles and protection against specific threats from conventional fragmenting munitions, small arms ammunition, and blunt impact. This RFI is exclusively for the two side plate variants including the Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts (ESBI) and the X-Side Ballistic Inserts (XSBI). Soldiers equipped with the SPS VTP will be able to accomplish a broad range of missions. The versatility of the system will enable the Soldier to quickly transition from one mission type to another without degrading the momentum of small unit operations. The SPS will support major combat operations, stability operations, homeland security operations, joint operating concepts, and the joint force functional concept.<br /><br />3. Blunt trauma injury associated with Back Face Deformation (BFD) measurements and test standards will be in accordance with the current approved Government Department of Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) test protocols. The technical requirements for each variant are provided in the DRAFT Purchase Description (PD), including the threshold weight and ballistic performance requirements; copies of the PD can be requested from the POC listed at the end of this notice. It is the Army's intent to include a separate requirement, or optional contract line item, for an industrial base maintenance contract (IBMC) that will provide a maintenance capability for the hard body armor plates. The acquisition organization responsible for this effort is the Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG).<br /><br />4. The proposed project is expected to result in multiple Firm Fixed Price contracts. The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsive contractors; therefore, the type of solicitation issued may depend, in part, upon the responses received to this notice. Based on responses received to a previous notice of 28 July 2015, the Government has determined that there are a sufficient number of qualified small businesses to perform specific requirements on this program and may incorporate a Small Business Set Aside (SBSA) for the Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts (ESBI) and X-Side Ballistic Inserts (XSBI) variants. As previously advertised, the Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts (ESAPI) and X-Small Arms Protective Inserts (XSAPI) variants are open to all prospective offerors including both large and small businesses.<br /><br />5. The SPS VTP FRP acquisition strategy continues to be developed. Respondents are encouraged to identify and describe any unique solutions that will result in effective and efficient operations and allow PM SPE to refine their requirements, as necessary. Any resulting contract awards will be based on the overall "Best Value" solution to the Government. Evaluation criteria is planned to include the factors of technical (weight and ballistic performance), delivery, past performance, quality management system, small business plan, and price. <br /><br />6. The Offeror responses to this notice shall be limited to 20 pages and should include the following information:<br /><br />&bull; Offeror's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address.<br /><br />&bull; Offeror's interest in bidding on the solicitation when it is issued.<br /><br />&bull; Offeror's capability to meet design requirements.<br /><br />&bull; Offeror's capability to perform a contract of this magnitude and complexity (include offeror's in-house capability to execute comparable design work performed within the past 5 years and a brief description of the project, customer name, timeliness of performance, customer satisfaction, and dollar value of the project) - provide at least 3 examples.<br /><br />&bull; Offeror's detailed description of their proposed design solutions capability to meet ballistic performance requirements.<br /><br />&bull; Offeror's shall develop a flow chart showing the supply chain, the work efforts at each location and production equipment to support the VTP manufacturing and control.<br /><br />&bull; Offeror's shall identified methods for subcontractor management: subcontractor selection and rating criteria and surveillance strategy for the proposed design solutions to meet all performance requirements.<br /><br />&bull; Offeror's shall identify VTP production minimum and maximum capability.<br /><br />&bull; Offeror's small business type and Business Size (HUB Zone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a), woman owned, etc.).<br /><br />7. Following the deadline to respond to this notice, the Government plans to release a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) to industry to solicit potential candidates and receive comments and questions to incorporate into the Final RFP to be issued for the FRP Phase and competition. <br /><br />8. Request interested vendors provide, not later than 8 February 2016 of the posting of this Notice, a detailed description of their proposed VTP plate designs that meet the PD requirements and the vendor's level of interest to participate in a possible competitive acquisition. Each vendor's response shall address specific size, weight, shape, performance and durability requirements as stated in the PD (ESBI and XSBI). This information should be provided via email to George Hubbard at <a href="mailto:George.b.hubbard5.civ@mail.mil">George.b.hubbard5.civ@mail.mil</a>. Submittals received prior to 8 February 2016 are greatly appreciated.<br /><br />9.

<p>This procurement is anticipated to be a 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with an estimated order quantity of one to three units for each part over the life of the contract, procured via Firm Fixed Price (FFP), range quantity pricing may be requested. Item Unique Identification (IUID) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) will apply to parts that are tracked through serial numbers and/or over $5000. The U.S. Government (USG) has the Guardrail Modernization system specification, but limited drawings for the parts. The manufacturers of the parts possess the related detailed drawings. Prospective sources must be able to prove that the parts to be delivered will enable the Guardrail Modernization system to satisfy the requirement in the Government's specification. No Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE) or Government-Furnished Property (GFP) will be provided to sources to execute the contract. Sources must be able to fulfill orders upon contract award, with production lead time allowed for long lead materials and production ramp-up. Reverse engineering is not applicable to this effort. All interested potential sources must prepare a response (in Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat, rich text or text format) no greater than 10 pages in length, specifying their ability to supply the parts as required by the USG. Include knowledge of the Guardrail weapon system and past history in support of this subsystem at a minimum. The response or related questions must be sent via email to kenneth.acquaviva@dla.mil by January 21, 2016.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH, CLINICAL CENTER, OFFICE OF PURCHASING AND CONTRACTS, TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) under NAICS code, [423430], that have the capability, experience, and capacity to provide special software that works with CRIS for notes and patient list in support of the Department of Clinical Research Informatics, NIH as described in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>Background<br />The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (NIH CC) in Bethesda MD is the Federal Government's biomedical research hospital, supporting clinical investigation conducted at many of the intramural programs of the NIH. It provides patient care services for a wide range of people (children, adults, healthy volunteers, etc.) who are participating in research in a variety of settings (inpatient units, ambulatory clinics and day hospitals). The programs of research it supports cover medical conditions, some quite complex, encountered in a wide variety of disciplines, including medical sub-specialties, surgery, pediatrics, neurology, behavioral health, genetics and gynecology, among others.<br />The Department of Clinical Research Informatics (DCRI) develops and maintains the information technology (IT) infrastructure for the CC, including clinical, ancillary care, and business and administrative systems. Most importantly, DCRI has the responsibility for the electronic health record (EHR), called Clinical Research Information System (CRIS), which is used by the healthcare staff and clinical investigator teams to track their patients; to document the patient's problems and medical findings the assessment and plan for care and clinical progress over time; to order medications, diagnostic tests, etc.; to manage patient care-related tasks; to document bedside observations; and to retrieve and display test results. Over time CRIS has become a near complete complete, centralized source of patient information, accessible to all, including the patients themselves. <br />CRIS is built on commercial software (Allscripts<sup>TM</sup> Sunrise Clinical Manager<sup>TM</sup>, SCM), which contains a full set of standard EHR components. In general, the usability of the software is reasonably good. However, at the CC special circumstances and requirements related to activities both of patient care as well as clinical research operations sometimes pose unique, complex informatics challenges that prove difficult to address with the standard EHR configuration tools. Fortunately, the Allscripts<sup>TM</sup> product SCM has a robust software development environment, including its own proprietary computer coding language and an "open" platform. This allows the system to be customized, including the creation of novel functions, as well as the way the standard components are accessed and used. Although CRIS development is an ongoing work-in-progress, the unique capability to customize SCM has proven very beneficial for the CC enterprise and CRIS, enabling DCRI developers to custom-configure it to improve problems of EHR usability and to deliver the desired complex functionality.<br />Purpose<br />The purpose of this work is to enable functionality in CRIS that improves the quality of patient clinical progress notes and other communication, for example reducing, if not eliminating, the documentation errors, including the practice of "copy forward"; facilitates the management of a centralized, encoded, patient problems list that works in an intuitive manner; and gives clinicians the ability to produce problem-oriented medical progress notes and other patient care documents (in a standard Problem-Oriented Medical Record format) that are appropriate and relevant for their discipline and also satisfies institutional record-keeping requirements.<br />Scope of Work<br />The general scope of the work involves installing, customizing, and testing a commercial software product that has two functional components that directly support user functions in CRIS. Following an initial software and business environment analysis, it will follow the typical, standard software deployment method used by DCRI, progressing through a series of environments: Development (DEV), Test (TEST), a copy of the EHR production environment (PRODCOPY) and, finally, Production (PROD). At each step, scripts for functional and systems testing will be developed and run. Following deployment in TEST, training will be conducted for IT, clinical and help desk (support) staff. Specific steps include: <br />Phase 0 (Pre): Environmental Assessment <br />- Analyze the configuration of the NIH CC EHR to identify versions of various software components and define data items and elements that will need custom mapping <br />Phase I: (in Development environment) <br />- Install DLL<br />- Create custom DB objects<br />- Configure SCM<br />- Install MLM's<br />- Configure product<br />- Create templates<br />- Generate institution-specific, relevant functional and system test scripts based on use cases with real patient examples<br />Phase 2: QA (Test environment)<br />- Install DLL<br />- Create custom DB objects<br />- Configure SCM<br />- Install MLM's<br />- Configure Clinical Documentation tool<br />- Create templates<br />- Conduct data validity testing<br />- Conduct performance testing<br />- Conduct testing in Production-equivalent environment<br />- Conduct Template Manager testing<br />Phase 3: Training<br />- Helpdesk staff<br />- IT education staff (&lsquo;training the trainers')<br />Phase 4: Production Deployment<br />- Prepare installation package<br />- Install in Production</p>

<p>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.<br />The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which mission it is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.<br />Discoveries about the molecular basis of disease provide unprecedented opportunities to translate research findings into new medicines. However, developing a brand-new drug takes an enormous amount of time, money and effort, mainly due to bottlenecks in the therapeutic development process. Delays and barriers mean that translation of a promising molecule into an approved drug often takes more than 14 years. It is crucial to advance strategies to reduce this time frame, decrease costs and improve success rates.<br />Drug repurposing is one such strategy. Many agents approved for other uses already have been tested in humans, so detailed information is available on their pharmacology, formulation and potential toxicity. Because repurposing builds upon previous research and development efforts, new candidate therapies could be ready for clinical trials quickly, speeding their review by the Food and Drug Administration and, if approved, their integration into health care.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: <br />NCATS is in need of a feasibility study that investigates the collaboration between NCATS, OpenPHACTS, and Data2Discovery and identify potential collaboration partners for specific rare and neglected diseases.</p>
<p>Scope of Work:<br />The vendor shall provide the following: <br />&bull; The vendor shall investigate and submit a detailed report outlining the key opportunities for a wider collaboration, involving NCATS, OpenPHACTS, Data2Discovery, by particularly identifying one or more major potential partners in rare and neglected diseases<br />&bull; This detailed report shall include a technical demonstration of how these two resources together with state of the art data mining tools can be used to identify drug repurposing opportunities for the identified disease.</p>

Based on a preliminary risk assessment conducted by NAWCTSD, this task is expected to be competed under the unrestricted LOT of FTSS III.  The risk assessment took into account the complexity of managing this dynamic training requirement to include sites extending up and down both East and West Coasts of the contiguous United States and in the Hawaiian Island chain with a range of training devices.
  Location of the training sites, variety and varying complexity of the training devices and flexibility to respond to training demand variations and unforeseen impediments are characteristics of the requirement to which the contractor must be able to demonstrate the capability and resources needed to be successful.  During the acquisition planning stage for FTSS III, it was determined that small businesses were not suitable for contracts that had the stated complexity components.

Businesses potentially willing to submit a proposal are invited to provide a capabilities statement which contains, at a minimum, business size and the Lot(s) that they have been awarded contracts under the Fielded Training Support Systems (FTSS III) Multiple Award Contract (MAC).

NAWCTSD requests any small businesses with a compelling argument as to why their firm should be eligible to propose to this task, submit a capabilities statement inclusive of the following: (1) justification that shows how the inherent risks associated with this requirement can be mitigated to include demonstration of successful Past Performance in a similarly complex environment; (2) contracts with a minimum of two each supported sites on the East, West coast and one in a non-contiguous location (Alaska or Hawaii) simultaneously, (3) dollar values and site locations; and (4) Point of Contact (POC) for each site to include name, address, phone, email.
 Summaries should be no longer than five (5) pages in length.

Information should be sent via e-mail to Harrison.carter@navy.mil, Responses are requested by 12 February 2016.

The submission of this information is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any services, nor for the Government to pay for the information received.  No request for proposal solicitation document exists at this time.  Questions concerning this requirement should be directed to the Contract Specialist, H. David Carter, via email harrison.carter@navy.mil or by telephone at (407)380-4350.

<DESC><p align="left">The US Fleet Forces are often present in congested waterways throughout the world for a variety of humanitarian and military purposes. To maintain situational awareness (SA) and to support target detection, tracking, and identification, electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) sensors could be employed for their superior resolution and image-forming mode of operation, in contrast to radar. Surface ships require self-protection against a diversity of threats, surface and air borne. As such it is important to monitor the entire hemispherical dome (360 degrees azimuth X 90 degree vertical) for potential threats. The operational range and resolution requirements make it impractical to deploy a conventional imaging sensor since that would lead to single frames with hundreds of megapixels of data. In most operational scenarios a large fraction of these pixels (&gt;90%) will not contain meaningful or relevant information and hence such an approach is deemed to be extremely inefficient. It should also be noted that as the vertical angle changes from near the horizon to directly overhead, the nature of the background and expected threat signatures will also change in a dramatic manner. Therefore it would not be appropriate to employ an imaging sensor with operational characteristics that remain invariant over the range of vertical angles.</p>
<p>Researcher initiatives in Computational Imaging and Application Specific Imaging have suggested alternate measurements that produce far lower volume of data without losing underlying task-relevant information. They accomplish this by tailoring the measurements appropriately by incorporating prior information about the background and target statistics. Employing multi-modal sensing (spectral, polarization and temporal signatures) is another approach to reducing the data volume generated by conventional imaging sensors.</p>
<p>The ONR Code 312 EO-IR Technologies Focus Area seeks information on unconventional approaches to full hemispherical imaging for situational awareness. Designs concepts of interest will yield systems that are simpler, less expensive, and reduce the data load by at least two orders of magnitude, while maintaining performance as indicated by probability of detection for selected target sets, and low false alarm rates for given background conditions. High-performance designs and architectures may be of interest even if required underlying technologies are not available currently.</p>

It is understood that the Federal agency will provide reasonable accommodations during the applicant hiring process.</p>
<p>&bull; Track all candidates submitted to requesting agencies, beginning with resume submittal to actual hiring. Additionally, the contractor shall attend weekly conference calls with the agencies' points of contact.</p>
<p>&bull; Assign an experienced recruitment specialist with a minimum of five years of successful search experience in the field of disabilities to work with agency staff and management on the recruitment efforts.</p>
<p>&bull; Prior to presentation of candidates, the contractor shall conduct a preliminary candidate screening to determine suitability, availability and level of interest. The contractor shall ensure that candidates presented meet the established qualification requirements.</p>
<p>The Government is contemplating a General Services Administration (GSA) buy for this requirement. Interested firms should submit a white paper with no more than five pages describing its capabilities and experience descriptions, estimated prices, and any other relevant information to OPM. Firms should also answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Does your company have a current GSA schedule? If so, state the contract number.</p>

In kitchen/food service areas, demolition of existing walls will be required to allow for construction of larger food service areas. Spaces will be reconfigured with increased square footage, trench floor drainage, and new built-in refrigeration. New service counters and point-of-sale stations will also be constructed. The electrical system will be replaced in its entirety to accommodate new operational needs and accommodate the new physical layouts. Additional upgrades will be made to meet life safety and regulatory requirements. This project will also include installation of Government furnished equipment items.</p>

<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>DuPont is an operating chemical manufacturing complex, located in Salem County, New Jersey. In the 1940s, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company performed work for the federal government in support of the nation's early atomic energy program. The USACE is addressing residual radioactive contamination in specific areas of the property under the FUSRAP. The areas are collectively referred to as the DuPont Chambers Works FUSRAP Site.</p>
<p>USACE identified the FUSRAP-eligible constituents of concern in site soils that were related to the uranium processing activities at the site and that could pose a risk to human health under an industrial land use scenario. Constituents of concern are uranium, thorium, and radium; specifically Uranium-234 (U-234), Uranium-235 (U-235), Uranium-238 (U-238), Thorium-230 (Th-230), and Radium-226 (Ra-226). The remedial action recommended in the Proposed Plan and selected in the Record of Decision, signed on September 12, 2013, only addresses these FUSRAP-eligible constituents of concern and does not address other hazardous contaminants that may be present at the site.</p>
<p>Major components of the selected remedy include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull;	Excavation of contaminated soil with total uranium concentrations above the remediation goal of 65 picocuries/gram (pCi/g); <br />&bull;	physical separation and management of excavated material containing non-FUSRAP hazardous substances that are commingled with FUSRAP-eligible contaminants; <br />&bull;	transportation of excavated soils by rail to an off-site, permitted disposal facility; <br />&bull;	recovery of water and non-aqueous phase liquids; <br />&bull;	performance of a final status survey to verify that the completed remedial action meets the soil remediation goal; <br />&bull;	implementation and evaluation of monitored natural attenuation to address residual uranium contamination in groundwater, after completing the soil response action; and <br />&bull;	implementation of land use controls to limit potential onsite exposure to contaminants during remedial action activities.</p>
<p>CONTRACT REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>When a solicitation is issued, firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for all of the required work.

<DESC>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.<br /><br />The Department of Defense (DoD) Combat Casualty Care Research Program (CCCRP) plans, programs, budgets and oversees the execution of trauma research aimed at optimizing survival and recovery of US service personnel injured in combat (current and future scenarios). In contrast to investigator-initiated medical research, the DoD CCCRP supports requirements-driven investigations aimed at resolving defined gaps in combat casualty care.<br /><br />As the DoD CCCRP endeavors to sustain and advance successes in Neurotrauma Research, it seeks information necessary for advancing the care for traumatic brain injury and other forms of neurologic trauma.
<p>Included in this area of interest are three capabilities for use in moderate to severe TBI: 1) Devices or assays to rapidly diagnose the severity of brain injury at point of injury or point of need that can be used by first responders (medics and corpsmen) 2) Technology to monitor, record and transmit critical physiological parameters in the minutes to hours following injury, and stabilize the casualty during prolonged evacuation times, and 3) Drugs, biologics, or other agents that can be used in the pre-hospital environment to mitigate the progression of secondary brain injury.</p>
<p>It is requested that the devices described be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, the technology system/subsystem model or prototype demonstrated in a relevant environment.<br /><br />See Attachment for full RFI and submission instructions.</p>

<CONTACT>Onyenauch Washington, Senior Contracting Officer, Phone (919) 541-0423, Email uche.washington@nih.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. The National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, NC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Expression Analysis Incorporated, Durham, NC for NextGen sequencing services for Ribonucleic acid (RNA). This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.5, Test Procedures for Certain commercial Items, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996) in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. The FAR as supplemented by the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) will be used to evaluate the offer and award this requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541380, "Testing Laboratories" with a size standard of $15.0M. The anticipated award will include a 12-month base period (September 4, 2016 through September 3, 2017) with one 1-year option period (September 4, 2017 through September 3, 2018).
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to provide continued support of NextGen sequencing services for Ribonucleic acid (RNA) in progress that support Intramural Research Division (IRD) research objective's and to further explore how human health and human disease are caused by the interactions of the environment. This study is only a portion of on-going projects for the continuation of experiments started under a current contract (HHSN273201500012I) with Expression Analysis. Failure to use the same sequencing provider for this portion of the experiment will render previous multiple data sets un-interpretable and un-publishable, requiring the Transcriptional Responses to the Environment Group (TREG) to re-do previous experiments with a new vendor at a huge cost to the NIEHS. The libraries created must be performed using the same instrumentation as previous experiments and is not available to the Epigenomics Core Laboratory (ECL), thus, creating ambiguities in the sequence data which will be generated. Also, the data from this project must be provided to the NIEHS via ftp and the data files must be provided in both the. fastq and .cel format. The Contractor is also required to perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>- NextGen Sequencing;<br />- RNA or DNA extraction;<br />- DNA library construction;<br />- Sequence analysis;<br />- NextGen Sequence Bioinformatics Data Analysis;<br />- Data output file; and<br />- Mapping sequence data file</p>
<p>This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 10 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within 10 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, the order will be issued to Expression Analysis. There is no solicitation package available. The Contracting Officer for this requirement is Ms. Onyenauch&eacute; Washington. All questions or concerns relating to this notice shall be submitted by e-mail to uche.washington@nih.gov.</p>

William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home National Historic Site

Statement of Need

The historic Cassidy House at William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home National Historic Site (Birthplace) was damaged due to fire during the early morning hours of December 25, 2015. The local fire department quickly responded and extinguished the fire. There is fire, water, and smoke damage to the house.

The Cassidy House is located at 117 South Hervey Street, Hope, Arkansas, approximately 110 miles southwest of Little Rock, Arkansas. The Cassidy House was constructed in 1917 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is a two-story wood-framed structure and is an example of the American Foursquare type of building. The two stories are approximately 2,852 square feet. There is an attic. The house does not have a basement, but is raised above a crawl space that is accessible from two exterior hatches. There is asbestos on a water heater tank liner in the kitchen of the house. And although the house was abated of lead based coatings in 1995-1996, it was not comprehensive and lead paint was documented in concentrations greater than 5,000 ppm multiple locations in 2013.

The house is set up as a historic house museum for public tours with exhibited period furnishings consisting of upholstered furniture, wood furniture, tables, chairs, chest of drawers, framed pictures, linens, books, magazines, photos, kitchen wares, rugs, glassware, China, draperies, knick-knacks, kitchen appliances, lamps, clothing, mattress sets, pillows, vinyl records, etc. There are approximately 850 museum items displayed in the house.

As a result of the fire the interior of the house and all the furnishings are covered in a fine layer of soot and have a strong odor of the fire. The acidic nature of the soot causes discoloration, corrosion, and overall damage. There is a potential for mold growth due to water used to extinguish the fire. 

This statement is seeking proposals to clean all of the furnishings (all sides/surfaces/interiors, etc.), textiles, objects (all sides/surfaces/interiors, etc.), and interior of house (walls, ceilings, floors, fixtures, etc.) of the house to pre-fire condition. Proposal must include list of chemicals that will be used to treat for mold, reduce the smell, clean items, and chemicals used to eliminate the smoke odor for prior review and approval. Any observed damage to furnishings must be noted, for example, the high temperatures of fires can melt adhesives or plastics. Films and tapes inside containers can be much more damaged than it appears from a cursory glance of the container itself. Any loose or removed architectural features are to be collected; nothing will be thrown out. 

Work will result in all items on exhibit in the house are cleaned to pre-fire condition with no soot residue present. Interior spaces of house like walls, ceilings, floor, fixtures, appliances, etc. are cleaned with no soot residue present. Smoke odor is eliminated and an EPA's air quality index of 0-50 for particle pollution. Mold is eliminated and will not appear within 6 months of completion of contract.

<SUBJECT>70--Annual (1 year) license(s) for Derek Nexus and Meteor Nexus software packages; 
<SOLNBR>RFQ-RT-16-00015
<CONTACT>Pinney, Heather
<DESC>Intent to Sole Source:

NAICS Code: 511210 Software Publishers - Applications software, computer, packaged.  The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Lhasa Limited (Lhasa Ltd), a firm fixed-price purchase order under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) for the purchase of annual license(s) for Derek Nexus (DX), an extensive expert knowledge-based toxicity software package, and related Meteor Nexus (MX), an expert knowledge-based biotransformation software package, for EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT), Immediate Office (IO) located in the Research Triangle Park (RTP), NC.  The purchased license(s) will allow for the use of Lhasa Ltd.'s proprietary software for 5 users at 1 primary site for the term of 1 year with the option to extend the purchase order for an additional two 1-year periods of performance.

The NCCT has an innovative program which includes the generation of high-throughput screening data for thousands of chemicals and the development and application of quantitative structure-activity relationship ((Q)SAR) models for the prediction of relevant toxicities. The DX software package is a unique knowledge-based expert system that houses a vast collection of +500 structural-alerting rules for more than 50 toxicity outcomes of interest to the Agency. The related MX software package is a metabolism prediction system similarly built upon expert knowledge of biotransformation structural-alerting rules, particularly focused on capturing biotransformations that are known to mediate chemical toxicity. The MX software is distinguished from other commercial metabolism predictors by its extensive coverage of nonCYP (Cytochrome P-450) type metabolic transformations known to pertain to toxicity, which are estimated to account for more than half of the known metabolically activated carcinogens in the ToxCast Phase I dataset, its reliance on expert rules (rather than predictive models), and its extensive documentation and linkage to literature sources.  This type of functionality has been developed over decades and supplemented by funding from Companies and other agencies to bring together as broad and comprehensive a pair of expert systems as possible. Re-creating this type of knowledge base is not feasible given the difficulties of compiling metabolism information and the insights from many experts to generate the mapped pathways and structure-activity relationship (SAR) rules. The DX and MX expert software packages are not open source, but the mechanistic underpinning is transparent and the breadth of comparable coverage is not replicated in any other commercial or public tool.  Both software have been licensed by NCCT in the past, but the results need to be updated based on the additional chemistries that have since been tested in the different ToxCast and Tox21 assay platforms. A major limitation of the ToxCast and Tox21 testing programs, to date, has been the absence of metabolic activation in most of the current assay technologies.  Past work with the DX and MX software systems within NCCT has shown that the combined use of these two programs can significantly enhance abilities to identify chemicals for which metabolic activation is likely to be required to produce toxicity. This knowledge will be used to refine toxicity prediction models and inform Adverse Outcome Pathway approaches.  In addition, the systems are complementary to software used by other Lab/Centers within the EPA.  Thus providing a unique opportunity to collaborate more effectively with other research groups and to exploit this expenditure to the fullest extent possible.  Lhasa Ltd. is the only source capable of providing the proprietary DX software and related MX software packages.  This purchase order is therefore being directed, without competition, to Lhasa Ltd. The circumstances permitting Other than Full and Open Competition at this time is FAR 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements.

The intent of this synopsis is to state the Government's intention to sole source this acquisition and to determine if any other source(s) exist; and, therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required service should 1) fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing and submit same via FedConnect, a government web portal, within 15 days from the date of this announcement; and 2) must submit itemized pricing, in US dollars, that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  

Consequently, any responder(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing merely to submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.  Offerors must submit all technical questions / responses concerning this synopsis electronically through FedConnect at www.fedconnect.net/Fedconnect/.  This notice and any amendments will be available via the Internet at the following URL:  www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/ .  You must register with FedConnect as an interested party to submit questions and to view responses.  Vendors can register with FedConnect at www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, 820 Chandler St., Fort Detrick, Maryland, 21702, intends to award a sole source contract to RMISS for services in support of an ITS Telemetry System. The services shall include system hardware recalibration and documentation. The telemetry base station is located at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(2). The FAR citation is 6.302- 1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
<p>RMISS is the only known company capable of providing the required services because this is a follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized services, and it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling USAMRIID's requirements.</p>
<p>RFQ W81XWH-15-T-0043 will be issued on a sole source basis. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 811229 and the small business size standard is $20.5M. Any sources that believe they are eligible to provide these services must respond in writing or respond to the RFQ. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence which articulates the ability to provide the services outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered an affirmative response. Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government. If no written responses are received by the date listed below, which reflects fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice, a purchase order will be awarded without further remark.</p>
<p>All questions and responses concerning this notice shall be emailed to Ms. Sharon R. Smith at sharon.r.smith.civ@mail.mil. Interested concerns must identify their capability to the provided email address no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Time, 22 January 2016.</p>

<p>(viii) The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The following addenda have been attached to this provision: NONE</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this acquisition. The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of that provision are as follows:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>(Tradeoff)</p>
<p><br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the <br />responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and will be <br />most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. <br />The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical, Past<br />Performance and Price.</p>
<p>The Technical element of the evaluation will first be a determination as to whether <br />the proposed product meets the performance characteristics and specifications <br />in the solicitation. Those offers that meet or exceed the stated <br />performance characteristics and specifications will then be evaluated in terms <br />of technical aspects above the minimum requirements and of those aspects <br />not addressed in the solicitation performance characteristics and specifications <br />that would be most beneficial to the Government. In particular, the Government <br />is willing to trade-off on price for offerors that exceed the following <br />performance characteristics/specifications and/or delivery time:</p>
<p>Specifications: <br />1) Digital display that includes both manipulator axes on one console. Limited table space is available for the stereotaxic systems, thus consolidating both axes onto one display console would be highly advantageous and reduce cabeling.<br />2) Nose/tooth bar assemblies with threaded leadscrew positioning capabilities that could be operated single handedly.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source
<p>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to award seven sole source contracts under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with the following state governments as the only responsible source that can provide Newborn Screening for up to 80 conditions:</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under FAR 6.302-1 only one source. Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-83 are incorporated.</p>
<p>Items being purchased in this acquisition:</p>
<p>The three requirements of a newborn screening program are:<br />1. Newborn screen blood spot testing, to include at a minimum, the disorders in the Recommended Universal Screening Panel (RUSP). The most up-to-date RUSP can be found here:<br />http://www.hrsa.gov/advisorycommittees/mchbadvisory/heritabledisorders/recommendedpanel/ <br />2. Newborn screening case management system including processes for tracking cases and individuals whose role is to notify providers when an abnormal test result is identified, and to ensure and help coordinate appropriate follow-up care.<br />3. Newborn screening specialty physician consultation (metabolic, endocrine, immunology and hematology), available as needed to communicate with providers to assist with newborn medical intervention and management.</p>
<p>Newborn Screening is recognized nationally as an essential preventive public health measure. Newborn screening is the practice of screening all babies for conditions that can affect a child's long-term health or survival. Early detection, diagnosis, and intervention can prevent death or disability and enable children to reach their full potential. In the United States, disorders screened are those in the Recommended Universal Screening Panel (RUSP) initially proposed by the American College of Medical Genetics and amended by the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children, (SACHDNC). Conditions screened can vary by state. In addition to the RUSP, some states screen additional disorders according to state law. The SACHDNC continues to review data on additional disorders that may be appropriate to add to the RUSP. When disorders are added to the RUSP, state programs begin the process to add those disorders to their screening panel.<br />A vital part of a successful screening program is appropriate medical intervention for screen positive babies. For some of the disorders screened, this intervention may require urgent or even emergent medical care for the identified baby.

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [x_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [x_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [x_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_x], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[x_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

<DESC>This announcement is a notice of intent to issue a sole source contract under the requirements of FAR Part 15 and FAR 6.302-1," Other Than Full and Open Competition - one responsible source".
<p>The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) intends to issue a sole source, non-commercial for a contractor/consultant to provide expert services to MCC and the Government of Liberia (GoL) to develop an implementation plan for the Liberia Electric Corporations' (LEC) management option. This implementation plan is follow-on work to an analysis of LEC management options presented to the GoL in the Fall of 2015 by McKinsey &amp; Company and this work is intended to support the GoL in meeting the milestones for long term management of LEC laid out in the MCC Compact.</p>
<p>This contract is being awarded under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 - "Only one responsible source" as the only viable course of action that provides uninterrupted continuation of critical services.<br />This contract will be awarded to McKinsey &amp; Company. The period of performance of the contract will be for a period of four months.<br />Justification <br />Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253 &copy; (1), FAR 6.302-1, only one Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements in this case because McKinsey has completed the management options study, and they are uniquely qualified for this follow-on work in two ways. First, they have completed the foundational work for this assignment by doing the management options study and have all of the contextual information regarding the state of LEC, stakeholders and the challenges in the sector and they have developed relationships with key players. Second, they bring excellent technical expertise and resources for this assignment, as demonstrated during the management options study. Specifically, in the analysis of potential private sector options, they have demonstrated deep experience in analysis of utilities and identifying and structuring private sector participation for management of utilities.</p>
<p><br />Competition: <br />The McKinsey contract with USAID was competed but as McKinsey is uniquely qualified for this work, no additional offers were solicited.</p>

<p>A. INTRODUCTION<br />The Government of Liberia (GoL), requires consultancy services to develop an implementation plan for a selected management option for the Liberia Electric Corporations' (LEC). This implementation plan is follow-on work to an analysis of LEC management options presented to the GoL in the Fall of 2015 by McKinsey &amp; Company and this work is intended to support the GoL in meeting the milestones for long term management of LEC laid out in the MCC Compact.</p>
<p>B. BACKGROUND<br />In 2003, after the end of a 14-year conflict, infrastructure in Liberia was largely destroyed, and the electricity sector in particular required significant investment. The Mount Coffee Hydropower Plant, the main source of electricity generation, and the country's distribution network were looted and the utility lacked capacity to manage the reconstruction. Since that time, emergency power programs have supported the installation of diesel generators which provide 22MW of capacity. However, this generation is both insufficient to meet demand and very expensive. To bring on additional capacity, with the support of international donors including MCC, Mt. Coffee is currently being rehabilitated, which will contribute an additional 88MW to the system in the wet season, and Heavy Fuel Oil plants are under construction to contribute an additional 48MW.</p>
<p>To support capacity at LEC, the GoL, with assistance from international partners, tendered a management contract to provide additional technical and managerial capacity and also to provide specific project management assistance for the reconstruction of Mt. Coffee. This management contract was awarded to Manitoba Hydro International (MHI) in April 2010. The contract period was originally for five years, but was later extended to seven years, in particular to provide additional support for the reconstruction of Mt. Coffee.</p>
<p>The current funding for the management support portion of the MHI contract ends in December 2016, although a decision will need to be made about whether and how to extend the project management support for the reconstruction of Mt. Coffee, which is not expected to be fully complete until the end of 2017.</p>
<p>During the summer and fall of 2015 McKinsey and Company conducted an assessment of LEC management options for GoL review, and identified several potential options for long-term management of LEC. This options study was in preparation for a series of decision points laid out in the MCC Compact regarding the GoL's decision for long term LEC management that are specified in the Compact as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; By February 1, 2016, and prior to any Disbursement of MCC Funding under the Energy Project on or after such date, the Government must have communicated in writing to MCC, a selected management arrangement for LEC, and MCC and the Government will have agreed on such arrangement. <br />&bull; By March 15, 2016, and prior to any Disbursement of MCC Funding under the Energy Project on or after such date the Government must have submitted to MCC a management implementation plan approved and adopted by the Board of Directors of LEC with a schedule of milestones for the implementation of the selected management arrangement, including any required interim arrangement for the management of LEC prior to the implementation of the selected management arrangement, in form and substance satisfactory to MCC. <br />&bull; Prior to each Disbursement of MCC Funding under the Energy Project following the adoption of the management implementation plan, the Government must have submitted evidence, in form and substance satisfactory to MCC, that LEC is implementing such plan and is in compliance with the requirements of the plan.</p>
<p>C. OBJECTIVE<br />The Contractor shall develop an implementation plan for the management option selected by the GoL, for use by the GoL and MCC during the course of the Compact. The consultant shall also develop the terms of reference for follow-on work either by a transaction advisor in the case of a private sector participation option for management of LEC or for technical assistance in the case of a publicly managed option.</p>
<p>D. TASKS<br />The contractor shall perform the following tasks: <br />Task 1: Mobilization Plan and Workplan<br />The consultant will provide a Mobilization Plan to include, at a minimum, the resources required for mobilizing the required team and an associated timeline. A workplan, to include a schedule and description of the tasks to be completed will also be provided.<br />Task 2: Development of Implementation Plan<br />Based on GoL selection of their preferred approach, the consultant should develop an implementation plan for the selected strategy. The plan deliverable will include a narrative explaining each of the areas below, a workplan laid out according to quarters of the MCC Compact, financial model, and relevant Terms of Reference for follow-on work. This plan will cover not just the implementation of the long-term management option, but will also account for the short-term measures that are required in order to improve performance at LEC and prepare it for the long-term selected option.<br />This plan will include the following analysis depending on the option selected:<br />&bull; Key Structuring Principles:<br />1. Public Management Option: In the case of a public management option, the consultant will lay out a clear implementation plan for GoL capacity reinforcement. This will include (a) identification of the areas of weakness to be supported by a consultant (b) the key positions at LEC that would be supported (c) term of the consultancy and, (d) expected outcomes<br />2. Management Contract: In the case of a proposed management contract, the consultant will identify: (a) relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs); b) incentive package for the private operator; (c) responsibilities of the parties and delegation of power of the private operator; (d) operating framework between the GoL, LEC and any outside operators; (e reporting requirements; and (e) term of the contract. <br />3. Concession Structuring Principles: In the case of a concession, identify: (a) investment obligations; (b) performance improvements and related indicators; and (c) term of the concession/lease.<br />4. Restructuring: In the case of any restructuring of the electricity sector, the consultant will lay out a) a clear statement of responsibilities of each institution in the sector and (b) workplan and timeline for the restructuring <br />&bull; Financial Analysis: The consultant will prepare financial models to structure the arrangement, define proper performance technical and financial indicators, and ensure that the proposal being developed is commercially viable and satisfies the GoL's objective of improving access to energy, near term management of LEC as well as longer-term capacity at LEC. <br />&bull; Market Analysis: The consultant will also conduct market consultations, in partnership with the GoL, where appropriate, to determine market interest and the conditions that would need to be in place to enable the management arrangement in the electricity sector and to understand market requirements.<br />&bull; Procurement Approach: For all options, but particularly in the case of a management contract or concession, the consultant will specify the recommended procurement approach to maximize the chances of success.<br />&bull; Indicator Analysis: The consultant will recommend key performance indicators that can be used to monitor the health and performance of LEC. These recommendations will draw on the findings the original options analysis with other indicators the consultant might identify as relevant, and discuss each indicator's strengths and weakness with respect to monitoring LEC's performance.</p>
<p><br />Task 3: GoL and Stakeholder Workshops for Plan Finalization<br />Upon development of the draft implementation plan, hold workshops with the LEC Board, MLME and subsequently interested donors in the sector to confirm the feasibility of the approach laid out. Input from these workshops will then be incorporated into the draft plan and then finalized.</p>
<p>E. DELIVERABLE SCHEDULE <br />Outlined below is an indicative timetable, assuming a work period of approximately four (4) months beginning in January 2016 for the Development of the Implementation Plan.<br />Deliverable Due Date<br />Task 1: Mobilization Plan and Workplan End of January 2016<br />Task 2: Submission of Draft Implementation Plan and Financial Models End of February 2016<br />Task 3: Workshop on Implementation Plan and Financial Models for Selected Option End of February 2016<br />Task 3: Finalization of Implementation Plan Report and Financial Models including Presentation to GoL and MCC Early to mid-March 2016</p>

Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to contract on a sole source basis with Carl Zeiss Microscopy LLC., One Zeiss Drive - Thornwood, NY 10594 to procure a one year Service/Support Maintenance Agreement for the following Carl Zeiss Microscopy manufactured instruments:<br />QUANTITY EQUIPMENT SYSTEM SERIAL NUMBER<br />1 EA SCANHEAD LSM 710 2504000301<br />1 EA SCANHEAD LSM 710 2502000484<br />1 EA SCANHEAD LSM 710 2504000417
<p>1 EA ILLUMINATION MODULE PAL-M +SIM 2560000137<br />Service Coverage to include but not limited to:<br />Scheduled and Emergency service performed between the hours of 8:00am and 5:00pm, Monday thru Friday, excluding holidays<br />All travel and labor related charges associated w/service repair visit in addition to PM visit<br />One (1) preventative maintenance inspection (where applicable) per Service Agreement year to include all labor and travel associated with PM visit.<br />All covered replacement parts<br />Software updates when available <br />Factory trained Field Service Representatives and engineers<br />Discount on consumable purchases and instruments upgrades<br />See Attached for other information.<br />Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC is the only entity in the US authorized by Carl Zeiss (the manufacturer) to provide comprehensive service and support for the Carl Zeiss instruments. Only Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC has technical service representatives who receive comprehensive and on-going factory training and regular technical updates, as well as having direct access to original manufacturer's parts to help maintain the instruments in optimal condition. Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC can engage directly with the engineers that designed the instruments, to help resolve challenging technical support needs. <br />These instruments by virtue of their complex nature containing multiple individual components require regular maintenance as well as alignment and calibrations which can only be carried out by dedicated knowledgeable engineers trained specifically by the manufacturer Carl Zeiss. In addition, Carl Zeiss alone owns the rights to all component parts required during the maintenance of these instruments. No other vendor has either access or has to ability to provide these specialized parts. These microscopes are mission critical for the scientific experiments undertaken in the individual laboratories where these devices are maintained in NICHD laboratories. These sophisticated microscopes contain component parts that are both electronics components as well as optical components which have been specifically engineered and incorporated and integrated in a single functioning unit. In addition the component integration is achieved through dedicated computer control using highly complex software systems developed by Carl Zeiss. Carl Zeiss, in addition holds all patent rights for the entire system. Furthermore, Carl Zeiss trains only their engineers on the functions and system control of all these integrated devices. Carl Zeiss does not offer this training to anyone outside of their personnel resources. Furthermore, a service/support maintenance support directly through Carl Zeiss has numerous advantages such as: Factory Trained Engineers, Prioritized/Preferred scheduling for service appointments, unlimited collaborative service visits, unlimited repair service visits, unlimited labor and travel expenses, unlimited certified Zeiss parts, unlimited application and technical phone support w/in business hours, instant remote support, free software and firmware updates, proactively schedule preventative maintenance visits, discounts on upgrades, loaner equipment, fixed cost budgeting, forward deployment of parts and locals service engineers at key institutions. The priority scheduling is very important for the proper upkeep and functionality of these complex microscopes/instruments. Thus, timely service is crucial in the functioning of core facilities and stand-alone research microscopes that student and postdoctoral scientists rely on for their day-to-day work. Acquisition of service contract offering from other entities/third parties providers can lead to substantive problems getting timely service engineer dispatched and can lead to down times on devices. NIH is a research organization where critical experiments require many weeks of tissue culture preparations and also in animal breeding programs, thus such delays will impose a very large financial burden on research laboratories which are hurting for research funds in the first place. Waste of experimental reagents, animals and human resources are the biggest problem in addition to reduction in research productivities. <br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of the 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however, all responses received, within fifteen days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>Combined Synopsis / Solicitation
<p>Title: Bioanalytical Testing Services</p>
<p>(i) This is a combined synopsis-solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(ii) The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-CSS-2016-21 and the solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-85-1/01-04-2016.</p>
<p>(iv) A notice regarding any set-aside restrictions, the associated NAICS code 325199- Chemical Manufacturing - All other basic organic chemical Manufacturing<br />Business Sized Standard: $24.0</p>
<p>(v) Bioanalytical Testing Services of chemical molecules PIP4K2 and KDM5B</p>
<p>(vi) Background <br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.<br /><br />The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which mission it is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.</p>
<p>Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase type-2 alpha (PIP4K2) catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns5P) on the fourth hydroxyl of the myo-inositol ring, to form phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2). It may exert its function by regulating the levels of PtdIns5P, which functions in the cytosol by increasing AKT activity and in the nucleus signals through ING2 and ay regulate the pool of cytosolic PtdIns5P in response to the activation of tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, PIP4K2 may also negatively regulate insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by lowering the levels of PtdIns5P and may be involved in thrombopoiesis, and the terminal maturation of megakaryocytes and regulation of their size.</p>
<p>Lysine-specific demethylase 5B (KDM5B) is a histone demethylase that demethylates 'Lys-4' of histone H3, thereby playing a central role in histone code. KDM5B does not demethylate histone H3 'Lys-9' or H3 'Lys-27'. It demethylates trimethylated, dimethylated and monomethylated H3 'Lys-4' and acts as a transcriptional corepressor for FOXG1B and PAX9. It favors the proliferation of breast cancer cells by repressing tumor suppressor genes such as BRCA1 and HOXA5. In contrast, KDM5B may act as a tumor suppressor for melanoma and represses the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer-mediated transcriptional activation of the core clock component PER2.<br />Both these proteins are of great interest to study for NCGC and hence, we seek to profile 5 proprietary compounds against these proteins (each) using surface plasmon resonance. We have previously worked with this vendor who developed a custom, proprietary method for running the SPR against another target, IDH1. The results were used as part of the CBC project and we now expect to continue using these precise services to allow for continuity of data.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of this requirement is to obtain bioanalytical testing services to characterize PIP4K2 and KDM5B and then assess 5 compounds for each protein.</p>
<p>Scope of Work<br />Independently and not as an agent of the Federal Government, the contractor shall characterized ATP, ADP, and 1 control compound against three forms of PIP4K2 and characterizes full-length and truncated form of KDM5B. Upon completion of these services, the contractor shall profile 5 small molecules for PIP4K2 and KDM5 each using a proprietary method used previously against IDH1. The contract shall also provide binding constant to NCGC within 4 weeks of start of experiment. The NCATS Chemical Genomics Center NCGC is responsible for providing vendor with proteins and compounds.</p>
<p>(vii) Vendor shall provide a complete report and binding constants. NCGC will ship reagents after the award is made, vendor shall provide binding constant for each small molecule with 4 weeks after experiment has been started.</p>
<p>(viii) The provision at FAR clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. Selection of an Offeror for award will be on the basis of lowest price technically acceptable quote meeting the government's essential features as described herein.</p>
<p>Offeror(s) cost/price proposal will be evaluated for reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.</p>
<p><br />(x) The provision at FAR clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xi) FAR clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. An addendum to FAR clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xii) FAR clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xiii) There are no additional contract requirement(s) or terms and conditions (such as contract financing arrangements or warranty requirements) determined by the contracting officer to be necessary for this acquisition and consistent with customary commercial practices.</p>
<p>(xiv) The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) are not applicable to this requirement.</p>
<p>(xv) Responses to this solicitation must include sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities of providing the product or service. In addition, responses must include clear and convincing evidence of the offeror's capability of fulfilling the requirement as it relates to the salient characteristics.</p>
<p>The response should be practical, clear, and concise; should use quantitative terms whenever possible; should avoid qualitative adjectives; and should comprehensively address the requirements of this solicitation.</p>
<p><br />Evaluation Criteria <br />Technical Approach (60%)<br />&bull; Vendor shall be able meet to adhere to scope of work as outlined in this document.<br />Past Performance (40%)<br />&bull; Vendor shall demonstrate past performance.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert provision 1352.213?71, Instructions for Submitting Quotations under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold?Non-Commercial, or similar language in all solicitations for non-commercial purchase orders under the simplified acquisition threshold.

Flow down required in accordance with paragraph (d) of FAR clause 52.247-64. <BR> <BR>The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. <BR> <BR>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>(a) An agency protest may be filed with either: (1) The contracting officer, or (2) at a level above the contracting officer, with the appropriate agency Protest Decision Authority. See 64 FR 16,651 (April 6, 1999). (b) Agency protests filed with the Contracting Officer shall be sent to the following address: [Insert Contracting Officer name and Address] (c) Agency protests filed with the agency Protest Decision Authority shall be sent to the following address: [Insert appropriate Protest Decision Authority name and Address] (d) A complete copy of all agency protests, including all attachments, shall be served upon the Contract Law Division of the Office of the General Counsel within one day of filing a protest with either the Contracting Officer or the Protest Decision Authority. (e) Service upon the Contract Law Division shall be made as follows: U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, Chief, Contract Law Division, Room 5893, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. FAX: (202) 482-5858. <BR> <BR>(a) A protest may be filed with either the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or the Court of Federal Claims unless an agency protest has been filed. (b) A complete copy of all GAO or Court of Federal Claims protests, including all attachments, shall be served upon (i) the Contracting Officer, and (ii) the Contract Law Division of the Office of the General Counsel, within one day of filing a protest with either GAO or the Court of Federal Claims. (c) Service upon the Contract Law Division shall be made as follows: U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, Chief, Contract Law Division, Room 5893, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. FAX: (202) 482-5858. <BR> <BR>(a) Investigative Requirements for High and Moderate Risk Contracts. All contractor (and subcontractor) personnel proposed to be employed under a High or Moderate Risk contract shall undergo security processing by the Department's Office of Security before being eligible to work on the premises of any Department of Commerce owned, leased, or controlled facility in the United States or overseas, or to obtain access to a Department of Commerce IT system. All Department of Commerce security processing pertinent to this contract will be conducted at no cost to the contractor. The level of contract risk will determine the type and scope of such processing, as noted below. (1) Investigative requirements for Non-IT Service Contracts are: (i) High Risk?Background Investigation (BI). (ii) Moderate Risk?Moderate Background Investigation (MBI). (2) Investigative requirements for IT Service Contracts are: (i) High Risk IT?Background Investigation (BI). (ii) Moderate Risk IT?Background Investigation (BI). (b) In addition to the investigations noted above, non-U.S. citizens must have a pre-appointment check that includes an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency check. (c) Additional Requirements for Foreign Nationals (Non-U.S. Citizens). To be employed under this contract within the United States, non-U.S. citizens must have: (1) Official legal status in the United States; (2) Continuously resided in the United States for the last two years; and (3) Obtained advance approval from the servicing Security Officer of the contracting operating unit in consultation with the DOC Office of Security (OSY) headquarters. (OSY routinely consults with appropriate agencies regarding the use of non-U.S. citizens on contracts and can provide up-to-date information concerning this matter.) <BR> <BR>(d) Security Processing Requirement. Processing requirements for High and Moderate Risk Contracts are as follows: (1) The contractor must complete and submit the following forms to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR): (i) Standard Form 85P (SF-85P), Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions; (ii) FD-258, Fingerprint Chart with OPM's designation in the ORI Block; and (iii) Credit Release Authorization. (2) The Sponsor will ensure that these forms have been properly completed, initiate the CD-254, Contract Security Classification Specification, and forward the documents to the cognizant Security Officer. (3) Upon completion of security processing, the Office of Security, through the servicing Security Officer and the Sponsor, will notify the contractor in writing of an individual's eligibility to be provided access to a Department of Commerce facility or Department of Commerce IT system. (4) Security processing shall consist of limited personal background inquiries pertaining to verification of name, physical description, marital status, present and former residences, education, employment history, criminal record, personal references, medical fitness, fingerprint classification, and other pertinent information. For non-U.S. citizens, the Sponsor must request an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency check. It is the option of the Office of Security to repeat the security processing on any contract employee at its discretion. (e) Notification of Disqualifying Information. If the Office of Security receives disqualifying information on a contract employee, the COR will be notified. The Sponsor, in coordination with the Contracting Officer, will immediately remove the contract employee from duties requiring access to Departmental facilities or IT systems. Contract employees may be barred from working on the premises of a facility for any of the following: (1) Conviction of a felony crime of violence or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; (2) Falsification of information entered on security screening forms or on other documents submitted to the Department; (3) Improper conduct once performing on the contract, including criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct or other conduct prejudicial to the Government, regardless of whether the conduct was directly related to the contract; (4) Any behavior judged to pose a potential threat to Departmental information systems, personnel, property, or other assets. (f) Failure to comply with security processing requirements may result in termination of the contract or removal of contract employees from Department of Commerce facilities or denial of access to IT systems. (g) Access to National Security Information. Compliance with these requirements shall not be construed as providing a contract employee clearance to have access to national security information. (h) The contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts. <BR> <BR>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTING WITH ENTITIES THAT REQUIRE CERTAIN INTERNAL CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS?REPRESENTATION (FEB 2015) (a)	In accordance with section 743 of Division E, Title VII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Resolution Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS SET #1

1.	Factor 3, Relevant and Recent Past Performance (Tab D) on page 9 states it is "preferable to discuss similar type projects in excess of $2,000,000, but the magnitude of construction is listed as between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  Can past projects that fall within the listed magnitude of construction be submitted by the offeror and will they be considered?

This was an administrative error and was corrected in the revised solicitation 

2.	Please confirm that a Certified Independent Third Party (CITP) will be required for this project.

A CITP is not required for this requirement.   See revised solicitation where this area in the SOW were stricken out

3.	Numerous places within the RFP, Section A.2, reference Specification Section 00 11 21, but this specification section is nowhere to be found in the solicitation nor are there any other documents posted to FBO.  Please provide missing section as it essential to developing the proposal response.

Specification Section 00 11 21 is not required and the references were deleted from the revised solicitation.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">UPDATE 07 January 2016: If interested in attending the USAICoE Industry Day or participating in a&nbsp;one-on-one meeting with the HTASC team, please submit your request no later than Monday, 11 JANUARY 2016, 12:00 PM EST. Accordingly,&nbsp;"USAICoE INDUSTRY DAY" section updated below.<br /><br />DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Army Contracting Command - Orlando (ACC-ORL) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice (SSN) in support of U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICoE) requirements. This acquisition will be referred to as the Huachuca Training and Support Contract (HTASC). This SSN is associated with Special Notice and Request for Information (RFI) listed under solicitation number W900KKHTASC.</p>
<p>Potential NAICS for HTASC: 611430 Professional and Management Development Training; 928110 National Security - Military Training Schools.</p>
<p>Based on the requirements, the Government is considering a single award, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The Government has provided a DRAFT HTASC "common"/basic Performance Work Statement (PWS, Attachment 01 to this SSN) along with several additional DRAFT PWSs that may be Task Orders under the HTASC single award IDIQ contract if this was determined to be the best acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The Government is seeking information regarding relevant experience and capabilities of industry partners interested in performing this potential requirement. Responses to this SSN will be used to gain insight from industry's experience performing similar requirements and to analyze the information in order to develop a contract vehicle (or multiple contract vehicles) capable of supporting the described mission. Based on this assessment, the Government will finalize an acquisition strategy to generate a formal draft solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government encourages industry to provide comments and suggestions relating to acquisition strategy to include: NAICS, contract type, contract structure, teaming arrangements, small business participation/set asides, etc.</p>
<p>The Government also encourages industry to provide questions, comments, and suggestions relating to the Performance Work Statements (PWSs) provided. Questions received will be consolidated, answered and, if deemed valuable information for all interested parties, will be posted at a later date on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. The Government will not disclose the identity of the potential offeror asking the questions.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>USAICoE's training requirements were previously supported by Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) through the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) contract and the Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contract. The majority of USAICoE's Warfighter FOCUS (WFF) requirements will be supported by the new HTASC.</p>
<p>NOTE: Some of USAICoE's WFF/SETA requirements (previously discussed under the Special Notice/RFI for HTASC) will be supported by other contract vehicles (to be announced through separate FBO announcements) allowing the Government to focus HTASC's scope on USAICoE's core mission: Military Intelligence training. Requirements anticipated to be outside of HTASC include:</p>
<p>- USAICoE Chief Information Office (CIO) - G6;<br />- Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) - Solicitation Number W900KK-16-R-0024; and<br />- Knowledge Based Assistance and Advisory Services to include: USAICoE Knowledge Management Office; USAICoE Reserve Forces Office (RFO); USAICoE Safety requirement; and USAICoE Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC).</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>

PLEASE RESEND any communications that were sent to this email.<br /><br /><br />DESCRIPTION:
<p>Army Contracting Command - Orlando (ACC-ORL) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice (SSN) in support of United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence (USAACE) requirements. This acquisition will be referred to as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). NOTE: This SSN was associated with Special Notice and Request for Information (RFI) listed under solicitation number W900KKHTASC. UAS requirements will be supported by a separate contract vehicle now associated with this SSN's solicitation number W900KK-16-R-0024.</p>
<p>Potential North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for UAS: 611512 Flight Training.</p>
<p>The Government has provided a DRAFT UAS Performance Work Statement (PWS, Attachment 01 to this SSN).</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The Government is seeking information regarding relevant experience and capabilities of industry partners interested in performing this potential requirement. Responses to this SSN will be used to gain insight from industry's experience performing similar requirements and to analyze the information in order to develop a contract vehicle capable of supporting the described mission. Based on this assessment, the Government will finalize an acquisition strategy and generate a formal draft solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government encourages industry to provide comments and suggestions relating to acquisition strategy to include: NAICS, contract type, contract structure, teaming arrangements, small business participation/set asides, etc.</p>
<p>The Government also encourages industry to provide questions, comments, and suggestions relating to the PWS provided.

The Government will not disclose the identity of the potential offeror asking the questions.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>USAACE's training requirements were previously supported by Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) through the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) contract and the Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contract.

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) - Fort Eustis is conducting market research to ascertain the availability of interested and capable firms to provide exercise support, analysis, and instructional and educational services in support of the U.S. Army War College (USAWC), Carlisle Barracks, PA. USAWC's mission supports the Army, combatant commands, and interagency requirements for senior leader education, strategic communication, research and publication. A multi-award Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract type is being contemplated. It is anticipated that there will be one (1) base year and four (4) one (1) year option periods.
<p>General tasks within the scope of work may include the following:</p>
<p>Task 1: Exercise Support</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide support to various types of exercises, to include educational instruction, which examines issues and decision making processes at the strategic level, interagency level (including interagency activities), operational level, as defined in Chapter II, paragraph 2, Joint Publication 3-0 (17 September 2006, Incorporating Change 1, 13 February 2008) and for the strategic use of military power in joint and combined operations. These exercises, however, reach down only to and include the level of major operations but exclude issues related to battles; they also exclude issues dealing with the tactical level. The CSLD groups such exercises into four major categories: war-fighting, operations other than war, educational, and senior level decision making. Such exercises are used by CSLD and its customers to support education, training, decision-making, analysis, or planning.</p>
<p>Task 2: Analysis</p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct analysis at the strategic and interagency level and for the strategic use of military forces in joint and combined operations for CSLD and its customers. Analysis is defined as examining issues and providing recommendations; examining problems and providing solutions; examining strategic and regional policies and programs; examining decision making processes; researching to gather data and information; researching to identify potential issues; researching to develop educational materials; and modifying or developing methodologies.<br /><br />Task 3: Instructional and Educational Support</p>
<p>The contractor shall design, develop, document, and execute educational courses. These subjects include Joint operations, educational gaming, Army's Title 10 roles, political-military interfaces, all aspects of the Joint phased planning (phases 0-5) and their related sub-activities, theater setting, joint and multinational warfighting, cyber warfare, and worldwide threats. This shall require the contractor to research, create outline curriculum, facilitate and support courses, including planning meetings and workshops. Contractor will utilize standard USAWC, US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), or other Army training and education development and documentation systems, as specified by the customer, for training and educational material development and documentation, as well as submission of course attendee documentation. The contractor shall review and update, as required, all course material prior to commencement of the course and will update and revise all course material after completion of the course and government approval of after-action review/lessons-learned recommendations.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research. The purpose of the sources sought notice is to determine interest and capability of potential qualified vendors relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 611710 Educational Support Services.</p>
<p>Interested respondents should submit a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum) clearly demonstrating the firm's ability to fulfill the government's requirements. A generic capability statement is not acceptable. Please review the requirements listed below. At a minimum, the package shall address the following:</p>

Statements should describe the dollar value, indicate whether your firm acted as the prime or subcontractor, list a customer point of contact with phone number, and provide description of the experience and how the referenced experience relates to the services described herein.</p>
<p><br />4. Resources available including corporate management and currently employed personnel to be assigned to tasks under this effort to include professional qualifications and specific experience of such personnel.</p>
<p><br />5. Management approach to staffing this effort with qualified personnel which should address current hires available for assignment to this effort.</p>
<p><br />6. State the lead time (days) necessary for your firm to begin performance after award.</p>
<p><br />7. Any suggestions or comments about the NAICS code selection, contract type, or effort in general.</p>

<DESC>A CONCESSION BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY FOR PASSENGER FERRY, EVENING PASSENGER FERRY, AND FOOD AND BEVERAGE SERVICE AT FORT SUMTER NATIONAL MONUMENT
<p>The National Park Service (NPS) will issue a prospectus for solicitation of offers for a 10 year concession contract to provide for Passenger Ferry, Evening Passenger Ferry, and Food and Beverage Service at Fort Sumter National Monument</p>
<p>Fort Sumter is one of the most iconic sites in American military history as the location where Confederate forces fired the first shots of the Civil War upon Federal troops on April 12, 1861. The Park preserves the remnants of Fort Sumter and commemorates and interprets the opening battle of the Civil War and the Fort's role during the Civil War. The War Department transferred Fort Sumter to the National Park Service on April 28, 1948. The National Park Service accepted jurisdiction of Fort Moultrie in 1960.</p>
<p>The Park includes four geographical areas: Fort Sumter, Fort Moultrie (the site of the first American naval victory over the British in 1776), the Historic Coast Guard Station, and the Visitor Education Center at Liberty Square ("Visitor Education Center"). The Visitor Education Center at Liberty Square, located in downtown Charleston, SC, serves as one departure point for the ferry services to Fort Sumter. Fort Moultrie and the Historic Coast Guard Station are located on Sullivan's Island, SC. <br /><br />Visitors can reach Fort Sumter by ferry service or private boat. Visitors reach Liberty Square, Fort Moultrie, and the Historic Coast Guard Station by automobile.</p>
<p>Fort Sumter National Monument continues to represent an iconic attraction within the Charleston area, serving hundreds of thousands of visitors annually. Additional information on Fort Sumter National Monument can be found at http://www.nps.gov/fosu/</p>
<p>The concession opportunity consists of year-round passenger ferry service, including onboard food and beverage service, and seasonal evening passenger ferry service to Fort Sumter. The ferry will operate in Charleston Harbor and depart from Service-owned docks at Liberty Square adjacent to the Fort Sumter Visitor Education Center and a second ferry departure site in the Mount Pleasant/East Cooper River area.</p>
<p>SITE VISIT</p>
<p>The Service will host a site visit for organizations interested in bidding on this opportunity on Wednesday, January 13, 2016. The site visit will begin at 10:00 AM at Liberty Square with a visit to Fort Sumter and continue afterwards with a visit to Mount Pleasant Waterfront Park and Patriots Point.</p>
<p>The site visit provides interested organizations an overview of the concession operation, along with a tour of the Concession Facilities associated with the Draft Contract. If you plan to attend the site visit, please contact:</p>
<p>Attn: Tony Paladino, Concession Management Specialist<br />Fort Sumter National Monument<br />1214 Middle Street<br />Sullivan's Island, SC 29482<br />anthony_paladino@nps.gov <br />(843) 732-5025</p>
<p>Please RSVP at least one week in advance of the site visit. When registering, you must provide your name, the name of the organization interested in bidding that you represent, the primary contact for the organization and the number of people in your party. All parties attending the site visit must disclose to the Service the names of the interested organizations engaging their services. The Service will provide further information and additional directions by return email message to the primary contact.</p>
<p>All offers must be received by the NPS at the address listed in the prospectus no later than 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, March 31, 2016, in order to be evaluated and considered for an award of a concession contract. The prospectus describes the business opportunity and includes the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract. <br />The prospectus is available on the NPS website at http://www.concessions.nps.gov/prospectuses.htm, or you can receive a hard copy for $35.00. To request a copy of the prospectus, send a check for $35.00 payable to the National Park Service to Mark Morgan at the address listed below. This amount includes an administrative charge and Fed Ex shipping fee for each prospectus. Please include a physical address (no post office box) and telephone number. You may also pick up a printed copy at the Superintendent's Office at Park Headquarters for $30.00 (checks only). If you are planning to submit a proposal and have obtained your prospectus from the website, we recommend that you advise Mark Morgan, Concessions Management Specialist, Southeast Region, NPS, AFC, 1924 Building, 100 Alabama Street, S.W., Atlanta, GA 30303 at (404) 507-5638 or e-mail at Mark_Morgan@nps.gov of your interest so your contact information can be placed on a mailing list to receive future responses to questions or amendments to the prospectus. Those receiving a hard copy or who are on the mailing list will be provided with any additional information specific to the prospectus in writing. The same information is posted to the above mentioned website. Inquiries can be directed to Mark Morgan at (404) 507-5638 or e-mail at Mark_Morgan@nps.gov. No telephone requests for the prospectus will be honored.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AMENDMENT NO. 1-SOLICITATION #: CC-FOSU001-17</span></strong></p>
<p>The following updates the Prospectus issued by the National Park Service on December 10, 2015. The updates address the prohibition on the sale of water packaged in individual disposable containers, the provision of water bottle refilling stations on vessels, and an adjustment to the minimum franchise fee due to the additional requirements and prohibitions. The updates also adjust response requirements related to a second departure site.</p>
<p>1) Summary of Business Opportunity, Page 2, Franchise Fee</p>
<p>Delete the following, in its entirety:<br />"The minimum franchise fee is sixteen and three-tenths percent (16.3%) of the Concessioner's annual gross receipts"</p>
<p>Replace with the following:<br />"The minimum franchise fee is sixteen percent (16.0%) of the Concessioner's annual gross receipts"</p>
<p><br />2) Business Opportunity, Page 7, Overview of Concession Services and Locations, Food and Beverage Operations</p>
<p>Add the following:<br />"The Draft Contract prohibits the sale of water packaged in individual disposable containers of less than one gallon within the Park and on all Concessioner vessels used to provide the services under the Draft Contract."</p>
<p><br />3) Business Opportunity, Page 8, Second Ferry Departure Site in the Mount Pleasant/East Cooper River Area</p>
<p>Delete the first bullet of the third paragraph, in its entirety:<br />"Charleston Harbor Marina located adjacent to the Patriot's Point docks used by the Existing Concessioner. Charleston Harbor Marina is a privately owned and operated facility."</p>
<p>Replace the first bullet of the third paragraph with the following:<br />"Charleston Harbor Marina located adjacent to the docks used by the Existing Concessioner at Patriot's Point. Charleston Harbor Marina is owned by the State of South Carolina, overseen by Patriot's Point Development Authority and operated by Charleston Harbor Marina, Inc. under a lease. "</p>
<p>4) Business Opportunity, Page 8, Second Ferry Departure Site in the Mount Pleasant/East Cooper River Area</p>
<p>Delete the fourth paragraph, in its entirety:<br />"Each Offeror must negotiate with and secure use of one of these or another site from the appropriate controlling entity. The Service contacted each of the controlling entities for the three sites, requesting confirmation that each would be willing to negotiate with parties interested in this concession opportunity. Appendix L includes letters from some of the site owners confirming their willingness to negotiate terms of use with the Concessioner."</p>
<p>Replace the fourth paragraph with the following:<br />"Each Offeror must negotiate with and secure use of one of these or another site from the appropriate controlling entity. The Service is aware, however, that the entities owning or controlling these potential second departure sites may not be willing or able to negotiate lease terms with Offerors prior to the selection of the successful Offeror, and the Service recognizes that some Offerors may have existing legal control of a second departure site while others may need to negotiate such control after the selection of successful Offeror. As such, Secondary Selection Factor 2 provides the option to respond differently depending on each Offeror's level of control of a second departure site. The Service prefers you either have legal control of the second departure site, or describe multiple, potential locations (that meet the minimum requirements described in Section 21 of the Draft Contract and Section 5)E) of the Operating Plan, Exhibit B to the Draft Contract) to improve your negotiating position in securing the second departure site post selection. See Secondary Selection Factor 2 of the Proposal Package for further information."</p>
<p><br />5) Business Opportunity, Page 11, Future Ridership, Revenue, and Expense Projections, Franchise Fee</p>
<p>Delete the following, in its entirety:<br />"The minimum franchise fee is sixteen and three-tenths percent (16.3%) of the Concessioner's annual gross receipts"</p>
<p>Replace with the following:<br />"The minimum franchise fee is sixteen percent (16.0%) of the Concessioner's annual gross receipts"</p>
<p><br />6) Business Opportunity, Page 11, Initial Investment, Vessels</p>
<p>Add the following:<br />"The Operating Plan also requires the Concessioner to provide a station for visitors to refill water bottles on all primary vessels. The Concessioner must submit its plan in writing for the water bottle refilling stations to the Service for approval within 60 days following the effective date of the Contract."</p>
<p><br />7) Operating Plan, Section 5)B)3) Minimum Vessel Requirements</p>
<p>Delete the third bullet of Section 5)B)3)(b) Access by Persons with Disabilities, in its entirety:<br />"Drinking Water. The vessel onboard drinking fountains must be accessible to persons with disabilities or the Concessioner can provide drinking water directly to persons with disabilities using bottles or cups provided by staff onboard the vessels."</p>
<p>Replace the third bullet of Section 5)B)3)(b) Access by Persons with Disabilities:<br />"Drinking Water. The vessel onboard drinking fountains and water bottle refilling stations must be accessible to persons with disabilities or the Concessioner can provide drinking water directly to persons with disabilities using cups provided by staff onboard the vessels."</p>

<DESC>This modification/amendment to the titled presolicitation corrects the Part number (P/N)&nbsp;for the Lavatory Service Cart from LC180-RJG to 950003. The Response date has also been updated due to this correction. See below.<br /><br />The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst intends to procure on a non-competitive basis twenty-two (22) Lavatory Service Cart P/N&nbsp;950003 and sixteen (16) Fly-Away Tow Bar P/N 001700. These units are required to support the P8-A aircraft, outfit the Royal Australian Air Force, and fill deficits for the United States Navy. The Government intends to issue a sole source contract to Aero Specialties, 11175 W. Emerald St, Boise ID 83713-8932. Under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, this firm is considered the only responsible source to perform this effort. Aero Specialties owns the drawings and since they worked directly with the Navy to generate custom units to meet their needs, it is the only Original Equipment Manufacturer for these two items. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all responses received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The U.S. Embassy and Consulates in Bangladesh requires a secure environment to conduct their mission.  The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement.

Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government).
<p>All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract.</p>

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) only. It is not a solicitation nor does it guarantee a solicitation will be issued. This is an RFI for the purpose of conducting market research to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition. Submission of any information in response to this sources sought notice is COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.<br /><br />BACKGROUND: The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe) is currently performing an independent review for the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA's) Office of Policy regarding the process by which roadside safety hardware is deemed eligible for Federal-aid reimbursement. As a part of Volpe's evaluation, Volpe is requesting information from parties involved in the development, evaluation, and implementation of roadside safety hardware to obtain feedback and input related to their role(s) within the process. Volpe is currently looking at the development, evaluation, funding, implementation, and assessment processes with respect to roadside safety hardware. This evaluation involves examining the current Federal-aid reimbursement eligibility process for roadside safety hardware from the initial development of new or modified hardware through the installation and in-service evaluation phases. This review may result in improvement/change recommendations being made to FHWA or other organizations involved in the roadside hardware evaluation process.<br /><br />SCOPE: Volpe is seeking information on the processes by which roadside safety hardware is developed, evaluated, tested, implemented, and assessed.<br /><br />In Volpe's ongoing review of the roadside safety hardware evaluation process, Volpe has generally identified four phases of hardware development, evaluation, and implementation as follows:<br /><br />1. Development, evaluation and testing of new or modified roadside safety hardware;<br />2. Consideration of Federal-aid reimbursement eligibility;<br />3. Consideration of State acceptance; and,<br />4. Hardware installation and in-service assessments.<br /><br />Note that not every phase is required for each hardware development effort. For example, FHWA does not require a letter of Federal-aid reimbursement eligibility for a piece of hardware to be eligible for Federal-aid reimbursement.<br /><br />This RFI invites parties to submit comments related to any of these phases, including, but not limited to, the following:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Designing and/or modifying roadside safety hardware devices;<br />2.&nbsp; Development and implementation of roadside safety hardware testing criteria and procedures;<br />3.&nbsp; Testing and/or analysis of roadside safety hardware;<br />4.&nbsp; Federal-aid reimbursement eligibility determination process for roadside safety hardware;<br />5.&nbsp; State evaluation processes for roadside safety hardware;<br />6.&nbsp; Installation and maintenance of roadside safety hardware;<br />7.&nbsp; Inventory tracking of roadside safety hardware;<br />8.&nbsp; In-service performance evaluations of roadside safety hardware;<br />9.&nbsp; Sharing of relevant roadside safety data among stakeholders; and/or,<br />10.&nbsp; Recently-implemented changes to the roadside safety hardware evaluation process<br /><br />This RFI is intended to better inform Volpe as to the existing roadside safety hardware development and evaluation process, and to assist Volpe in identifying potential areas for improvement within the process.<br /><br />Interested parties&nbsp;should submit a capabilities package describing&nbsp;their process(es) that addresses the requirements&nbsp;of this RFI. Additionally, the Volpe Center is interested in a rough order of magnitude for each described process, as applicable. The preferred format for documentation is PDF. There is no page limit for responses to this RFI, however, it is requested only the&nbsp;pertinent information addressing the needs of this RFI be&nbsp;provided. Each response should reference this RFI's title, and provide the name and contact information (company, phone, email, etc.) of the submitter, at a minimum. Interested parties are requested to respond to this announcement in writing as soon as possible but not later than&nbsp;29 January 2016. Telephone requests will not be honored. All responses should be sent via e-mail to tammy.taylor@dot.gov.<br /><br />The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a competitive acquisition. The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this notice and submittals will not be returned to the sender. For information about the Volpe Center, please refer to its&nbsp;website at http://www.volpe.dot.gov.<br />

<p>Project Title: N656 Renovate Crossroads Food Court</p>
<p>Project Location: MCAS Iwakuni, Japan</p>
<p>Project NAICS: 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction</p>
<p>Project Magnitude: Between &yen;500,000,000 and &yen;1,000,000,000 Japanese YEN</p>
<p>Project Description:</p>
<p>This project will provide design and renovation of the existing Crossroads Food Court at MCAS Iwakuni, Japan. The scope of work requires renovations of approximately 17,000 sf of space within the existing facility to create a larger open seating area, as well as enlarging and reconfiguring existing food service areas. Work will include demolition of existing walls and barriers to reclaim additional space in the food court seating area. New construction will be required to reconfigure an open seating area and relocate beverage stations to periphery of the space. New finishes will be provided throughout to include acoustical tile, pedant and accent lighting, painted walls and wainscoting, wood base, and vinyl or ceramic tile floors. In kitchen/food service areas, demolition of existing walls will be required to allow for construction of larger food service areas. Spaces will be reconfigured with increased square footage, trench floor drainage, and new built-in refrigeration. New service counters and point-of-sale stations will also be constructed. The electrical system will be replaced in its entirety to accommodate new operational needs and accommodate the new physical layouts. Additional upgrades will be made to meet life safety and regulatory requirements. This project will also include installation of Government furnished equipment items.&nbsp; The expected groundbreaking date for this project will be July 2017.</p>
<p>Procurement method:</p>

<DESC>This amendment is being issued for the following reasons:
<p>1) This is to notify all potential offerors that the Request for Proposal (RFP) release date MUST be extended again. Based on updated milestone projections, the RFP release date is expected to be early to mid-April 2016.</p>
<p>2) This notice also provides a revision to our previous notice dated 9 November 2015. We have changed the location of a planned event due to vendor feedback. The pre-solicitation conference will now be held at Base Kodiak, Kodiak, Alaska soon after the release of the RFP and concurrent with the site visit. The oral presentations, for those who make the competitive range after evaluation of the offers, will still be held in Alameda, California. Dates for both of these events will be listed in the eventual solicitation.</p>
<p>3) In addition, as emphasized throughout this process, the USCG has several goals with this new solicitation. We have significantly updated/revised the PWS from the current contract to make it more performance-based, many of your previous comments resulted in revisions to the updated draft PWS (copy attached). Another goal with this upcoming contract is to make it as efficient as possible in managing the work requirements while still allowing for flexibility in our austere budget environment. To create this flexibility a revised (draft) Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) schedule has been developed. This is also attached for your comment. We need to make sure vendors can accurately and with certainty propose on our requirements.</p>
<p>As such, we appreciate if potential offerors would review and comment on our draft CLIN schedule of prices and draft PWS. Specifically we hope you will give us feedback on how easy is it to develop prices using this CLIN structure including how much confidence you can have in the accuracy of prices. Any feedback you provide is welcomed. If you have any questions, comments, recommendations, and/or suggestions about this CLIN schedule breakdown or PWS, please email Michael T Hassett at: michael.t.hassett@uscg.mil. No special forms or format are needed for these responses, however, please be detailed in your responses/questions to me and cite the section page(s) you are referring to. Send me those questions/comments no later than close of business 28 January 2016. We appreciate your patience and help with this matter.</p>

<p>Synopsis: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY AND YOUR RESPONSE IS NOT AN OFFER AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY ANY COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION OF ANY RESPONSE TO THIS MARKET SURVEY, OR TO CONTRACT FOR SUPPLIES/SERVICES.</p>
<p>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting market research for the Medium Range Thermal Bi-Ocular (MRTB) AN/PAS-28 to address current and future obsolescence issues, thereby extending its lifecycle. The objective is to develop cost-effective replacement parts to sustain MRTBs throughout the remaining lifecycle for a period of 10 years. <br /><br />The Optical Instrument Eyepiece Assembly (NSN: 5855-01-580-6721) and Detector Assembly (NSN: 6350-01-581-3974) are obsolete. MARCORSYSCOM seeks potential technology design solutions to produce the assemblies and correct obsolescence issues for the eyepiece and detector, including other components as appropriate. Acceptable solutions may include a redesign/reconfiguration of the circuit board processing stack and MARCORSYSCOM may accept solutions that bring the MRTB to the current state of technology. <br /><br />MARCORSYSCOM will provide a limited number of MRTB AN/PAS-28s as Government Furnished Equipment to develop, test, evaluate, and validate the solution. Government Furnished Equipment is unavailable to support responses to this RFI.</p>
<p>Vendors responding to this RFI should provide a White Paper detailing its approach to solving the MRTB obsolescence issues. Responses should also include a proposed timeline from contract award through system validation and provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for pricing.</p>
<p>Written responses can be in any format, but electronic media must be in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat formats. RFI responses may be printed or submitted on a CD. The response must include the company name, Point of Contact information, DUNS number and CAGE code.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation announcement. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement. The Government will use responses to this RFI to make appropriate acquisition decisions.</p>
<p>Responses are due within 45 calendar days after this RFI's publication date. Please electronically submit responses to: jennifer.haveron@usmc.mil. All responses will be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a potential future acquisition. This RFI should not be construed as commitment by the Government for any purpose. Response is strictly voluntary; no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this RFI or any follow-up information requests. If a solicitation is released, it will be via FedBizOpps (http://www.fedbizopps.gov).</p>
