<DESC>The United States Coast Guard, Operation Systems Center,   intends to award on a limited source basis, contracts with Globe Wireless, Foster City, CA, and WLO Shipcom, Mobile, AL for message service from ships at sea to the Coast Guard Operations Systems Center in Kearneysville, WV, via Coast Guard paid circuits.  It is further intended to establish each contract for a base year (12 months), with 4 12-month options.  To compensate these public coast stations for the handling and delivery of AMVER messages, the Coast Guard will pay the radio stations directly for delivery of each AMVER message. The Contractors will use delivery invoices to bill the Coast Guard for all AMVER messages electronically delivered. It is believed that these 2 radio stations are the sole remaining Coast Station operators in the United States that operate the type of system needed by the Coast Guard. There used to be many operators over the years; however, they have gone out of the business or been sold to these 2 remaining operators. Many ships have other methods of communicating directly with whomever they want and do not need the "middle man" services provided by WLO and Globe. Globe relays SITOR messages that are sent by participating vessels. WLO Shipcom relays both Morse Code as well as SITORS. WLO is the only coast station that relays Morse Code. The Government intends to negotiate with only these 2 sources under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). The reason justifying this limited source procurement is that the Goverment believes that only these 2 responsible sources can furnish the services that will satisfy the Government's requirements. Any firm that believes it can satisfy the services described above are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer. Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to satisy the Coast Guard's requirements. All responses received by the close of business on October 20, 2003 will be considered. Any future action based on responses to this notice will be at the sole discretion of the Government. Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail or fax (304/262-5997).

<RESPDATE>102203
<ARCHDATE>10012004
<CONTACT>Mathew A. Ridolfi Contract Specialist 7037871813     Mathew.Ridolfi@mms.gov;
<DESC>A - Prevention Content for ODPHP Websites and Print Materials DESCRIPTION: The Department of Interior (DOI)/GovWorks, on behalf of Office of Disease Prevention and Heath Promotion (ODPHP), is seeking a potential contractor to undertake research and evaluation activities related to consumer health information about prevention.  PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE ANNOUNCEMENT CAREFULLY. BACKGROUND:   The Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP) is located in the Office of Public Health and Science, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ODPHP was established by Congress in 1976 by Public Law 94-317 (the National Consumer Health Information and Health Promotion Act) to provide a central focus for stimulating and coordinating Federal activities in prevention. ODPHP provides leadership for disease prevention and health promotion. It collaborates with other Federal agencies and departments as well as the public and privates sectors in developing, monitoring, and/or coordinating national prevention initiatives that can help ensure healthier lives for all Americans.   ODPHP also coordinates other cross-cutting HHS activities in disease prevention and health promotion, including public health issues related to nutrition. It also provides leadership and coordination in consumer health information, health communication, e-Health, and the national health information infrastructure.   Recent advances in information and communication technologies provide vast new opportunities to broaden health communication. The World Wide Web, in particular, is causing a major shift in the Nation's approach to the information age, encompassing radical changes in distance-based education and learning, marketing, commerce, information access, entertainment, and health.   ODPHP has been a leader in online health communication with www.healthfinder.gov and other Web sites managed by ODPHP. The convergence of the advances in interactive systems and the use of highly sophisticated health communication strategies will permit ODPHP to more effectively reach intended audiences of consumers with key information, tools and recommendations about prevention.  SCOPE OF WORK:  The Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has received set-aside evaluation funds to undertake research and evaluation activities related to consumer health information.  ODPHP intends to research the prevention information needs of diverse audiences and assess possible prevention messages and materials for diverse audience segments. Developing and disseminating prevention information to the public is a core HHS activity.  Prevention is currently a departmental priority, and there is a tremendous opportunity to improve the variety and quality of the prevention information that HHS makes available to the public. In addition to traditional print materials, HHS is increasingly using the Internet as a main channel to reach the public with prevention information that could combine text, audio, graphics and interactive tools into a package of health "content." ODPHP is seeking a contractor to assess audience prevention information needs and existing sets of prevention information for consumers; revise and pilot test print and Internet-based prevention health content; and propose a content development format, guidelines and evaluation plan for future content development.  The period of performance of the resultant contract will be 18 months with an estimated Level of Effort of 9,200 hours. The Government anticipates a time and materials contract. IN ORDER TO COMPETE FOR THIS CONTRACT, Offerors must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, not later than 3:00PM, October 22, 2003, a Capabilities Statement describing in detail:  (1) your key personnel and program manager (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the work) with their qualifications and specific demonstrable experience in research on health communication; Internet health information; Internet evaluation methodologies; and effective communication with diverse audiences.  (2) your organizational experience in research on health communication; Internet health information; Internet evaluation methodologies; and effective communication with diverse audiences; and (3) specific references (including contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with point of contact & telephone number) for previous related work in health communication; Internet health information; Internet evaluation methodologies; and effective communication with diverse audiences that your key personnel or organization have performed within the last two years. If you believe the Government may find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your organization to address the problem. After review of all Capabilities Statements, those offerors deemed "Best Qualified" will be provided additional proposal instructions and contract requirements.  GovWorks intends to notify offerors approximately 10 days after receipt of capability statements, of whether or not you are considered "Best Qualified."  Each offeror's capabilities Statement will be  evaluated based on the following:  Factors A and B which are in descending order of importance.  Sub-factors listed under each factor are of equal importance to each other. A) KEY PERSONNEL--key persons' skills, abilities and experience within the areas of health communication; Internet health information; Internet evaluation methodologies; and effective communication with diverse audiences; B) ORGANAZATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND PAST PERFORMANCE -- your organization's experience and past performance (including number, size, and complexity of similar projects, technical excellence, adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of program management, willingness to cooperate when difficulties arise, willingness to partner with the Government in providing robust solutions, general compliance with the terms of the contracts, and acceptability of delivered product and service rendered).  REFERENCES WILL BE CHECKED.  Offerors shall submit their Capabilities Statement in original and six (6) copies to Mathew Ridolfi, Contract Specialist, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS-2500, Herndon Virginia 20170-4817.  In addition, offerors shall include one electronic copy on CD-ROM.  Time of receipt of submissions will be determined by the time received in the Procurement Operations Branch, Herndon, Virginia.  Questions should be faxed to Mathew Ridolfi at (703) 787-1813 or e-mailed to Mathew.ridolfi@mms.gov.  Questions should be provided no later than October 10, 2003.  All correspondence should include this RFP number (0404RP74655), full name/company name, address and phone and fax numbers. Requests or questions by telephone are strongly discouraged.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for data to evaluate the Panasonic Lithium Ion CGR18650C cell.  A cell performance analysis and complete sizing analysis of the battery for the Advanced Hydraulic Power System (AHPS) upgrade per the End Item Specification for Small Cell Battery for the Orbiter Electric Auxillary Power Unit must be completed.  The scope of the effort involves performance acceptance tests, electrical and thermal performance tests, and electrical, mechanical, and thermal abuse tests.  The 3 main deliverables are: 1) a test report with an electrical sizing analysis; 2) a battery necessary to meet the EAPU specification; and, 3) 100 fresh cells.   NASA/JSC intends to sole source the purchase from AEA Technologies, PLC in accordance with FAR part 13.106, supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical because AEA Technologies, PLC has exclusive design, test, and product rights to Panasonic's Lithium Ion cell. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on October 22, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS) requires the short term lease of narrow bodied (single aisle) large passenger/transport jet aircraft.

The aircraft will generally depart and return to one of three designated points: 1) Oklahoma City, OK; 2) Mesa, AZ; 3) Alexandria, LA; however, JPATS may require alternative sites for positioning/re-positioning of the aircraft.  It is estimated that each of the aircraft will be flown approximately 15 to 30 hours per week.  The contractor shall provide the aircraft, all maintenance (including line maintenance/line servicing/aircraft cleaning), logistics support, and insurance.  

JPATS anticipates acquiring these aircraft under a multiple award, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract, utilizing individual delivery orders to acquire aircraft for each of its three operational sites.  Each IDIQ contract awarded will be for a one (1) year base and two (2) one-year options.

Offerors will be evaluated on their (1) Past Performance on similar projects, (2) Price, and (3) To be considered for award, the offeror submitting the proposal must clearly demonstrate at the time of proposal submission that it has the ability to provide aircraft maintained under an FAA approved maintenance program for a certificated Part 121/125 operator or through an FAA Part 145 Certificated Repair Station utilizing the original manufacturer's Maintenance Planning Document (MPD).  Only those proposals, which meet the criteria, shall be evaluated.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 12, the EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (Ann Arbor, Michigan) will procure a Gas Laboratory Analysis and Traceability System. As part of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, new emissions regulations have been implemented for vehicles and engines.  Many of these regulations require sophisticated and adaptable emission measurement systems.  As a result, the EPA National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) has undertaken a comprehensive program to implement new and refined test systems to enhance the capabilities to conduct low level emissions testing, of the highest precision and accuracy, on a broad range of vehicles and engines.  In its role as a National Laboratory for the measurement of regulated emissions, and energy consumption, related to the transportation sector,  NVFEL plays a critical role in the standardization of those measurements.  To support that role, EPA seeks to purchase a combined analytical, data acquisition and database system to establish, document and control the official concentration, and NIST traceability, of internal gas standards and challenge standards.  Since this system is expected to form the backbone of traceability for gas analyzers, for vehicle and engine testing operations at NVFEL, EPA has named this system the Gas Laboratory Analysis and Traceability System. The Gas Laboratory Analysis and Traceability System shall include specific gas analyzers that provide the highest levels of precision and accuracy available for the intended purpose.  In addition the system will include computer system(s) for analysis control, data acquisition and information processing, equipped with a standard color laser printer, a specialty printer for printing adhesive gas cylinder labels with bar codes, and a bar code reader for rapid identification and verification of gas cylinder numbers.  The computer system(s) shall facilitate operation of the analysis bench, aide in the quality control of the gas naming process, collect and store measurement data and maintain a database of gas standard information for efficient information retrieval, quality tracking and traceability documentation purposes.   The Gas Laboratory Analysis and Traceability System shall be located in the existing Gas Laboratory at NVFEL, and shall interface with the existing NVFEL Laboratory Network System (LNS) via an EPA-provided Interface Computer (IFC).  The successful contractor shall be responsible for installation of system. This procurement includes three options. Dual Sample Port (OPTION 1) The contractor shall provide all necessary hardware and software modifications necessary to allow for connection and disconnection of one cylinder from the Gas Laboratory Analysis and Traceability System while another is being analyzed, for the purpose of improving operational efficiency. Additional Gas Dividers (OPTION 2) The contractor shall provide one to four additional gas dividers identical to the items delivered as part of the base system. Extended Service Contract (OPTION 3) The contractor shall provide and Extended Service Contract, renewable every year or every two years, for a period of 5 years from the date of acceptance.  This option shall be exercisable for up to 90 days after final system acceptance by EPA. This procurement will be made using "Best Value" evaluation criteria and Full and Open Competition for everything in the SOW including options. The solicitation should be issued by September 8, 2003 on the website listed below.  A "DRAFT" of the proposed Statement of Work for this requirement can be found at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  Interested parties are invited to review the "DRAFT" SOW and provide any comments by August 29, 2003 via fax to David Plagge (513) 487-2107 or email at Plagge.David@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Gifford Pinchot National Forest is in the process of preparing a Request for Quotes for a road project located in the East Fork of the Lewis River.  USFS Rd 4200 is an existing single lane, gravel surfaced road constructed adjacent to the East Fork of the Lewis River.  This project is intended to reduce the amount of road generated sediment that reaches the East Fork, an important native fisheries stream.  This project is approximately 1 mile in length and is the first of several sediment-reducing / fisheries improvement projects anticipated over the next few years. This project is expected to advertise in the spring of 2004 and construct during the 2004 construction season, July 15 thru Sept 30.

SCOPE OF CONTRACT : The preliminary government estimate is between $ 100,000 and $ 150,000.

The primary focus of this sediment-reducing project is the existing gravel and native material subgrade. The existing subgrade will be reconditioned to remove existing pot holes and washboards and to increase usable width where necessary.  3 inch minus base rock will be added to short sections of the existing, reconditioned subgrade to improve drainage.  A 4 inch compacted depth lift of  ¾ inch minus crushed rock will be placed on top of the recon-ditioned subgrade.  The final surface will be a three-layer bituminous surface treatment (BST) consisting of clean, durable crushed rock and CRS2 emulsified asphalt.  Clean, high quality crushed rock is critical to this project and materials testing will be required as a part of this contract. 

Road generated sediment will be reduced and the expected life of the BST extended by improving the existing drainage features.  The existing ditches and culvert catch basins will be improved, new culverts and culvert inlet headwalls will be added to the drainage system, and an existing 42 inch dia culvert will be replaced with an 81 inch x 59 inch steel arch culvert.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 5419   The U.S. EPA Air Pollution Prevention & Control Division (APPCD) requires a procurement on a sole source basis to Dr. Mort Barlaz from N.C. State University for a project concerning landfill gas as a potential pathway for the release of chemical and/or biological contaminants.  This requirement will include a literature review that summarizes published data on the fate and transport of selected chemical and biological agents as applicable to landfills.  Conduct of bounding calculations using equilibrium assumptions that provide estimates of the behavior of  selected chemical agents in landfills, and the design of laboratory-scale experiments which will validate the bounding calculations will also be involved.  EPA source research indicates that Dr. Mort Barlaz (N.C. State Univ.) is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement due to pre-existing  equipment (laboratory-scale reactors) and the expertise available thru NCSU.  NSCU has expertise that is internationally recognized for evaluating the decomposition of biodegradable wastes in a landfill.  Dr. Barlaz has over 200 peer-reviewed journal publications in this research topic.  This is  not a request for quotation.  However, any individual/firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit a technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the requirements.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting  of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or  to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is October 31, 2003.

By the Second World War, there were 10 mining companies working to mine and produce lead, zinc, silver, antimony, mercury, gold, tungsten and arsenic.  After the Second World War, four uranium mines were added, along with commercial production of rare-earth metals, molybdenum, rhenium, gold and fluorspar.  During the Soviet era, more than 50,000 persons worked in the mining sector in Kyrgyzstan.

The development of gold deposits has been the recent focus of attention for foreign investment in Kyrgyzstan, and is seen as having the best potential for development of the mining sector.  The country has the benefit of extensive geological exploration work conducted during Soviet times.  This resulted in the discovery and detailed identification of over 90 gold deposits in the country.  The detailed data on these deposits is on file at SAGMR. 

Presently, the large Kumtor mine accounts for almost all of the gold production of the country.  In 1993, a joint venture was established between Kyrgyzaltyn, the state-owned mining company, and the Cameco Company of Canada to develop the Kumtor gold deposit, which has reserves reported to be in excess of 200 tons.  The Kumtor project had a capital cost of $452 million and was financed by a syndicate of bank loans led by J.P. Morgan Chase.  Presently, Kumtor produces 23.5 tons of gold annually.  

However, Kyrgyzstan has approximately 90 discovered but undeveloped small to medium-sized gold deposits.  These deposits are fairly well documented, due to the extensive exploration work that was done during the Soviet era.  Many of these deposits were extensively explored, with geological data on file at the offices of the SAGMR.  This previous work has the effect of reducing some of the geological risk associated with developing gold projects.  Some of these deposits are under license, but the vast majority are not.

While these deposits may not be attractive to large mining companies, they may be attractive to smaller mining companies looking to increase gold reserves and company assets in a relatively short period of time.  The TA would identify and analyze the most promising small to medium sized gold deposits not already under license.  A list of 5 to 10 prospects for promotion to gold mining companies in the U.S. would be created.  Estimations of the reserves for these deposits would be prepared in conformance with international standards.  Preliminary economic models, including scenarios based on proposed changes to the mining and tax law, would be created for the selected deposits.  A brochure containing this information on each selected deposit would be created for promotion to prospective small to mid-sized U.S. gold mining companies.   Relevant Kyrgyz officials would then be brought to the U.S. to make presentations of the deposits at a mining conference.

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this TA will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $290,000 grant to the SAGMR from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.

Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Infrared Narrow Band Optical Filter, number 1-LAH-23952 which was posted on 9/3/2003.  This modification is to answer questions received as follows: 1). What are your blocking requirements? It states TBD but we need this information to finalize the substrate and coatings. Out of band blocking:  maximum transmission to be less than 0.1% from UV to 16 microns.  We would like blocking of far IR also, but we plan to use other filters for that if necessary. 2). How this would you require the substrate if we use Ge? The above is consistent with a Ge substrate. 3). What wedge is required for a Ge substrate? Wedging is not required if an anti-reflection coating on the rear surface of the filter sufficiently reduces channeling effects.    Our spectral resolution will be 0.07 cm-1 so channeling fringe spacing should be much less than this (~0.1 cm-1) OR the fringe contrast should be less than 10% in the band pass region.  A wedged filter substrate producing fringe spacings of 0.1 cm-1 or less is acceptable.  Also acceptable is a filter with an anti-reflection coating which produces a peak-to-valley  variations in filter fringe amplitude less than or equal to 10% of the signal transmitted by the filter in the band pass region.  4). What are your surface quality requirements? &lt;0.5 wave pre-coated substrate flatness (peak to peak) The due date for responses IS extended through 10/8/2003. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet and are in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

8. POSITION DESCRIPTION:

I. Direct Supervisor:

Director or designee, USAID/Armenia Program Office, who provides both general guidance and specific assignments to the Supervisory Public Information Officer.

II. Supervisory Controls:

The incumbent will have a broad development background and USAID experience; therefore, he/she will independently carry out the functions of this position, based on general procedural guidelines and strategic/policy direction from his/her supervisor.

III.  Introduction:

Armenia is a small, landlocked, mountainous country with few natural resources.  About the size of Maryland (29,800 square kilometers), it is situated in the Caucasus Region, surrounded by Georgia, Azerbaijan, Iran and Turkey.  In September 1991, Armenian voters opted for independence from the Soviet Union.  However, the break-up of the Soviet Union brought an end to the commercial ties and protected markets which had helped make Armenia among the most prosperous of the former Soviet republics. 

Armenia’s early years of independence were characterized by severe economic decline and energy shortages.  This situation precipitated a new humanitarian crisis, while the country was still recovering from the economic and social fallout of the 1988 earthquake, which had left over 25,000 people dead and 500,000 homeless.  To a large extent, the crises that Armenia experienced during the early- to mid-1990’s have abated.  However, political and economic institutions and practices are nascent and progress towards structural reform has been inconsistent.  While there has been positive economic growth in recent years, Armenia has yet to recover to its pre-independence income levels.  Armenia’s internal political landscape remains unstable, and its relations with its neighbors remain problematic.  Finally, there is not an adequate social safety net to meet the basic needs of country’s vulnerable groups, including those who have been negatively impacted by Armenia’s transition process.       

Notwithstanding the above mentioned conditions, since its independence Armenia has emerged as a strategically important republic in the Caucasus, whose progress towards a democratic political order and free market economy is critical to U.S. interests in the region.  Since 1998, USAID has shifted its program emphasis from humanitarian to a longer-term developmental approach to facilitate Armenia’s transition to a free market democracy.  Currently, the Mission has strategic objectives in the following four principal areas: private sector growth, energy sector, democracy/governance and social sectors.  In these areas, the Mission is carrying out an ambitious program that balances the needs for macro-level reform and sustainability with the immediate demands to improve the quality of life of the Armenian populace.  In addition, the Mission has two special objectives—one that addresses water management issues, and another includes regional and politically driven initiatives (e.g., earmark for assistance in the earthquake zone).

Since 1994, USAID/Armenia’s funding has averaged $67 million annually.  In FY 2002, the Mission expects a program budget of approximately $55 million with more that 50 ongoing and new activities. These figures establish Armenia as one of the largest per capita recipients of U.S. assistance in the world.  High political interest by the US Congress, an active and vocal US Diaspora community and an active in country Armenian NGO community make it imperative that results of USAID's program and its successes are widely disseminated. The incumbent's key function will be to manage the flow of information to important USAID stakeholders.  

IV.  DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The incumbent will serve as the Supervisory Public Information Officer (SPIO) in USAID/Armenia’s Program Office.  In this capacity, the SPIO will:

1.	      40% - Supervise/Info Strategy/Program knowledge and coordination/PR materials

Supervise and be actively involved in the development and implementation of a Mission information strategy.

The information strategy will reflect the objectives of USAID assistance, integrate information availability into activity planning and execution, and explain how information will be used to show the impact of USAID assistance on the transformation process in Armenia.  The Mission’s information strategy will include mechanisms that encourage alliances with Diaspora organizations.

Maintain knowledge of the inter-relationships and significance of various program components in the process of economic, democratic and social transition in Armenia.  Utilize this knowledge to improve coordination of activities within USAID/Armenia and with other USG agencies.  Advise internal and external stakeholders on aspects of the Mission’s program.

Oversee the development and maintenance of programmatic public relations materials in two languages – English and Armenian – including brochures, Activity Fact Sheets, periodic news letters, video documentaries, visual displays, internet site, etc.  Oversee responses to project proposals and requests for information on USAID/Armenia projects from Armenian Diaspora Organizations in the U.S. and Europe.

Coordinate with Mission staff to develop, organize and maintain updated hard and electronic versions of briefing materials, including background papers, success stories and  presentations of USAID/Armenia projects.  Edit these documents into uniform, succinct and readable briefing books for presentation to high-level U.S. delegations.

2.	      25% - Media / PD

Serve as principal contact for local and international press and media. For USAID-Government of Armenia meetings, lead advance team to negotiate protocol issues with staff of participating government officials, establish event schedules, ascertain staging requirements, etc.  

Coordinate with the Mission Director, Activity Mangers, and the Public Diplomacy (PD) section of the Embassy to promote press and media coverage of Mission activities.

<DESC>This is a modification to the Notice of Intent to modify Contract No. 263-C-00-01-00007-00 under which Montgomery Watson Harza Americas, Inc. (MWH) provides Engineering and Construction Management Consultant (E&CMC) services to Middle Egypt Utilities Project using the Other than Full and Open Competition procedures allowed under USAID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR) Subpart 706.302-70 (b) 5 (?An award for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the government or would result in unacceptable delays). There will be no solicitation documents issued for the proposed action. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the government will consider all expressions of interest received within thirty days (30) after date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. USAID Contract Number 263-C-00-01-0007-00 with Montgomery Watson Harza Americas, Inc. (MWH) was executed on February 13, 2001 in the amount of $15,632,528 and expires on September 29, 2004.  MWH is now providing CMC services for the current host country Design/Build contract between ABB Susa, Inc. and Minia Economic General Authority for Water and Sanitation (MEGAWS).

During the period covered by the proposed CMC contract modification (subject of this Notice).

Then, the Design/Build contractor shall conduct an Advise & Assist period for six months ending September 29, 2005. The purpose of the contract modification is to extend the MWH current contract for a period of one year from September 29, 2004 to September 29, 2005, to provide a small staff that would provide oversight, to complete punch list work of the Design/Build construction contractor, the commissioning phase and the Advise & Assistance period.  All construction work under the Design/Build Contract, valued at $100,301,000 and LE 21,000,000 (Egyptian Pounds) will be completed prior to the proposed CMC contract modification, thereby reducing required CMC services to a minimal level of effort.

Pumping Stations/ Force Main Fayoum City Improvements Program 3. Beni Suef City US Water Treatment Beni Suef City Plant (WTP) Expansion 4. Beni Suef City WWTP Beni Suef City Replacement 5.

<DESC>This is notice that WR-ALC anticipates issuing a contract to Northrop Grumman, Baltimore, MD for the acquisition of spare parts and repairs for items that are determined to be sole source to Northrop Grumman.  The initial award will focus on items within FSC 5895.  Other sole source items outside of FSC 5895 will be included throughout the life of the contract.  A fixed price type contract is contemplated for a total of ten years.  An award fee clause based on delivery performance may be included.   

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the
purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application. The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation. To request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or  call DLSC at the above number. The solicitation/data package will be mailed to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time it is initially issued. Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).  

Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.


Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
Ref No. 011703, C-Architect and Engineering Services, 
Multi-Discipline, Open-End Contract

1.  Question:  The RFP limits the number of pages for the SF254 to 15.  Is this number per SF254 or the total of all SF254's submitted?  In the past for Eglin solicitations we have submitted a SF254 for us as prime and for all of the consultants (subcontractors) who will be on our team.  

Answer:  15 pages per SF 254.

2.  Question:  I was wondering if the 15 page limit for the 255 was for the entire document, including project references and resumes (Blocks 7 and 8) or just the Block 10.  Would you please clarify?

Answer:  The limit of 15 pages is for the entire SF 255.

3.  Question:  In the past one SF255 has been submitted for the entire team.  Please confirm that this is the requirement for this submittal and that Engineering/Contracting are not requiring a SF255 for each team member.

Answer:  One SF255 per team.

4.  Question:  The synopsis is clear for number of pages - 15 for 254 and 15 for 255 (total for both forms would be 30 pgs).  My question is that since this is an indefinite quantity contract, do 254's and 255's for subcontractors have to be submitted now, or only the 254 and 255 for the firm who will be the prime?  Since it is indefinite quantity for 5 years, other subs may be used and by submitting now, submitting for subs will limit the use of subs that may come up in the next 5 years.

Answer:  We need these for each sub.

<DESC>In response to solicitation number SP0200-01-R-5011,DSCP intends to award Firm Fixed Price (with Economic Price Adjustment [EPA]) Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery type contract(s) for the supply of laboratory items.  Any resultant contract will contain a base period plus four one-year option periods for a total of 60 months.

A brief description of the program follows:  DSCP intends to provide our customers with a viable commercial-based delivery program for laboratory supplies.  The purpose is to maintain an industry standard "Just-In-Time" (JIT) inventory approach for any or all laboratory ware/supplies.  The objective of the LIDS is to develop "Total Catalog/Total Delivered Price" ordering, payment and administration of lab ware and lab supplies.  The program will provide DoD customers total access to product in peacetime and mobilization, improve the industry's ability to provide nearly all products under one contracting arrangement and significantly improve industry's ability to respond quickly to a wide range and type of military mobilization and deployments.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SYNOPSIS TO ADVERTISE A SOLICITATION THAT IS READY FOR RELEASE, rather the purposes are (a) to determine whether there are a sufficient number of responsible sources and (b) to conduct market research.  The US Coast Guard is seeking ways to covertly mark a target craft to increase its detection range for later relocation.  Most commonly, targets would be marked by aircraft (fixed wing or helicopter) with limited fuel capacity and no means to conduct a boarding.  Target relocation would be done by surface vessels, but sometimes from aircraft, and may need to be done at night.  Marker systems must be non-toxic, eye-safe and difficult for personnel aboard the target craft to detect, cover up, or remove.  Preferred candidates include particles or dyes that are invisible to the naked eye, but are detectable by radar or near-to-mid wavelength IR sensors.  Ideally they should be self-luminescing (for 4-12+ hours), or detectable under ambient night time conditions.  (Artificial illumination using a tuned spotlight or eye-safe laser may be considered, but is not preferred due to range and sweep width limitations).  Companies or subject matter experts having existing systems or proposing systems requiring limited development with any of these capabilities are encouraged to submit responses to this announcement.  Please describe succinctly any marking dyes or compounds that meet these requirements.  If artificial illumination is required, describe the proposed light sources.  Include cost information for commercially available systems, or estimate development costs.  
The sole purpose of this announcement is to identify existing products or systems with the described capabilities.  Offerors shall provide the following: 1. Capability Statement addressing the above areas (limit 3 pages).  2. Company history and contact information (limit 1 page).  This announcement is not a research or development project.  The purpose of this announcement is NOT to “develop” or evaluate potential new products, services or facilities, or to improve existing facilities for the purpose of meeting the specific performance capabilities or objectives.  At this stage, the Government has no intention to further develop or produce any equipment from the information received.  Information collected through this announcement will be reviewed by individuals from the USCG.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 325998.  All responses are required by November 2, 2003.  Responses may be forwarded electronically to Joyce P. Overton, Contract Specialist, Phone 860-441-2886, Fax 860-441-2888, Email joverton@rdc.uscg.mil. Electronic responses are preferred, but company brochures or product sheets are also acceptable.  Technical questions may be addressed to Mr. Robert Sedat, Phone 860-441-2684 or Email rsedat@rdc.uscg.mil.  Please identify if you are large or small business in your response.  NOTE:  Actual proposals are not being solicited at this time for the above requirement, and no contract will be awarded in response to this "Sources Sought" and "Market Research Synopsis".

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is conducting a market survey to determine if there are organizations or businesses with an interest in obtaining the contents of the two Cord Blood Banks (CBBs) funded as part of the Cord Blood Transplantation Study (COBLT).  The COBLT banking program was initiated in 1996 with support from NHLBI and conducted under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted Investigational New Drug (IND) application.  The overall goals of the program were to 1)develop standard operating procedures for the collection, testing, processing, cryopreservation, and thawing of unrelated donor umbilical cord blood and 2)build ethnically diverse CBBs to support a stem cell transplantation research protocol.  The program included three banks, multiple collection centers, a CBB committee, and a coordinating center.  Currently, the contents of the banks are located at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, and the University of California at Los Angeles, California. 
Contents of the banks include over 8,000 well characterized, inventoried, Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typed, cryopreserved umbilical cord blood units; electronic data bases with a unit inventory and HLA typing information; frozen plasma, red cell/granulocyte, and viable cell samples for each cord blood unit; and electronic and paper files with screening and characterization data.   The cord blood units were collected from December 1997 through June 2000 using standardized procedures.  The data for each unit has been double reviewed at the COBLT CBB and confirmed by a computer algorithm as eligible for use as a stem cell source on the COBLT transplant protocol.  Units are stored in liquid nitrogen freezers (Standard and Thermogenesis BioArchive) in 25 mL bags.   Red cell/granulocyte and plasma samples are stored frozen in mechanical freezers.  Full details of the collection, processing, cryopreservation, screening, and characterization of the units can be found in the COBLT CBB Standard Operating Procedures at http://www.emmes.com .  All laboratory equipment necessary to maintain this valuable resource will be included.   PLEASE NOTE: No funds to maintain and run a cord blood bank program will be provided.  Interested parties should submit a capability statement describing their ability to:
•	Manage and maintain a cord blood bank program
•	Provide adequate facilities and staff to run a cord blood banking program
•	Comply with federal and other regulations regarding licensure, need for IND, annual reports, confidentiality 
•	Make the units available to potential transplant recipients through an established stem cell search registry
•	Abide by the terms of the original donor informed consent 
•	Ensure that transplant outcome data is sent to an established registry program
In addition, a fee may be charged to cord blood unit recipients by the cord blood bank.  The fee for non-licensed use should be estimated using the cost to replace the unit in the bank inventory.  The fee for licensed use may be based on the market value.  The capability statement should include an estimate and description of fees the bank would use.
The capability statement must be submitted on or before November 4, 2003 and must reference number NHLBI-HB-04-24.  Seven (7) copies of your capability statement should be delivered to Lynda Bindseil, Contracting Officer, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 6134, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Licensing Opportunity for Unique Microfluidic Capillary Fittings, Manifolds and Interconnects
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is actively soliciting industry partners to license, manufacture, and sell a unique suite of microfluidic connection products.  We are offering two distinct portfolios: The CapTite™ collection of capillary fittings, which is based on our exclusive one-piece ferrule; and the Chip-Tite™ series of manifolds and interconnects, which is fully compatible with CapTite™. Specifications for both collections can be viewed at http://www.ca.sandia.gov/industry_partner/MicroChem.html ).  

Because microfluidic and lab-on-a-chip products are expected to provide superior benefits in many important and growing markets, we believe these fittings and manifolds will find broad application in the existing research community as well as in many emerging markets.  Current applications include proteomics, genomics, HPLC, micro-mechanical and micro-hydraulic assemblies.  Experts predict that the microfluidics industry is also likely to benefit from the technological progress in complementary areas such as semiconductors and health care, and from enhanced funding through government grants and direct sales. Lab-on-a-chip devices are expected to eventually provide multiplexing and lower overall price for research, routine, and diagnostic testing. This offering represents an opportunity to license a product line with the potential to become the standard for microfluidic devices that will permeate the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, life science, defense, public health and food and agriculture markets.

If your company has the technical capability and manufacturing capacity to produce these devices for government and commercial applications, and if you wish to pursue this unique opportunity, please email a brief description of your company, your contact information, and your interests in this venture to: Partnerships-CA@sandia.gov. You will be contacted by a licensing representative who will discuss the requirements and steps for procuring a license.  

Please respond no later than October 31, 2003

Should you desire additional information please refer to our website: http://www.ca.sandia.gov/industry_partner/MicroChem.html ).

1. Vision
The purpose of this requirement is to obtain tool procurement, control, and accountability services in support of the Ogden Air Logistics Center’s (ALC) mission to provide depot repair, modification and maintenance for the F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft, A-10 Thunderbolt aircraft, C-130 Hercules aircraft, and the ICBM Peacekeeper and Minuteman missile.  The center also overhauls and repairs Landing Gear/Wheels and Brakes for Air Force aircraft; Rocket Motors; Air Munitions and Guided Bombs; Photonics Equipment; Training Devices; Electronics; Avionics; Instruments; Hydraulics; Power Systems; Software; and other Aerospace related components.  This endeavor will provide the ALC an avenue to buy and use tools and prevent foreign object damage to aircraft, engines, missiles, training and support equipment, and to reduce operating costs through effective tool control and accountability.  This service will initially be provided and sustained in targeted maintenance areas, then potentially expanded throughout the Maintenance Directorate.  
2.  Scope

The Statement of Objectives reflects current government objectives and business practices, allowing contractors to propose and price a solution to known requirements.  It is anticipated that specific tool procurement, control, and accountability services and outlined objectives will evolve over the life cycle of this order.

<SUBJECT>54 -- Follow Up - FPI to Offer Portable Housing Units/Disaster Relief Shelters
<DESC>On July 18, 2003, FPI published an announcement in the Federal Business Opportunities regarding FPI’s intent to produce portable housing units/disaster relief shelters for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on a non-mandatory basis.  Portable housing units/disaster relief shelters encompass all items in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 5411 - Rigid Wall Shelters.  The  July 18th notice explained that this product is a new requirement for FEMA.  FEMA approached FPI only after failing to identify any commercially available offerings which met all of the agency's needs.  A preliminary analysis by FPI reveals the manufacturing process for this product will be labor-intensive, which will result in more than 20 percent of the finished product's value being added by FPI. In the manufacturing of this product, FPI will purchase all necessary materials and components from private sector suppliers. In this effort, FPI will look first to vendors currently listed on General Services Administration (GSA) schedules, and will make every effort to utilize small business suppliers.  Pursuant to this proposal, once this product is sold as a non-mandatory item by FPI, it will never be added to FPI's Schedule of Products as a mandatory source product.  The July 18th notice stated that FPI will not attempt to exercise its mandatory source at some future point in time for portable housing units/disaster relief shelters, nor will it seek approval from its Board of Directors to expand production by invoking the guidelines process at some later date.  FPI's Board of Directors has determined that whatever share of the market FPI acquires on a non-mandatory basis will be deemed to be a reasonable share of the market within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 4122(b)(2).  Sales of portable housing units/disaster relief shelters will be tracked and recorded separately by FPI.  FPI has received comments in reference to the July 18th notice however, they were from prospective partners interested in doing business with FPI.  None of the comments received expressed opposition to FPI manufacturing portable housing units/disaster relief shelters for FEMA.   Any interested party has a right to raise any question at any time with FPI’s Board of Directors.  All written correspondence should be addressed to: Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation and Corporate Support Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.  Attention: FPI Board of Directors.

Statement of Work

Child Care Tuition Assistance Plan Administration

Background

The Agency is soliciting proposals from qualified organizations to administer the Agency=s child care tuition assistance program.  Enacted November 12, 2001, Section 630 of Public Law 107-67 authorizes the use of appropriated funds by executive agencies to provide child care services for Federal civilian employees.
