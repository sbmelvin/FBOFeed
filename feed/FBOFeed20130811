<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued in conjunction with FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, as applicable. The solicitation number is FDA-13-223-1119987. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) FAC 2005-69, dated August 1, 2013.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is - 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 in number of employees. The solicitation is set-aside 100% for small businesses.</p>
<p>The US Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) intends to issue a Commercial Item UFirm Fixed-PriceU purchase order that meets the following specifications below.</p>
<p>SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES/COSTS</p>
<p>CLIN Item Description Qty U/I Unit Price Extended Price<br />0001 &bull; Broad (Low)-Energy Gamma Ray Spectrometer System 1 Ea <br />TOTAL (to include any delivery, shipping, and/or installation charges)</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Gamma ray spectrometry is one of the most important radioanalytical techniques used by the FDA Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA), Winchester Engineering and Analytical (WEAC), in support of Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) radiological emergency response. For screening and confirmatory analysis of radionuclides in foods in a nuclear event, especially, in an event where radioactive contamination source is unknown, the gamma-ray spectrometer is also a radio-analytical laboratory's first choice for screening radionuclides in samples. During Chernobyl and Three Mile Island incidents, thousands of samples were sent to WEAC within a month for radionuclides analysis and gamma-ray spectrometers played crucial roles in screening, analysis, and decision making in whether further analysis of other type (alpha or beta) of radioisotopes is needed. The recent catastrophe in Japan justified again the gamma-ray spectrometer's importance in a radiological emergency response--the nation's food safety and food defense against radionuclides contamination. WEAC's routine radiological programs and programs derived from WEAC's radiological emergency responsibility are essential part of the nation's food safety and defense against radionuclides contamination in foods. To ensure WEAC's capability of executing the FDA's radionuclides program, the requested system is required to expand WEAC's gamma-ray analysis capacity and enhance WEAC's capability of analyzing certain radionuclides.</p>
<p>Salient Characteristics:</p>
<p>1. The spectrometer system shall interface with the current gamma analysis software used at WEAC (WEAC's gamma-ray spectrometer systems are operated with APEX software in conjunction with Genie 2K). <br />2. Energy range from 3keV to 3MeV.<br />3. Optimized detector efficiency in the 3keV to 662keV energy region.<br />4. Thin, stable entrance window to minimize low energy efficiency loss (e.g. 0.6 mm Carbon Composite window).<br />5. Full Width Half Max (FWHM) (i.e. resolution) of approximately 0.5keV at 5.9keV; 0.75keV at 122keV; and 2.2keV at 1332keV.<br />6. The Detector system shall be configured with geometry modeling, efficiency modeling, and calibration characterization.<br />7. A Preamplifier with 3 meter bias, high voltage inhibit, and signal and power cables.<br />8. Vertical Slimline dipstick cryostat (allows cooling of the detector via "cold finger").<br />9. The system shall have a liquid nitrogen recycling system for detector cooling. <br />10. Electronics Interface (Multi-channel analyzer) manufactured for signal processing and communication with software. <br />11. The system shall have a cable set necessary to connect the detector preamp with the multi-channel analyzer (preferably at least 10 ft in length).<br />Place of Performance:</p>
<p>The delivery address will be: HHS/FDA/ORA/WEAC, 109 Holton St., Winchester, MA 01890.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:</p>
<p>Thirty (30) days after contract award.</p>

A Seller's failure to comply with these terms may result in its Bid being determined to be non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Award will be made to the responsible contractor (see FAR Part 9) whose quote or offer meets the lowest price/technically acceptable. In accordance with FAR Subpart 13.106-1, the Government will consider the following for award: Price, Warranty conditions. Evaluation will be in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.106-2.  The Government intends to evaluate quotes and make award without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial quote should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price standpoint. Do not assume you will have the opportunity to clarify, discuss or revise your offer. Offerors may, at the discretion of the Government, be asked to provide more information and clarification regarding their offer/quote. Request for such information does not constitute discussions. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government intends to make a single, Firm-Fixed Price award. <BR> <BR>Offer evaluation will be in accordance with: FAR Sub-Part 15.101-2 -- Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection Process (a) The lowest price technically acceptable source selection process is appropriate when best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. (b) When using the lowest price technically acceptable process, the following apply: (1) The evaluation factors and significant subfactors that establish the requirements of acceptability shall be set forth in the solicitation. Solicitations shall specify that award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. If the contracting officer documents the file pursuant to 15.304(c)(3)(iii), past performance need not be an evaluation factor in lowest price technically acceptable source selections. If the contracting officer elects to consider past performance as an evaluation factor, it shall be evaluated in accordance with 15.305. However, the comparative assessment in 15.305(a)(2)(i) does not apply. If the contracting officer determines that a small business? past performance is not acceptable, the matter shall be referred to the Small Business Administration for a Certificate of Competency determination, in accordance with the procedures contained in subpart 19.6 and 15 U.S.C. 637(b)(7)).

Requirement). Failure to provide any required documents prior to the proposal due date and time will deem your offer non-responsive and ineligible for award. <BR> <BR>Sellers understand that FedBid ranks all Bids by price; however, pursuant to applicable acquisition regulations and/or departmental guidelines, Buyers may use criteria other than price to evaluate offers. Accordingly, please note that, unless otherwise specified in the Buy Terms, below, to the extent required by applicable regulations and/or guidelines, award will be made to the responsible Seller whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Buyer on the basis of price, technical capability, delivery, and past performance. <BR> <BR>The Buy American Act?
