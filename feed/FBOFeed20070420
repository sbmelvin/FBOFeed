<DESC>Architect-Engineer or Engineering Services are required primarily for Virginia, North Carolina, and West Virginia, but shall include other various activities within the Geographic area of responsibility of Naval Facilities Engineering Command Atlantic, including the Continental United States, the Caribbean, Africa and Europe.  The primary purpose is to conduct subsurface investigations with subsequent geotechnical/foundation analysis - including monitoring, sampling and analysis of soil and groundwater for geotechnical properties and environmental contamination using various field and laboratory tests.  The contractor must be capable of providing design services when required.  The design will typically be for foundation of structures or airfield pavement but may consist of any design discipline or system this Command provides.  Also included is the testing and evaluation of subsurface, construction and building materials for contract compliance.  Construction or Materials testing laboratories performing work under this contract must be accredited by one of the laboratory accreditation authorities.  The laboratorys accreditation shall include the ASTM standards as appropriate to the tests listed in this contract.  This policy applies to the specific laboratory performing the actual testing, not just the Corporate Office.  Submit to Code CIGE a copy of the Certificate of Accreditation and Scope of Accreditation.  The scope of the laboratorys accreditation shall include the test methods employed within the Contract.  For testing laboratories that have not yet obtained certification by an acceptable Laboratory Accreditation Authority listed below, submit an acknowledgement letter within 30 days after award of this contract from one of the Laboratory Accreditation Authorities indicating that the application for accreditation has been received and the accreditation process has started.

Laboratory Accreditation Authorities

	National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program  (NVLAP)
Administered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
	The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Program
	ICBO Evaluation Service, Inc. (ICBO ES)
	The American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) Program
	The Army Corps of Engineers
	Washington Area Council of Engineering Laboratories (WACEL) 
Approval authority by WACEL is limited to projects within the FEC Ches  geographical area 


Field investigation typically will require mobilization to locations using transportation not provided by the U. S. Government, arranging for required security clearance to obtain base access for all drillers and equipment, field location of utilities with appropriate equipment, and locating and performing borings.  Provide GPS (Lat/Long) coordinates for boring locations and landmarks  accurate to 3 meters or better.  Mobilization charge includes personnel for boring layout, charges for scoping for utilities and coordination with the local point(s) of contact  including necessary clearances and permission for access.  Provide 24-hour groundwater data in a minimum of three representative locations.  If the drilling method does not allow direct reading from the borehole, a temporary well must be installed.
2.	Incidental monitoring requiring sampling and analysis of soil and groundwater for environmental contamination shall include, but not be limited to, providing capability to monitor boreholes for combustible gas or petroleum vapors at sites of potentially contaminated soil material and/or groundwater, and providing labor, equipment and protection measures (EPA Levels C and D) for performing subsurface investigations.  Services shall also include providing soils and environmental personnel (technical and professional) at field and laboratory locations to perform or evaluate subsurface investigation, testing or inspection for subsequent construction design.  A typical report will include a description of the drilling method used and any pertinent site observations along with the boring location plan, the boring logs and tabulated laboratory test results with typical graphical backup.  Services may include a more extensive written report containing a discussion of sampling procedures and site conditions influencing investigation/testing/project design, project recommendations based upon interpretation of test results and the results of investigation/testing performed.  One electronic and 1 hard copy of each report will be provided.  The electronic copy shall be provided on CD in an AUTOCAD compatible format (either .DFX or .DWG).  Provide a book marked Adobe acrobat file of the geotechnical report on CD. The text of the report shall be in text-selectable format, i.e. not in scanned raster format.  Also provide one hard copy of the report.  Boring logs and notes, a summary of lab test results, and groundwater observations shall be prepared on a NAVFACLANT D-size sheet in accordance with current LANT AutoCAD standards.  Code CIGE will provide a current D-size sheet drawform template.  Forwarding of the boring log sheet to the Government indicates that the drafted logs have been checked by a Professional Engineer of the drilling firm for completeness, accuracy and conformity to LANT drafting standards.  The completed D-size .dwg file shall be forwarded to LANT Code CIGE by e-mail as soon as it is available with the CD and hard copies mailed soon thereafter.
3.	The A&E must demonstrate his and each key consultant's qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors for all services.  Evaluation factors (1) through (5) are of equal importance; factor (6) is of lesser importance and will be used as a tie-breaker among technically equal firms.  Specific evaluation factors include:  (1) Specialized Experience - Firms will be evaluated in terms of:  (a) their past experience with regard to geotechnical and environmental investigations, testing and analysis; and (b) knowledge of local codes, laws, permits and construction materials and practices in the contract area (greater weight will be given to the States of Virginia, North Carolina and West Virginia); (2) Professional qualifications and technical competence in the type of work required:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of the design staff's:  (a) active professional registration; (b) experience (with present and other firms) and specific roles of staff members  on projects addressed in evaluation factor number one; (c) capability to provide qualified backup staffing for key personnel to ensure continuity of services and surge ability to meet unexpected project demands; and (d) organization and office management as evidenced by management approach (management plan for this contract) and personnel roles in organization.  Individual and joint venture qualifications should be identified with particular emphasis on credentials of the firms proposed point of contact for the Government requested services.  Indicate the office location where the point of contact will be located and where the office and laboratory work will be performed.  Identify professional qualifications and experience of the geotechnical and environmental professionals that will perform analysis and prepare reports.  Identify in-house and consultants capabilities for providing environmental monitoring, sampling, material testing, soil borings and foundation analysis.  Identify any known limitations for staff obtaining security clearances required for access to Government installations.  Identify ability of the firm to mobilize to the location of required services (both primary and total contract area, including response capabilities of the firm to provide air or ship transportation), to provide location (scoping) for underground utilities prior to drilling, and to obtain supplies required for boring and monitoring well installation at remote locations of work; (3) Ability to perform the majority of the work within the firms permanent staff as required by FAR 52.219-14(b)(1), ability to perform the firms projected workload during the anticipated contract period and the firms history of successfully completing projects in compliance with performance schedules in general.  Provide specific experience and related timeframes to accomplish similar services.  Typically soil boring projects are required to be completed within 28 days of issuance of the work order.  Identify ability to complete an emergency work order of $20,000 or less within 10 working days and the ability to complete 4 work orders issued within a 10 day period.  If joint venture consultants are involved, address history of working relationships; (4) Past performance - Firms will be evaluated in terms of:  (a) past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of type of work, quality of work, compliance with performance schedules; and (b) demonstrated long-term business relationships and repeat business with Government and private customers, and performance awards/letters of recommendations received; (5) Quality Control Program - Firms will be evaluated on the acceptability of their internal quality control program used to ensure a technically accurate product; (6) Volume of Work - Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by DOD with the objective of affecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.
4.	The contract requires that the selected firm have an on-line access to E-mail via the internet for routine exchange of correspondence, and have Central Contractor Registration.  The duration of the contract will be for one (1) year from the date of an initial contract award.  The proposed contract includes four (4) one (1) year Government options for the same basic professional skills.  The total A&E fee that may be paid under this contract will not exceed $1,000,000.  No other general notification to firms for other similar projects performed under this contract will be made.  Type of contract:  Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Quantity Contract.

The contractor shall supply all materials for this project except the ECS system, urea dosing system(s), oil injection system, lube oil, NOx sensors, exhaust burner, and any required LabView code.  Coding will also be required for urea dosing and exhaust burner control if it is to be controlled by the test site computer. The initial test shall be for 500 hours. The specifics of the test are as follows:  (1) Test Engine:  A Cummins ISX non-EGR equipped engine provided shall be provided by the contractor (4 gram engine out NOx);  (2) Test ECS Hardware:  The test is run using a dual-flow path system.  Exhaust system inlet and outlet cones, catalysts, NOx sensors, urea injector, lube oil injector and system control drivers will be provided by EPA.  Appropriate National Instruments hardware shall be provided by the contractor.  All exhaust tubing entering and exiting the ECS shall be 4? in diameter.  The contractor shall be expected to provide all emission control system monitoring components including dP sensors and thermocouples of a type specified by EPA.  The contractor shall also be expected to integrate the ECS into their existing test cell set up;   (3) Test Fuel and Oil Specifications:  The testing is to be performed using diesel fuel with a nominal sulfur concentration of 10 ppm.  Engine lube oil shall be of a low SAP type.  Lube oil will be provided by EPA.  32.5% urea in water solution shall be provided by the contractor.  Urea solution may be purchased from NALCO Corporation, Naperville, IL, (248) 344-7564;   (4) Urea, Lube Oil, and Fuel Consumption Rates:  Urea consumption shall be about 4% of fuel consumption.  EPA will provide lube oil.  To accelerate aging, lube oil will be injected into the intake manifold of the engine at a rate of approximately 0.5% of fuel consumption.  EPA would like this injection to be controlled by or integrated into the contractor?s test cell controller.  Engine fuel consumption rate shall be determined by the contractor.  A burner will be incorporated into the exhaust system to generate exhaust temperatures of up to 700?C.  The fuel consumption of the burner shall be taken into consideration.  The contractor shall install the burner and oil injection system;   (5)  Aging Mode: AVL Mode 8 (for the ISX, about 1800 rpm and 90% throttle).  This is equivalent to locomotive Notch 8.  Approximate exhaust temperature will be 430?C;  (6)  Emissions: Emissions check of regulated pollutants is not required.  All NOx measurement will be performed using ZrO2 NOx sensors provided by EPA;  (7)  Test Data Requirement:  All applicable data channels will be recorded.  Data shall be made available daily to the EPA via the internet;  (8) Test Goals:  The overall goal of the test shall be to maintain a NOx reduction efficiency of > 80% throughout the test.   This testing also includes three (3) options for additional testing.  Option 1:  Run a second engine in parallel with and in the same configuration as the engine described above.  This will require a second test site and engine and would be used to age a second pair of emission control systems;  Option 2:  Maximum of 30 additional 100-hour increments (3000 hours total) of locomotive emission control system aging as set forth above;  Option 3 Maximum of 8 test cell down times of one week each for removal of catalysts for evaluation by EPA away from the contractor?s site. The contractor shall provide a final report by August 31, 2007 giving an overview of the testing performed.  Also the contractor shall perform daily monitoring of the engine and ECS to insure that the system is operating properly.  Detailed logs of test hours, issues, and resolutions will be kept in a computer file that can be sent to the EPA at any time during the course of the test at EPA?s request. This procurement is a small business set-aside under NAICS code 811198 with a size standard of $6.5 million.  Award will be made using ?Best Value? evaluation criteria.  All responsible sources capable of providing the required Accelerated Aging Testing of a Locomotive Emission Control System may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the Agency.  The solicitation will be posted on the Fedbizopps.gov website by May 8, 2007.  Questions should be submitted in writing to Scott Tharp via Fax (513) 487-2107 or email Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.

<DESC>THE ABOVE ADDRESS IS INCORRECT.  Please use the following address for any correspondence:  Office of Acquisitions, OLAO, NIH, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Room 6E01, MSC 7540, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7540.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Aging (NIA), intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with MedStar Research Institute (MRI) for a five-year cost reimbursement research contract to provide continuing clinical research support services studying aging-related diseases in addition to the expansion of ongoing longitudinal studies under the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA)/Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS) umbrella.  The purpose of the clinical services is to provide care for NIA IRP research subjects who visit a ward in Harbor Hospital dedicated to NIA IRP patients.  These subjects participate in NIA IRP clinical research initiatives (mostly related to age and age-associated diseases such as endocrinology, cardiology, clinical pharmacology, neurology, immunology/infectious diseases, genetics, and oncology).  Since 2000, MRI has been able to meet the numerous and diverse requirements of the NIA IRP clinical program, and has successfully provided clinical support to accommodate the evolving nature of the clinical research.  The statutory authority applicable to this solicitation is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302.1.  No other firm can reasonably supply the needed services.  The NIA IRP needs the following services: ---Immediate access to at least 23,000 rentable square feet of contiguous space, in a JCAHO-accredited hospital that is located within 15 minutes of the Gerontology Research Center, which is located in east Baltimore, MD; ---Ability to acquire (or if necessary to renovate) space to continue  a clinical research center which will shall contain at least 10 inpatient beds; examination and testing rooms for 9,000 to 12,500 patient visits annually; research pharmacy space; clinical laboratory space; nourishment space for food service to patients; inpatient monitoring space for nursing staff; space for medical records and equipment including structural capacity to hold two Lektrievers, all of which must be secure; and sufficient office and ancillary space for staff physicians, research fellows, nurses, research pharmacist, technicians, and clerical personnel; ---Admission of patients whose illness, as result of participation in an approved NIA IRP research protocol, warrants acute patient care as well as access to other services at the hospital such as diagnostic imaging services, pathology and laboratory support, nuclear medicine, medical consultation services, and blood bank services; housekeeping, janitorial, food service, and security services.  This organization has the prerequisite knowledge, experience, and facilities for the continuation of this proposed acquisition by reason of its preliminary and current work on this project.  The resulting contract will be for a one-year base period, commencing approximately February 2008 with four additional one-year options.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal.  If, however, there are any responsible sources who feel they possess the abilities and facilities which would enable them to perform this project, they may submit a proposal which will be considered by NIH.  See Numbered Note 22.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Portable fine and ultrafine Particle Concentrator
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-000HCCBC-2007-42248
<RESPDATE>050507

<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory has a requirement for a portable fine and ultrafine particle concentrator system.  

Purpose of Contract

NIOSH PRL Diesel Team is currently involved in a NORA project on characterization of physical, chemical, and toxicological properties of nano and ultrafine aerosols emitted by diesel powered vehicles in an occupational environment. One part of this project is dedicated to the experimental evaluation of the effects of various control technologies such as diesel particulate filter systems on diesel aerosols. These control technologies were found to reduce the mass concentrations of diesel aerosols by up to 90 percent. This large reduction in aerosol mass concentration makes collection of sufficient mass on the sample filters, for various analyses, a daunting task.

Therefore, the success of the proposed work depends on our ability to collect sufficient sample mass to allow for several different types of analysis. In order to collect samples containing sufficient mass of treated and untreated diesel aerosols the team needs a portable fine and ultrafine particle concentrator. This system would be used to collect diesel aerosol samples on the various filter media as well as directly into pulmonary fluid. These samples will then be used for in-vitro toxicity analysis and allow for a direct toxicological comparison between various diesel aerosols.  This direct comparison is a feature that will ultimately be of paramount importance in assessing the health effects of these aerosols. 

Specifications for portable fine and ultrafine particle concentrator system

The portable fine and ultrafine particle concentrator system should have the following characteristics:
	
1.	The system should be designed to concentrate nano and ultrafine aerosols in the ambient air by a factor of 10 or more.
2.	The system should not significantly alter the toxicological properties of the sampled aerosol.
3.	The system should be designed with a minimum sample flowrate of 100 lpm with the potential to upgrade the sample flowrate up to 300 lpm.
4.	The concentrator should allow for the output flows to be connected into the SKC or similar Biosampler for direct sampling on biological fluids.
5.	The system should be portable.
6.	The system should be tested calibrated, and all available supporting literature should be made available to NIOSH.

The system should be delivered to the NIOSH Diesel Facility at Lake Lynn Laboratory (2546 Spring Hill Furnace Rd., Lake Lynn, PA 15451) and installed by the supplier. Upon installation the system should be calibrated and verified to be working within the instruments published specifications. The operation of the system should be demonstrated and the instrument manual along with standard operating procedures should be made available to NIOSH. The supplier should provide long-term technical support, service and parts for the system.

Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their capabilities statement and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.  Please forward capabilities and supporting information to:  Margaret L. Mooney, Reference 000HCCBC-2007-42248, CDC, NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA  15236,  MMooney@cdc.gov.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a federal contract.  Vendors may register at www.ccr.gov.   

The government will review any/all capabilities statements and supporting information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide the requirement.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with the University of Southern California, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, 3620 South Vermont Avenue,  Los Angeles, CA  90089 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

According to our knowledge, the portable fine and ultrafine particle concentrator developed by Dr.Constantinos Sioutas, Professor at Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Southern California and his coworkers is the unique system which meets NIOSH requirements. The performance and various applications of this system are extensively described in peer reviewed literature.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This solicitation is currently available for viewing on the FedBizOps website at www.fbo.gov/.  This procurement is set-aside for total small businesses under NAICS Code 541330 (SIC 8711) with a size standard of $4,500,000.00.  The U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center, proposes to award an indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) requirements contract.  The total minimum quantity for the base year is 400 hours and the maximum is 20,000 hours.  The total minimum quantity for the option years is 200 hours and the maximum is 20,000 hours.  The minimum and maximum quantities that the government may order on an individual task order are 8 to 800 hours. In this contract the terminology delivery order means task order.  Only work directed by individual task orders issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg Consolidated Contracting Office are authorized under this contract. Requirement:  The contractor will be responsible for furnishing pilot services for the simulator. This includes travel costs. The travel costs will be negotiated with each delivery order. The simulation projects will be for a variety of ports and the pilot s for each study must be licensed for the harbor or waterway being studied.  CONCEPT:  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) is responsible for authorizing and maintaining the nations navigable waterways. Occasionally, the authorized channel must be modified. Usually this is to address a safety issue, or to improve the channel an d allow larger, deeper-drafted ships to call at the port. The COE requires a model study to evaluate nearly all proposed channel modifications. Often the model study involves real-time ship simulation. Real-time means ship movements on the simulator require the same amount of time as they do in real life. Being r eal-time allows professional mariners to operate the simulator as they would a real ship. Usually the simulation work is done on the ERDC Ship/Tow Simulator. The ERDC simulator is shown in Figure 1. However, occasionally ERDC oversees work done at private simulators.  Mariner simulation duties fall into two categories, validation and testing. Validation is the exercise during which the existing condition simulation model is adjusted until real-life conditions are replicated on the simulator. Testing is simulation of bot h proposed and existing conditions. Ship-handlers rely upon local knowledge of navigation conditions to safely maneuver vessels through a waterway. This local knowledge allows them to anticipate a force upon the ship (current, wind, bank effects, etc). If this local knowledge is not incorporated into channel design by having mariners licensed for a project site involved in the simulation exercises, the resulting channel dimensions would most likely be too large to economically dredge and maintain.  Two types of mariners are involved in a deep-draft channel design simulation project. These are ship pilots and docking pilots (sometimes referred to as docking masters). Ship pilots are licensed for particular port and handle all vessel traffic into and o ut of the port. Docking pilots are employed by the tug companies and are in control while the ships are under tug assistance. Docking pilots are typically found only in east coast ports. Ship pilots handle docking duties elsewhere. The simulation duties of all mariners are essentially the same. They are to travel to ERDC or a private facility where ERDC is overseeing simulation modeling and operate the simulator as they would a vessel in real-life. Validation mariners are expected to  make verbal comments upon the accuracy of the simulator and provide input to modifications the engineers make to improve realism. They are to observe the visual scene and radar image, noting that objects are in the proper location and that all necessary o bjects are displayed. They are to note whether or not the vessel model responds to their commands as a real vesse l would. They are to observe environmental conditions in the harbor (current, wind, waves, bank effects, etc) and provide comments as to their realism. Upon completion of the validation effort, the pilots are to complete a short form (one or two pages). Th is form, which will vary from project to project, will document the models realism and additional modifications that should be made prior to testing. This form should be completed prior to the pilots leaving the simulator facility.  Testing program mariners are to operate the simulator during runs of existing and proposed conditions. They are to provide comments as to the safety of the proposed conditions. They are to provide input into changes that could improve the proposed channels . These changes could involve channel widening, placement of aids-to-navigation, or be operational in nature. Their written input and comments will be documented on a short questionnaire to be completed after each simulator run and a final questionnaire to  be completed at the end of their testing session. The final questionnaire is due at ERDC one week after completion of the pilots testing session.  Labor Categories:   A ship pilot shall be licensed by the appropriate State Pilot Board for handling vessels in the project harbor or waterway. Any special requirements for class of license based on ship tonnage will be handled on each Delivery Order. A docking pilot shall be licensed by the appropriate State Pilot Board for handling vessels in specific reaches requiring tug assistance. Any special requirements for class of license based on ship tonnage will be handled on each Delivery Order. A tow captain shall be licensed by the appropriate board for handling the required class of towboat. Any special requirements for class of license will be handled on each Delivery Order.  Ordering Procedures:  After the Vicksburg Consolidated Contracting Office (VCCO) receives a valid requirement for these services the VCCO shall communicate the requirement to the contractor including:  " The particular qualifications required by the task for each labor category included in the order.  " The number of participants needed by labor category.  " The total hours required by labor category for the task.  " The schedule and location of the task.  Once the requirement has been communicated to the contractor the contractor shall provide VCCO with a NOT TO EXCEED (NTE) estimate of specific travel expenses necessary to complete the task in accordance with the paragraph below. If the travel estimate app ears reasonable VCCO will issue the order for the hours required and include a NTE line item for travel expenses. Once the Navigation Branch has accepted the questionnaires or other documentation required by the specific order the task is complete. The con tractor shall then invoice for the hours ordered and for actual travel expenses NTE the amount of the travel line item. Travel Expenses:  Contractor will recruit professionals with specific qualifications and experience from whatever location is the subject of the study specified in the order and arrange for these individuals to travel to a particular study location. Conseq uently, it will be necessary for the contractor to pay and be reimbursed by the Government for travel cost including meals and incidental expenses as provided for in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 31.205-46, Travel Cost. The contractor will invoi ce the Government for actual travel expenses, up to the allowable rates as provided for in FAR 31.205-46 including the regulations that are referenced therein.  Quality Control:  The contractor shall implement a quality control program (QCP) that identifies potential and actual problem areas in providing requirements of the contract as specified and results in corrective action throughout the life of the contract.   A copy must be provided to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).  Any changes to the QCP  shall be submitted to the COR not later than ten (10) working days prior to effective date of change.  The basic intent of the plan is that the Contractor is responsible for quality. Quality Assurance:  The Contracting Officer Representative (Government employee) will investigate issues and approve services provided under the contract to determine if the Contractor has complied with the performance requirements of this contract (listed  below).  Government inspections will follow FAR 52.212-4. Contract Performance:  The Government will monitor the Contractors performance under this contract using the following deficiency definitions or such other procedures as may be necessary to ascertain Contractor compliance with the contract.   1.  Completion of work after due date is a deficiency. 2.  Provide a sufficient number of qualified personnel which results in the ability to provide the sponsor with an adequate number of simulation tests for analyzing the project design alternatives, etc. 3.  Validation of accuracy of the vessel, environmental, and visual models in ship simulation study. 4.  Evaluate feasibility of safe navigation for proposed future alternatives. 5.  Provide comparative analysis of different proposed alternatives of channel alignments. 6.  Payment will not be made for unsatisfactory performance.  The Contracting Officer and COR will determine whether performance is satisfactory. It is very important that you are registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  If you are not registered in the CCR, an award CANNOT be made to your company.  You may register electronically at http://www.ccr.gov.  Registering electronically will expedite the registration process.

NO RECONDITIONED ITEMS ARE ACCEPTABLE.<BR><BR>This justification is for the procurement of Mercury automated test suite on a brand name only basis.  The use of brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured/licensed by another company. As the command and control messaging system for domestic offices and posts worldwide, it is imperative that the SMART system function according to the Departments requirements.  Sophisticated automated testing tools are essential to this purpose.  The range and scope of testing for a system of the size, complexity and importance of SMART cannot be performed solely with manual testing.  Mercury automated testing tools will provide the ability to run a long series of tests unattended often through the night.  In addition, Mercury automated testing software will simulate large numbers of users simultaneously utilizing the SMART application to determine performance metrics and ensure usability of system prior to deployment. IRM/SMART requires the Mercury automated testing products and services to be procured on a brand name only basis.  Therefore, 41 USC 253(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1, is cited at the statutory authority.<BR><BR>No one vendors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Only the products identified by the brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that maximize the Governments existing investment.  The rational follows: 1) A foundational consideration is that the nature of performance testing technology is highly specialized, requiring a significant investment in staffing and training in any given product.  While there are competing products with similar functionality, the knowledge and expertise to use each system is not easily transferable.  The cost in training, experience and project delay would be significant and far outweigh any potential savings to the government. The next factor in consideration is the fact that Mercury has a proven track record on the SMART program.  Mercury was used during an early laboratory test of SMART and successfully tested a simulation of1,500 concurrent users (the estimated pilot population) accessing a prescribed set of solution allowing the Government to make major course corrections in the design and architecture of the SMART System.  The licenses for the original mercury test tools have expired.  New licenses are now needed to ensure the major design and architecture changes to SMART have fixed the performance problems identified in the tests that were conducted previously. The SMART program office received Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) services from the Gartner Company.  Gartners independent research is widely recognized as an authoritative source of IT trends and recommendations.  SMART relied on Gartner research and professional expertise in selecting Mercury.  According to Gartner, Mercury dominates the automated testing software market with over 50% market share.  Gartners ranks Mercury as the Market leader in terms of ability to execute and completeness of vision.  In addition, Gartners onsite IV&V experts have stated that  the Mercury family is the strongest /broadest in overall capacity.<BR><BR>A)Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging.

NO RECONDITIONED ITEMS ARE ACCEPTABLE.<BR><BR>This justification is for the procurement of Mercury automated test suite on a brand name only basis.  The use of brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured/licensed by another company. As the command and control messaging system for domestic offices and posts worldwide, it is imperative that the SMART system function according to the Departments requirements.  Sophisticated automated testing tools are essential to this purpose.  The range and scope of testing for a system of the size, complexity and importance of SMART cannot be performed solely with manual testing.  Mercury automated testing tools will provide the ability to run a long series of tests unattended often through the night.  In addition, Mercury automated testing software will simulate large numbers of users simultaneously utilizing the SMART application to determine performance metrics and ensure usability of system prior to deployment. IRM/SMART requires the Mercury automated testing products and services to be procured on a brand name only basis.  Therefore, 41 USC 253(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1, is cited at the statutory authority.<BR><BR>No one vendors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Only the products identified by the brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that maximize the Governments existing investment.  The rational follows: 1) A foundational consideration is that the nature of performance testing technology is highly specialized, requiring a significant investment in staffing and training in any given product.  While there are competing products with similar functionality, the knowledge and expertise to use each system is not easily transferable.  The cost in training, experience and project delay would be significant and far outweigh any potential savings to the government. The next factor in consideration is the fact that Mercury has a proven track record on the SMART program.  Mercury was used during an early laboratory test of SMART and successfully tested a simulation of1,500 concurrent users (the estimated pilot population) accessing a prescribed set of solution allowing the Government to make major course corrections in the design and architecture of the SMART System.  The licenses for the original mercury test tools have expired.  New licenses are now needed to ensure the major design and architecture changes to SMART have fixed the performance problems identified in the tests that were conducted previously. The SMART program office received Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) services from the Gartner Company.  Gartners independent research is widely recognized as an authoritative source of IT trends and recommendations.  SMART relied on Gartner research and professional expertise in selecting Mercury.  According to Gartner, Mercury dominates the automated testing software market with over 50% market share.  Gartners ranks Mercury as the Market leader in terms of ability to execute and completeness of vision.  In addition, Gartners onsite IV&V experts have stated that  the Mercury family is the strongest /broadest in overall capacity.<BR><BR>A)Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.

<RESPDATE>051807
<CONTACT>Connie  Houpt, 405/954-7820
<DESC>Amendment 1 issued to add the following statement: Hand-carried proposals (or proposals sent by overnight delivery) shall be delivered to Room 313 of the Multi-Purpose Building located at 6500 South MacArthur Boulevard, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73169.  Submittals must be sealed and labeled as follows:  Qualified Vendors List 2007, Attn: Connie Houpt; due 2:00 p.m. CST, May 18, 2007. The Federal Aviation Administration, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) in Oklahoma City, OK, is re-establishing its Qualified Vendors List (QVL) used for FAA procurements for the manufacture of modification kits.  These modification kits are used primarily in navigational aids, communications, radar, weather, and environmental areas in support of the National Airspace System (NAS) equipment to improve the safety and system/equipment reliability and supportability.  To be considered for inclusion on the QVL, the following minimum qualification requirements of this initial Screening Information Request (SIR) must be met.  Existing QVL vendors must respond to this announcement by providing all required information for evaluation. (A) The QVL is 100 percent set aside for small business concerns.  The FAA Acquisition Management System defines a small business as, "... a business, including it's affiliates, that is independently owned and operated and not dominant in producing the products or performing the services being purchased, and one that qualifies as a small business under the Federal Government's criteria and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standards."  For this procurement, vendors must be classified as a small business under NAICS code 334511 (750 employees).  Vendors shall complete and submit the Business Declaration Form (Attachment 1) with required documentation. (B) Vendors must have a manufacturing facility located within a 150-mile radius of MMAC at time of this announcement.  The address of the manufacturing facility shall be provided at time of submission of documentation.  This requirement is for the purpose of providing technical guidance, monitoring manufacturing processes, witnessing factory tests, monitoring packaging procedures, and identifying potential problem areas in a timely manner. (C) Vendors shall submit a description of their capability to meet the following seven criteria:  1. Technical Documentation - supplier catalogs and/or Internet access for research and acquisition of supplies and materials;  2. Manufacturing Capabilities - fabrication and manufacturing capabilities;  3. Test Capabilities - equipment needed to provide power to circuit inputs and measure resultant outputs of fabricated mechanical, electrical, and electronic items;  4. Packaging and Labeling Capabilities - equipment and materials needed to meet FAA packaging and labeling requirements as found in ASTM-D-3951, ASTM-D-4169, and MIL-STD-129 (Attachment 2);  5. Quality Control - quality control system that complies with FAA-STD-013d, Quality Control Program Requirements (Attachment 3);  6. Logistics and Inventory - sufficient space for receiving, assembly, storage, and shipping of modification kit parts and supplies; and  7. Software and Firmware - capability in-house or have sources for software and firmware needs.   This documentation is limited to a maximum of ten pages for all seven criteria.  To receive consideration, all documentation required in the previous paragraphs must be provided, along with a name and telephone number of a point of contact, to the following address:  FAA/MMAC, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK  73125, Attn: Connie Houpt, AMQ-210, with reference made to Qualified Vendors List 2007, by 2:00 p.m. CST, Friday, May 18, 2007.  If required, a subsequent SIR will provide further qualification criteria to enable the FAA to evaluate and then down-select vendors for the QVL.  The FAA reserves the right to limit the number of vendors selected for the QVL.  Data submitted that is found to be false will result in permanent removal from consideration for this QVL.  The contracting officer will dispose of incomplete packages without further action unless an inadequate number of responses are received. The FAA reserves the right to conduct an on-site survey with companies interested in this requirement.  Special consideration may be given to Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB) and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses for participation in the QVL. All vendors being considered for inclusion on the QVL must meet the criteria for determination of responsibility as defined in the FAA's Acquisition Management System.  To be determined responsible, a prospective contractor must: 1. Have adequate resources (financial, technical, etc.) to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain them; 2. Be able to comply with the required or proposed delivery or performance schedule, considering all existing business commitments; 3. Have a satisfactory performance record; 4. Have a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics; and 5. Be otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations. The FAA reserves the right to request business and financial references to aid in the determination of responsibility. Re-establishment of this QVL will be a unilateral decision of the FAA and will be reviewed annually.  The FAA reserves the right to include additional vendors on the QVL.  The decision to remove a vendor from this QVL will be based on performance and the ability to be competitive.

Space Threat Assessment Testbed (STAT) 

AMENDMENT 04
	
This is an amendment to a request for information and not a solicitation.

The purpose of this amendment is to provide the attached draft agenda for the 15-16 May STAT Industry Days at Arnold AFB, TN.  The main focus of this meeting will be the CTEIP Program Management Plan and the STAT facility concept of operations.  A tour of the space environment facilities will also be provided.  Please contact Ms Burnice Banaszak, (931) 454-4424, Burnice.banaszak@arnold.af.mil, if you plan to attend.   

The draft STAT Program Management Plan will be posted to FedBizOpps in a subsequent amendment to this RFI not later than 30 April for review prior to this meeting.  

In order to maintain continuity and ensure no prospective bidders miss the discussions, we have reserved the morning of the 15th and all day the 17th  of May for Ms. Kathy Swanson, Contracting Officer, to be available to discuss contract strategies one-on-one with prospective bidders.  If you would like to share your experiences with various contract types with Ms. Swanson, you may sign up for a 30-minute slot with Ms. Banaszak when you register to attend STAT Industry Days.

On the 17-18 May, AEDC will be hosting a Space Environments Course geared toward space effects and satellite design.  We are currently investigating options for Industry partners to fund their personnel to attend this training as well.  If you are interested in this training, please let Ms. Banaszak know.  As soon as we get more information on Industry attendance, we will post an amendment to the RFI. 

Since the main focus of the Industry Days meeting will be the CTEIP Program Management Plan and the STAT facility concept of operations, we anticipate this meeting to be held at the UNCLASSIFIED level, though some discussion may venture into collateral SECRET.  We are planning an in-depth review at the TS/SCI level to be held in Chantilly in June 2007.

FYI.  The STAT will be a testbed facility that will be used to test space system survivability against natural, environmental, and man-made effects.  STAT will provide connectivity to a satellite control center (SOC) for systems under test in order to train space operators to recognize threats and aid in the development of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to mitigate the effects of those threats.  STAT is envisioned to include space chambers with realistic natural space environmental conditions, as well as integrated representative threat sources.   STAT Spiral 1 will develop the technology to integrate and control the various environmental sources and build a capability to test sub-system size components and microsats.

The Grantee, the Ministry of Infrastructure Development of Tanzania, invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study to support the Ministry of Infrastructure Development in developing a National ICT Backbone Network including a detailed study of projected traffic to be carried over the Tanzania-anchored regional backhaul networks to and from the submarine cables. The National ICT backbone network will increase direct regional communications capacity and global connectivity at a much lower price than current satellite circuits.

Tanzania does not have a national long distance network that connects its major population centers to smaller towns, rural areas, or national border points with its neighbors.  To alleviate this problem, the Ministry of Infrastructure Development is planning to implement a Tanzania National ICT Backbone Network. The backbone network will also form the foundation for a Tanzania-anchored regional backhaul network by providing connectivity and international links from the proposed submarine cable landing station in Dar es Salaam to regional backhaul networks with neighboring countries on Tanzania?s border. 

As the Grantee, the Ministry of Infrastructure Development will oversee the Feasibility Study. The Ministry will be supported by the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Agency (TCRA), which will take the lead in developing the regulatory framework for the project, in particular ensuring open access, a fair and competitive pricing environment, and interconnection guidelines for the Tanzania National ICT Backbone.

The Terms of Reference for the Grant include the following tasks:

Task 1:  Conduct a Requirement Analysis of the Tanzania National ICT Backbone and Interconnection Points to Regional Backhaul Networks
Task 2:  Market Analysis and Traffic Study Specifications
Task 3: Develop Technical Network Design, Equipment Specifications, and Project Costs for the Tanzania National ICT Backbone
Task 4:  Business and Financial Model 
Task 5:  Regulatory Framework 
Task 6:  Development Impact Assessment 
Task 7:  Environmental Impact Assessment 
Task 8:  Assistance with Project Financing 
Task 9:  Prepare Procurement Documents
Task 10: Final Report

Specifically, the Terms of Reference for this project include:

1)  Background Research
2)  Requirements Analysis 
3)  Technical Network Design, Equipment Specifications, and Project Costs
4)  Business and Management Implementation Scenarios 
5)  Regulatory and Legal Framework
6)  Project Financing
7)  Environmental Impact Assessment 
8)  Development Impact Assessment 
9)  Final Report 

If the Project is implemented, it would provide high speed broadband connectivity, reaching currently underserved populations and significantly reducing the current prohibitive cost of telephony and Internet services in Burkina Faso.

The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 332919 and the corresponding Federal Supply Code (FSC) is 4730.

By submitting a quote the vendor will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, or debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal Agency.  Failure to so represent may be grounds for refusing to accept the quote.  POC:  brandy.harris@navy.mil or scott.wilkins@navy.mil

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of DataTrax System.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The Kentucky Consular Centers (KCC) Alternative Processing Center (APC) is responsible for maintaining a viable operational environment for a growing number of Consular Affairs (CA) mission-critical systems.  Although the Center has been able to maintain a high level of facility readiness for these mission-critical systems through thoughtful planning, a growing number of unscheduled events are being addressed through a reactive process and not a proactive process.  This scenario is of great concern to CA management because the number facility management support personnel are largely fixed and system monitoring tasks, that are performed manually, are prone to human error. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. KCC facility management personnel researched available solutions and determined that an automated monitoring system, that would proactively notify facilities management personnel before a problem occurred, was required to maintain the required level of facility reliability at KCC.  After reviewing  market offerings, KCC facilities management personnel determined that the DataTrax system currently deployed and being used by the State Departments IRM Division in Washington, DC was the best overall monitoring system for the KCC APC.<BR><BR>That system is attractively priced (see attached), has the required functionality, and can be integrated with the existing IRM system as part of an enterprise monitoring solution.   This DataTrax system maximizes the availability of essential mission-critical IT, communications and process systems by:  	Simplifying and managing electrical, environmental, and life/safety equipment from one system 	Providing a total package with complete software, hardware and installation services for APC systems 	Enabling capacity planning, instantaneous failure prediction and trend analysis 	Providing a solution that scales to the needs of the KCC APC 	Managing all the interfaces required at the KCC and providing an intuitive graphical interface that accurately depicts potential failures.<BR><BR>With the criticality of the Appalachian Processing Centers support to CA/VO, DHS, Fraud Prevention, Facial Recognition, and now Passport services, we cannot afford to have equipment failure.  The intent is to increase the abilities of FMS services so that we may remain pro-active in our response and not reactive.  With the DataTrax system in place at Main State, equipment failures have gone to zero in a 7 year time line.<BR><BR>

<RESPDATE>051807
<CONTACT>Connie  Houpt, 405/954-7820
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) in Oklahoma City, OK, is re-establishing its Qualified Vendors List (QVL) used for FAA procurements for the manufacture of modification kits.  These modification kits are used primarily in navigational aids, communications, radar, weather, and environmental areas in support of the National Airspace System (NAS) equipment to improve the safety and system/equipment reliability and supportability.  To be considered for inclusion on the QVL, the following minimum qualification requirements of this initial Screening Information Request (SIR) must be met.  Existing QVL vendors must respond to this announcement by providing all required information for evaluation. (A) The QVL is 100 percent set aside for small business concerns.  The FAA Acquisition Management System defines a small business as, "... a business, including it's affiliates, that is independently owned and operated and not dominant in producing the products or performing the services being purchased, and one that qualifies as a small business under the Federal Government's criteria and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standards."  For this procurement, vendors must be classified as a small business under NAICS code 334511 (750 employees).  Vendors shall complete and submit the Business Declaration Form (Attachment 1) with required documentation. (B) Vendors must have a manufacturing facility located within a 150-mile radius of MMAC at time of this announcement.  The address of the manufacturing facility shall be provided at time of submission of documentation.  This requirement is for the purpose of providing technical guidance, monitoring manufacturing processes, witnessing factory tests, monitoring packaging procedures, and identifying potential problem areas in a timely manner. (C) Vendors shall submit a description of their capability to meet the following seven criteria:  1. Technical Documentation - supplier catalogs and/or Internet access for research and acquisition of supplies and materials;  2. Manufacturing Capabilities - fabrication and manufacturing capabilities;  3. Test Capabilities - equipment needed to provide power to circuit inputs and measure resultant outputs of fabricated mechanical, electrical, and electronic items;  4. Packaging and Labeling Capabilities - equipment and materials needed to meet FAA packaging and labeling requirements as found in ASTM-D-3951, ASTM-D-4169, and MIL-STD-129 (Attachment 2);  5. Quality Control - quality control system that complies with FAA-STD-013d, Quality Control Program Requirements (Attachment 3);  6. Logistics and Inventory - sufficient space for receiving, assembly, storage, and shipping of modification kit parts and supplies; and  7. Software and Firmware - capability in-house or have sources for software and firmware needs.   This documentation is limited to a maximum of ten pages for all seven criteria.  To receive consideration, all documentation required in the previous paragraphs must be provided, along with a name and telephone number of a point of contact, to the following address:  FAA/MMAC, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK  73125, Attn: Connie Houpt, AMQ-210, with reference made to Qualified Vendors List 2007, by Friday, May 18, 2007.  If required, a subsequent SIR will provide further qualification criteria to enable the FAA to evaluate and then down-select vendors for the QVL.  The FAA reserves the right to limit the number of vendors selected for the QVL.  Data submitted that is found to be false will result in permanent removal from consideration for this QVL.  The contracting officer will dispose of incomplete packages without further action unless an inadequate number of responses are received. The FAA reserves the right to conduct an on-site survey with companies interested in this requirement.  Special consideration may be given to Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB) and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses for participation in the QVL. All vendors being considered for inclusion on the QVL must meet the criteria for determination of responsibility as defined in the FAA's Acquisition Management System.  To be determined responsible, a prospective contractor must: 1. Have adequate resources (financial, technical, etc.) to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain them; 2. Be able to comply with the required or proposed delivery or performance schedule, considering all existing business commitments; 3. Have a satisfactory performance record; 4. Have a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics; and 5. Be otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations. The FAA reserves the right to request business and financial references to aid in the determination of responsibility. Re-establishment of this QVL will be a unilateral decision of the FAA and will be reviewed annually.  The FAA reserves the right to include additional vendors on the QVL.  The decision to remove a vendor from this QVL will be based on performance and the ability to be competitive.

<DESC>The Government has a requirement for a strategic partner for Operational Test and Evaluation Support for the Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA), Quantico, VA.  This Sources Sought Notice is issued to notify vendors that are capable of providing the support identified in the attached Draft Statement of Work (SOW) and give the vendors an opportunity to ask questions and provide comments concerning the Draft SOW.  One of the assumptions made by the Government Team is due to the complexity of the multiple commodities tested by MCOTEA and the broad spectrum of required technical specialties, this effort cannot be completed by a single vendor.  Therefore, a teaming approach is encouraged. This is also an opportunity to provide potential offerors an opportunity to request a Government Advisory Opinion regarding Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI).  The vendors are encouraged to review Title 10, US Code Section 2399, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 9.5 prior to responding concerning an OCI.  The vendor must describe the specific work performed and the duration thereof as either prime or subcontractor.  The vendor must state whether or not it considers its involvement an organizational conflict of interest prohibited by the referenced statute and regulation or an appearance of such a conflict that could adversely impact the test and evaluation mission.   The Government  anticipates making an award based on a teaming approach on a Full and Open Competition Basis with a percentage set-aside for a Small Business.  The anticipated performance period is a one- year base period with four one-year options. The Contract Type is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery Indifinite Quantitiy (IDIQ) contract with both Cost Reimbursable and Firm Fixed Priced task orders issued referred to as Task Action Plans (TAPs).   The contractor is encouraged to provide alternatives to allow for the Government to be co-located with the Contractor Staff support. The Government intends to issue a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) on or about June 7, 2007 with a Pre-solicitation Conference scheduled to be conducted at Quantico Marine Base, VA on or about June 18, 2007.  In preparation for the conference, questions and comments on the DRFP will be encouraged.  This is not an RFP and vendors should not submit formal proposals until the RFP is posted.   The anticipated NAICS Codes are 541380, 541439, 541611, 541690, 541910, 561410, and 611430.  Also please indicate if your company can be a prime contractor for this effort or, if not, whether your company can be a subcontractor.   Interested vendors may submit Concept Papers not exceeding 5 pages challenging or supporting the assumption stated above.  Please include details explaining your concept, its advantages, and overall efficiency and efficacy.  OCI concerns, and Questions or comments concerning the draft SOW and the Sources Sought Notice shall be submitted in writing, NLT 1600 EST on 21 May 2007, to the Contracting Officer at 3035 Barnett Ave, Quantico, Virginia 22134-5014 or e-mailed to lashunya.johnson-vin@usmc.mil.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice for written information only. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or reimburse the costs incurred by potential offerors in providing the information requested herein. In preparation for an upcoming procurement, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Climate Change Division  (CCD) is conducting market research to determine potential sources for services involving national agricultural greenhouse gas inventory reporting of soil organic carbon and soil nitrous oxide emissions, using FAR Part 15 ? Contracting by Negotiation Procedures. The EPA Climate Change Division develops the national inventory for greenhouse gas emissions and sinks for reporting to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  In the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses Sector (AFOLU), soil Nitrous Oxide is a key source and both soil Carbon and Nitrous Oxide sources are of interest to US policy makers for purposes of carbon management and greenhouse gas mitigation.  Consequently, advanced Tier 3 approaches have been developed for these sources by customizing inventory methods using computer simulation models (IPCC 2006, see EPA 2006).  These Tier 3 methods shall be used in conjunction with Tier 1 methods to provide the complete estimate for soil Carbon and Nitrous Oxide on an annual basis. Under the proposed contract, the Contractor shall: 1) Prepare annual agricultural soil Carbon stock change and soil Nitrous Oxide emission estimates for the Inventory of US Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks; 2) Implement planned improvements to the soil Carbon and Nitrous Oxide inventory estimates; and 3) Provide quick turnaround assignments on issues related to Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses Sector (AFOLU).   Specific annual deliverables shall include text, tables and summary spreadsheets documenting the data, methods and results from the soil Carbon and Nitrous Oxide analyses; agricultural soil Carbon and Nitrous Oxide methodology annexes for inclusion in the US GHG Inventory; maps and appendices depicting variation in state-level carbon stock changes and Nitrous Oxide emissions; data inputs for the Common Reporting Format (CRF) Tables; a Quality Control/Assurance Report for each inventory assessment; and responses to reviewer comments from the expert and public review comment periods.  Detailed information on the requirement is provided via a draft copy of the Statement of Work (SOW), which will be posted on the EPA OAM website by April 20, 2007 at http://www.epa.gov/oam/hpod/#sources. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS. This is a request for interested potential offerors to submit a brief capability statement demonstrating how they plan to meet the above requirement. Submissions shall be limited to no more than two pages. Standard brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this notice.   Submitted capability statements should include the following: (1) Name of vendor; (2) Contact information (address, telephone, facsimile, e-mail); (3) Technical description of capabilities in meeting the requirement; (4) Experience in providing inventory estimates and the required documentation for soil organic Carbon stock changes in croplands and grasslands, and soil Nitrous Oxide emissions from all managed lands disaggregated to the state level; and (5) Business size and classification (small, large, small-disadvantaged, certified 8(a), HUBZone, woman-owned, service-disabled veteran, Native American, etc.)  Businesses should submit an electronic copy of the requested information to Contract Specialist Nicole Humphrey at humphrey.nicole@epa.gov no later than May 3, 2006, 4:00 p.m. EST. Based upon information currently available, the Government does not anticipate fulfilling this requirement through a small business set-aside. The method of competition will be determined after all responses to this notice have been evaluated.  No feedback will be provided regarding individual capabilities statements.

<DESC>A.	 General Information

     The Heartland Region, TRBO Region 5, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 5 Army, Navy, and Air Force, medical treatment facilities in Ohio, Illinois, and Kentucky announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Head and Shoe Covers. The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 
  The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Wright Patterson Air Force Base Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Illinois, Naval Health Clinics of Great Lakes Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital Ft Campbell Kentucky, and Ireland Army Community Hospital Ft Knox Kentucky.

     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The TRBO will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is June 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria.    
   
Point of Contact Phyllis Targett 937-257-9075 phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Heartland Region is seeking product line items in the category of Head and Shoe Covers. The estimated total volume for this region for this product line is $24,791. This is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period. 

At the request of the Heartland Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Offerors

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil (937)257-9075 before 4:00 P.M. EST
This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Heartland Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.
Phase I. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. All technical criteria are equally weighted.
Phase II. The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be non- clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. A three-week period will be allotted to vendors for shipment. Samples must be received by COB at 4PM local time, 21 calendar days after request. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.
The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert-like one to five rating scale where one is equal to not acceptable and five is equal to highly acceptable. All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 

Phase III. After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Heartland Region. Vendors who fail to offer discounted prices will be disqualified from RIA award consideration.
Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year base period with the option to extend for one or two-years (not to exceed 5 years). Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  
  

1. Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation

The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the quoters responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the quoter has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items; 4) the quoter has, or is obtaining, a distribution agreement covering the items with the Prime Vendor for the region; and 5) the quoter intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and 6) the quoters information provided is factually correct (any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.)

<DESC>A Sources Sought for Potential Partnering for Spacecraft and Instrument Flight Hardware.  This is a Request For Information (RFI) issued solely for information and planning purposes -- It does not constitute a Request For Proposal -- This RFI serves to increase opportunities for interested parties and openly solicit potential partners by requesting specific information that will be used to offer teaming relationships with industrial partners for developing MSFC proposals in response to upcoming NASA Announcements of Opportunity (AO) for MIDEX (Medium Class Explorer), Discovery and the Earth Science Pathfinder (ESSP) instrument payloads.  A deviation has been granted to support these AOs permitting NASA Principal Investigators (PIs) to enter into partnerships with hardware fabricators using the same guidelines as non-NASA PIs.  Accordingly, if a NASA PI investigation is selected and the hardware fabricator proposed in that investigation meets the guidelines of NASA FAR Supplement 1872.502(a)(3)(i) through (iii) for award without further competition, then NASA may award a prime contract to the hardware partner.  The AOs will contain language informing the community that if a Government Principal Investigator is selected, NASA reserves the right to award a prime contract to the proposed hardware partner under the authority of the AO selection.  MSFC envisions a teaming arrangement where the industrial partner will act as the Prime Contractor and will be responsible for providing a complete mission design, schedules for development, and cost estimates for the flight and ground support elements of a space flight system used to meet a specific scientific research objective.  Responses to this RFI are solicited both from instrument and spacecraft development contractors having experience as discussed in this RFI.  The industrial partner may provide direct inputs into the MSFC proposal associated with the hardware development functions.  NASA/MSFC does not intend to reimburse the industrial partner for the costs for preparing these inputs.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified sources that are interested in pursuing this type of arrangement.  Potential industrial partners will be identified from the responders to this request.  One or more of these potential partners will be provided specific competition-sensitive requirements for flight hardware and ground support equipment and asked to produce information on their approach to meeting the particular requirements. MSFC intends to select a single industrial partner for the instrument design for participation in the proposal. An additional partner may be selected for the design of specific customized optical components or detectors. Typical hardware/software requirements include those imposed by accommodation on a science spacecraft - such as structural, geometric, size, positioning, power and command/control/data interfaces, lifetime, and other resource allocations.  Experiment requirements might include sensor performance requirements and general or specific detector designs.  The instrument for the MIDEX opportunity is intended for data collection from a source or sources emitting electromagnetic radiation at wavelengths covering a broad spectrum from the ultraviolet through infrared.  Interested parties are to provide information on experience in the development of instruments and/or spacecraft or satellites for science missions, for integrating instruments into spacecraft and spacecraft to launch vehicles. Include general specifications of types of instruments, spacecraft, and launch systems used, and performance history.  Include information on cost and schedule performance on past programs. Limit responses to no more than 5 pages -- Responses to this RFI should be submitted in writing to Dr. John M. Davis/MSFC/VP62 no later than May 26, 2007.  If you have provided similar information in the past 12 months it is only necessary to submit a letter expressing your continued interest.  For additional information concerning this request, contact Dr. John M. Davis (John.M.Davis@nasa.gov). When responding reference [RFI-MSFC-NSSTC-MIDEX-ESSP]. Comments may also be forwarded to Iris Walter, DFS, Inc., Contracts Administrator, via electronic transmission at iris.r.walter@nasa.gov or by facsimile transmission at 256-961-7723. This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.	Respondents will not be notified of the results. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/MSFC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=62	It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet cite for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice Only for 8(a) Interests.  Acquisition, Management and Integration Center, Langley AFB VA, is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy to obtain contractor support for non-personal services in support of Surrogate Unmanned Aerial System (SUAS) Green Flag Exercise Support at Barksdale AFB LA.  The objective of this PWS is to provide an economical alternative to deploying an MQ-1 UAS to support ACC sponsored GFE training events.  The focus of this initiative is on sensor, voice and data communication capabilities having sufficient fidelity to mimic those provided by the Predator system, and to provide a training capability that is currently unavailable for participating Command and Control (C2) units, aircrews, and ground parties.  The initial period of performance will begin 1 October 2007              30 September 2008, with the possibility of option years being included.  The government expects to make an award on or about August 2007.  This acquisition will be issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP) on or about June 2007.  A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) will be issued in conjunction with this sources sought notice.  The predecessor contract for SUAS services was awarded as an 8(a) set aside.  The government seeks industry input to determine if this acquisition should remain an 8(a) set-aside under the auspices of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 541519 with a size standard of $23.M.  Interested 8(a) business who are certified and qualified as a 8(a)  in NAICS 541519 shall submit a package outlining their capabilities in key areas as determined by the government as relevant to the performance of this requirement.  Interested 8(a) concerns are encouraged to respond and submit their capability statement(s) to this office NLT COB on 2 May 2007.  Please provide these packages via email to MSgt Pamela Mitchell, ACC AMIC/PKB, 757-225-5797, Pamela.mitchell@langley.af.mil .  Comments on the draft PWS are not requested at this time.  The government plans to use the Internet and e-mail as the primary means of disseminating and exchanging information.  Hard copies of documents posted on FBO will not be made available.  The government will provide email confirmation of receipt of your statements.  If companies do not receive an email confirmation after submitting their package, they are urged to verify receipt telephonically.

<DESC>THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR QUOTES. The Department of Homeland Security, Office for Bombing Prevention (OBP) has been tasked to conduct a national level inventory of private sector products, services, and solutions related to explosives and Improvised Explosive Device (IED) security. This information is critical to supporting objectives identified by the President in Homeland Security Presidential Directive-19 (Combating Terrorist Use of Explosives in the United States) located at http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/hspd19/ and by Congress in P.L. 109-295 located at http://thomas.loc.gov/ .  The goals on the request include:

1)	Identify and catalog proven and available Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) products, services, and solutions, such as training, explosive detection, or IED response tools.  
2)	Identify and catalog qualified sources for these COTS products. 
3)	Identify any Research & Development efforts currently underway, related to bombing prevention / IED security.
4)	Compare the data gathered against known and projected requirements. 
5)	Develop recommendations for integration into USG strategies to reduce vulnerability of the nations critical infrastructure / key resources (CI/KR) to explosive devices. 
6)	Publish an inventory of available products, services, and solutions.

This will be a two-phased process: first, an initial top-screen of general information (this memorandum), followed by a request for additional information as needed.  For the initial top-screen, please identify explosives or IED security-related efforts underway by your organization and provide the following information on each:

1)	Organization Name
2)	Product/Service/Solution Title
3)	Product/Service/Solution Executive Summary
4)	Product/Service/Solution Unit Costs
5)	Product/Service/Solution Inception Date
6)	Number of Deliveries/Deployments Since Inception
7)	Product/Service/Solution Point of Contact. 

Please be as detailed as possible.  Some examples of relevant products/services/solutions include those in the area of detection, incident response, physical security, emergency management, public awareness and vigilance, or training related to explosives or IEDs.

DHS will integrate this information with detailed follow-on requests, as needed, to determine current national capabilities and coordinate subsequent recommendations per HSPD-19 requirements.  

The data gathered will be used to satisfy congressional mandates and objectives within Presidential directives. Inventories of ongoing activity will provide decision makers key information related to resources required for a robust bombing prevention capability.

<SUBJECT>Q -- Managed Care Support Services - Request for Information
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The TRICARE Management Activity invites potential sources to provide an industry perspective to the TRICARE Program in order that the structure of the third generation of TRICARE Managed Care Support (MCS) contracts may be developed to reflect best practices and innovative solutions to the many military health care challenges.  Input and information may be provided in writing or through one-on-one meetings with the TRICARE Management Activity.  One-on-one meetings are intended to allow full disclosure in an environment that protects any information shared.  The one-on-one meetings will be held face-to-face at TRICARE Management Activity Office in Aurora, Colorado; and will occur between June 5, and June 16, 2006.  If you are interested in providing input into the future of the military health care system through the services provided under contracts for Managed Care Support, please contact Mr. Scott Lamond, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at scott.lamond@tma.osd.mil no later then May 19, 2006, to make arrangements for a one-on-one meeting.  If a face-to-face meeting is not possible, conference calls, or submission of written information will be considered.

Overview:  The Defense Health Program (DHP) consists of direct care provided by DoD personnel through Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) and clinics and purchased care provided through Managed Care Support Contractors. This overview is to describe the purchased care portion of the DHP.  Additional information is available on the TRICARE Management Activity World Wide Web site at www.tricare.osd.mil. In order to fulfill the purchased care needs of the DHP, sources/contractors must provide all services necessary to fully support DoD's primary wartime readiness mission while supplementing the services provided through DoD owned and/or operated health care facilities.  Information from sources/contractors should address providing clinical and administrative services that are comparable to the best offered in the civilian community and fulfilling the objectives complying with the scope and structure of TRICARE; i.e., benefits and beneficiary liabilities, including technical requirements specified under the TRICARE uniform health care benefit. Information must address the expertise of managed care organizations and health benefit administrators in incorporating and operating the best business model and practices of the private sector in support of DoD healthcare delivery. Any contractor selected for contract award will have to provide the DoD with clinical and administrative services that are comparable to the best offered in the civilian community. Information is sought to assure that the services will be delivered in a manner that achieves a fully integrated health care delivery and financing system for all Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries.

Current Status of the Defense Health Program (DHP): The medical mission of the Department of Defense is to maintain readiness through health and medical services provided to the armed forces during military operations, and to provide health and medical services/support to the members of the armed forces, their family members and others entitled to DoD health care. The MHS must be prepared not only to provide a high quality, cost-effective health care benefit to its eligible members during peacetime, but also must be prepared to support the armed forces during exercises, contingencies, operations other than war, and in wartime.

In support of its readiness mission, the MHS maintains a system of MTFs and clinics, located in DoD catchment areas, that provide direct care to active duty personnel and to others who are eligible for military health benefits if space is available. Although the number and size of direct care facilities has declined in recent years, it remains important that MTFs are optimized in order to maintain the clinical skills of military clinical staff to support medical readiness. Currently, the direct care system cannot fully support the total demand for health care services; therefore, TRICARE uses the direct care system as the main delivery system, and through the awarding of MCS contracts, augments the direct care system through a civilian network of providers and facilities serving its eligible members.

MCS services apply to approximately 9.2 million active and retired members of the Uniformed Services: the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Marine Corps, the U. S. Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service and the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, their spouses and children and their surviving family members subject to the provisions of Chapter 55 of Title 10, U.S.C. Also eligible are Medal of Honor recipients (Chapter 55 of Title 10, U.S.C., Section 1074h.).

Currently, TRICARE provides three health care options for beneficiariesPrime, Extra, and Standard.   TRICARE Prime is similar to an HMO with a Point of Service option and requires beneficiary enrollment. All Active Duty personnel are TRICARE Prime enrollees, although they are required to receive all of their care either in the MTF or under special rules that apply to Active Duty healthcare. Active Duty family members may elect to enroll and are not required to pay an annual enrollment fee or co-pays for care delivered in the network or the direct care system; however, other eligible beneficiaries pay an annual enrollment fee to enroll in TRICARE Prime. TRICARE Extra, which requires no enrollment, is an option in which the beneficiary may choose to use a provider in the contractor-developed network, with reduced cost-sharing for a particular episode of care, but is not restricted to use the network. TRICARE Standard is a fee-for-service option in which the beneficiary is free to use any authorized provider. The three options of TRICARE are described fully in 32 CFR Part 199.17 and 199.18 which may be accessed on the TRICARE Management Activity World Wide Web site at www.tricare.osd.mil.

Currently, TRICARE Prime enrollees receive all primary care from a Primary Care Manager (PCM), who may be located at the MTF or may be a civilian provider in the MCS provider network. The MCS contractor is responsible for providing MTF enrollees and Medicare dual-eligible beneficiaries with other services such as network referrals, population health, medical management, and beneficiary education. Therefore, a MCS contractor interface with MTF enrollees will largely occur in catchment areas, with workload driven by the MTFs capability and capacity.  The MCS contractor is currently gains or loses profit based on the cost of (a cost plus incentive fee arrangement) all care and services provided to Prime enrollees (other than Active Duty members) having either MTF or civilian PCMs, and for all TRICARE Extra and TRICARE Standard care.  The Government encourages potential sources to comment on this arrangement understanding that provisions of law dictate that health care costs be underwritten by the Managed Care Contractor.  The MHS is organized into TRICARE Regions within the United States and around the world.  Currently, at a minimum, a MCS contractor is required to establish a TRICARE Prime network in each catchment area surrounding a MTF and in the area of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) sites.

The Department of Defense (DoD) requires delivery of a uniform health care benefit in the form of uniform healthcare quality, structure and patient cost-sharing. However, DoD is also interested in taking advantage of the expertise of the civilian sector and incorporating best practices.

Proposed Contract Performance Objectives:  A world-class health system that supports the military mission by fostering, protecting, sustaining and restoring health is our vision for fulfilling the MHS mission To enhance DoD and our Nations security by providing health support for the full range of military operations and sustaining the health of all those entrusted to our care.  As noted above, this is accomplished through an integrated health care delivery system consisting of our military hospitals and clinics, as well as, services purchased in the civilian sector.  The TRICARE Program is accomplishing this mission today through Managed Care Support Contracts (MCSC) that contains the following Contract Objectives.  These Objectives are not listed by order of importance.

Objective 1  In partnership with the Military Health System (MHS), optimize the delivery of health care services in the direct care system (see the definition of Military Treatment Facility Optimization in the TRICARE Operations Manual, Appendix A) for all MHS beneficiaries (active duty personnel, Military Treatment Facility (MTF) enrollees, civilian network enrollees, and non-enrollees).

Objective 2 - Beneficiary satisfaction at the highest level possible throughout the period of performance, through the delivery of world-class health care as well as customer friendly program services. Beneficiary must be highly satisfied with each and every service provided by the contractor during each and every contact.

Objective 3 - Attain best value health care (See TRICARE Operations Manual, Appendix A) services in support of the MHS mission utilizing commercial practices when practical.

Objective 4 - Fully operational services and systems at the start of health care delivery. Minimal disruption to beneficiaries and MTFs.

Objective 5 - Ready access to contractor maintained data to support the Department of Defenses (DoD) financial planning, health systems planning, medical resource management, clinical management, clinical research, and contract administration activities.

These Objectives are not unchangeable.  Potential sources may have more contemporary information on the proper objectives for achieving our vision and mission while clearly focusing on measurable, high quality clinical and administrative services achieved in the most cost efficient manner for the American taxpayer.  We are also very interested in the industrys thoughts concerning performance requirements. Requirements in this setting represent performance that must occur at or exceed specified performance standards and that achieves outcome based objectives identified in a contract.  Examples of the performance standards may be found in the TRICARE Operations Manual at www.tricare.mil.  TMA is very interested in the industrys assessment of the existing performance standards and suggestions for new, revised, and or completely changed performance standards.  Performance standards information is desired for the following areas of interest that are being included in the contracts. 

  1.  Networks  Access to network providers, location of networks (networks are required around military hospitals and clinics and Base Realignment and Closure Sites (BRAC).  Offerors are allowed to propose networks where cost-effective.  What does industry suggest in relation to networks?
  2.  Referral Management  TRICARE Prime enrollees currently require a referral from their primary care manager prior to seeing another provider (there are some exceptions for preventive and mental health care).  In lieu of obtaining a referral, Prime enrollees may use the point-of-service option and pay a $300 individual deductible and 50% cost share.  Referral management is also currently used to direct patients to MTFs who have the right of first refusal for any care referred by a civilian provider.  What are current practices in an HMO environment and how have these practices impacted cost?

  3.  MTF Coordination  Close coordination between our MTFs and MCSCs is currently critical as networks and referral management must continuously adjust to support the changes in MTF capability and capacity that occur daily as the result of war, contingency operations, national disasters, deployments, training, transfers, etc.  TMA is interested in discussing the impact MTF operations have on contracts and the extent to which this impact affects costs, network management, and industrys interest in submitting proposals on TRICARE contracts.

  4.  Medical Management.  We define medical management as contemporary practices in areas such as network management, utilization management, case management, care coordination, disease management, and the various additional terms and models for managing the clinical and social needs of the beneficiary to achieve the short and long term cost-effectiveness of the MHS while achieving the highest level of satisfaction among MHS beneficiaries.  What is the value of each of the named approaches and are there other opportunities to enhance the quality of care while ensuring the appropriate expenditure of tax dollars.

  5.  Claims Processing.  TRICARE anticipates processing 170 million claims across all contracts (managed care, pharmacy, TRICARE for Life, dental, etc.) next year.  How can TRICARE achieve efficiencies while complying with federal laws regarding the expenditure of Government dollars?

  6.  Customer Service.  TRICARE provides customer services via telephone, e-mail, web based materials, on-site service centers at all MTFs, and thousands of briefings annually.  How would a commercial concern approach customer service?  How is that level of service received by your commercial clients?  What percent of a premium is dedicated to customer service other than marketing?

  7.  Automated Data Processing.  TRICARE has a number of unique data processing requirements including Department of Defense mandated security procedures and certifications, interfaces with DEERS to determine eligibility on-line, processing enrollments through Government systems, and submitting payment records in support of claims processing activities.  Many of these requirements are not negotiable; however, we are interested in the impact of these requirements on costs and the level of interest in proposing on future contracts.

  8.  Management Services.  This is a broad category that includes staffing, quality management/quality improvement, reporting, responsiveness to change, and managing contractor operations to fulfill the Governments performance standards while achieving the Governments outcomes.  What should the Government require in terms of management services, how should they be measured, and how should the Government monitor performance?

  9.  Incentives.  What positive and negative incentives are used in the industry, if any, and how do they impact your operations and proposals. What incentives should be created that would help achieve the goals of TRICARE?

The Government is interested in any information potential sources would like to address in support of achieving high quality, cost effective delivery of health care services.  Please remember there are legislative limitations and recommendations conflicting with statutes may not be able to be implemented.  However, any of the administrative requirement changes which support a more efficient TRICARE Program may be acceptable for information presentation.  The Regulations, TRICARE Operations Manual, TRICARE Policy Manual, TRICARE Systems Manual, and TRICARE Reimbursement Manual are all requirements of the TRICARE Program and uniform benefit. These are available for review at www.tricare.mil and may provide insight to potential sources.

Period of performance for this effort is from date of modification thro ugh January 2008. This contract modification will be issued using other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, such that there is only one responsible source and nother other supplies or services will satisfy the CRP requ irements. Murtech, Inc. has demonstrated to the CRP that it meets all the CRP requirements as a Storage and Distribution Facility. It would take an unacceptable amount of time and requirement substantial duplication of costs to store, maintain, dispose, an d distribute the additional CRP products at another facility not on contract with San Antonio Scientific Support Limited. This is not a request for completitive proposals but parties purporting to have the requisite credentials to perform these services wi thout substantial duplication of cost or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements must furnish in writing, factual information that clearly supports and demonstrates that their facility is sufficiently able to store maintain, dispose of,  and distibute CRP products to both OCONUS and CONUS sites by close of business May 4, 2007. This information must be e-mailed to Leo Fratis at Leo.Fratis@us.army.mil or faxed to his attention at (301)519-5069. A determination not to compete this proposed action based on any responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Numbered Note 22.

(See 29 CFR 4.174) <br>                                                     
<br>
THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS as numbered): <br>       
<br>
1) Rates are applicable only under the appropriate occupational category. <br> 
<br> 
** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<br> 
If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: <br>
<br> 
The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. <br>
<br>
** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION **<br>
Under the policy and guidance contained in All Agency Memorandum No. 159, the Wage and Hour Division does not recognize, for section 4(c) purposes, prospective wage rates and fringe benefit provisions that are effective only upon such contingencies as "approval of Wage and Hour, issuance of a wage determination, incorporation of the wage determination in the contract, adjusting the contract price, etc." (The relevant CBA section) in the collective bargaining agreement between (the parties) contains contingency language that Wage and Hour does not recognize as reflecting "arm's length negotiation" under section 4(c) of the Act and 29 C.F.R. 5.11(a) of the regulations. This wage determination therefore reflects the actual CBA wage rates and fringe benefits paid under the predecessor contract. <br>         
<br>
Source of Occupational Title and Descriptions: <br>
<br> 
The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations," Fourth Edition, January 1993, as amended by the Third Supplement, dated March 1997, unless otherwise indicated. This publication may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, at 202-783-3238, or by writing to the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402. Copies of specific job descriptions may also be obtained from the appropriate contracting officer. <br>
<br>
REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)}       
Conformance Process: <br>
<br>                                    
The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract.    
{See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.                                             
The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: <br>                    
1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). <br>                                    
2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. <br>                                
3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). <br>          
4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.                                                              
5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. <br>                                                                       
6) The contractor informs the affected employees.            
Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. <br>                                                                            
When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination. <br>

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 

Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

Inverted Domestic Corporation.  A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held? 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a  Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

A fuel mechanic will then remove the barrel from the sling and transfer the propane from the 125 Gal. Pickle barrels to standard 500 Gallon propane tanks.  This process is repeated until all tanks are at maximum capacity. This is a high priority U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue system that must be kept operational at all times to protect property and lives.  

Requirement:  Contractor shall fuel the following attached Alaska sites with propane per schedule. Contractor shall provide up to 10% additional fuel to assure that all tanks are filled to the maximum allowable capacity of each tank.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for A Spray-On Foam Insulation Dispensing System.  This procurement is a total small business set-aside. The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Delivery to Marshall Space Flight Center/NASA Central Receiving, BLDG 4631, Saturn Rd.,MSFC, AL 35812 is required within six (6) weeks ARO.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9. The detailed description is below, see attachment for specifications and quantity: Spray on foam insulation (SOFI) is composed of two separate liquid components typically supplied in 55 gallon steel drums.  Component A is an isocyanate material while component B is a blend of additives in a polyol base.  Separately these materials are fairly stable liquids, however when mixed in the proper ratio an exothermic chemical reaction occurs creating a rigid cellular foam.  This foam is typically utilized for insulation purposes due to its low thermal conductivity properties. The purpose of the dispensing system is to transport the individual liquid chemical components from individual shipping containers, typically 55 gallon drums, thru a pumping system which amplifies the pressure and delivers a predetermined flow of individual component A and B materials, to the spray gun where the A and B components mix together and exit the gun in a spray.  The operator of the system determines the desired settings for the individual component temperatures, pressures, and the ratio of the components to provide a satisfactory foam product.  These properties are achieved by manipulation of controllers which are usually part of the dispensing system and proper selection of orifices contained in the spray gun. Offers for the items(s) described above are due by April 30, 2007 at 12:00 noon cst to Elizabeth Mudler/DFS and must include, solicitation number, FOB destination to this Center, proposed delivery schedule, discount/payment terms, warranty duration (if applicable), taxpayer identification number (TIN), identification of any special commercial terms, and be signed by an authorized company representative.

Vendors must provide the brand name Enterasys part numbers for the switches (CLINS 0001, 0002, 0003).  Following is the justification to limit sources to the brand name product:
DDC has installed local area networks; LANs, throughout its Distribution Depots across the globe supporting the DLA logistical mission to support the War Fighter. Each depot has its own network installed per IEEE 802.3, EIA/TIA, and DLA standards and policies comprised of a sole manufacturer network hardware configuration. 

This sole manufacturer network hardware configuration has enhanced our management capabilities of DDC funds by reducing the number of maintenance support contracts, decreasing the multiple vendor training requirements for site IT personnel, and eliminating the need for various ancillary IT equipment or software installations required to allow functionality between multi vendor equipment. 

The configuration of our network using equipment from a sole manufacturer strengthens network management abilities allowing the identification of specific data software tools used for local area/wide area network management oversight. This increases our effectiveness to maintain DDC networks that are functional, dependable and available in support of our mission. 

Enterasys network switching equipment is the hardware installed at the Distribution Depot located in DDSP New Cumberland, PA. This standardization was planned in part due to the network infrastructure configuration at the time of the DDC stand up. The use of Enterasys SecureStack C2 and C3 network switching platforms will enhance network capabilities using key features as: 

SecureStack C2:
	The extensive security features built into all SecureStack C2 switches make them an important part of Enterasys Secure Networks, and enable Secure Networks to be extended to the network edge. 
	A single stack density is now increased to an industry-leading 360 gigabit ports or 384 10/100 ports with 32 gigabit uplinks.
	Reliability and availability is assured with support for Closed Loop Stacking, redundant core connections, redundant power options and redundant stack management. 
	Maintain existing network hardware architecture enabling ease of integration into the current network management configuration.  

SecureStack C3: 
	The extensive security features built into all SecureStack C3 switches make them an important part of Enterasys Secure Networks, and enable Secure Networks to be extended to the network edge. 
	The SecureStack C3 delivers an industry leading 384 Gigabit ports in a single stack. 
	The C3 provides extensive security features and is an important part of extending Enterasys Secure Networks to the network edge. 
	The extensive Layer 2 and Layer 3 feature set includes optional support for IPv6. 

Vendors may propose a either brand name or equal product for the transceivers (CLINS 0003, 0004).  Salient characteristics for those products are listed below.  If proposing an or equal product, vendors must submit technical information that demonstrates the proposed product meets the required specifications.

To receive an award resulting from this solicitation, offerors MUST be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database IAW FAR 52.212-1(k) and DFARS 204.1104. Registration may be done on line at: www.ccr.gov.

Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activitys Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer).

Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel ( see DLA Directive 5145.1).

An itemized list shall be delivered with each shipment listing: date of order, itemized list of supplies, quantity ordered, q uantity delivered and unit of cost. The Vendor shall maintain a sanitary program which complies, at a minimum, with the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 21, part 110, to ensure sanitation and warehousing practices for food are monitored and evaluat ed in accordance with accepted industry standards.

That section provides, in pertinent part, that whoever knowingly converts to their use or the use of another, or without authority, sells, conveys, or disposes of any record of the United States or whoever receives the same with intent to convert it to their use or gain, knowing it to have been converted, shall be guilty of a crime punishable by a fine of up to $10,000, or imprisoned up to ten years, or both.
