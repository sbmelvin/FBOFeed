<DESC>The proposed contract action is for an acquisition for which DLA Distribution intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for Preventive and Remedial Maintenance of firefighting vehicles, auxiliary attachments, fire hoses, and breathing air compressor located at DLA Distribution Susquehanna, New Cumberland PA.
<p>The Period of Performance for the proposed contract action will consist of a Base Year and One (1) Option Year.</p>
<p>The firefighting vehicles to be maintained were manufactured by Kovatch Mobile Equipment (KME) and consist of a KME Response Truck; two (2) KME Pumper Trucks; and a KME Ladder Truck. Fire and Rescue Products, a division of W.W. Engine and Supply, is the only source that can provide Preventive and Remedial Maintenance for the firefighting vehicles because they are the KME factory-authorized distributor for the New Cumberland, PA area. In order to ensure that the performance, reliability and safety of these firefighting vehicles are not compromised, the contractor that performs Preventive and Remedial Maintenance must be a factory authorized distributor that employs factory trained service technicians who are technically familiar with the KME firefighting vehicles, and have unlimited access to obtain OEM replacement parts. KME has established this authorized distributor network to ensure replacement part compatibility and repair service integrity because the use of non-OEM replacement parts and non-OEM factory trained service technicians could be catastrophic in terms of equipment liability costs and personnel injury or death. Accordingly, the Government intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price/time-and-materials purchase order utilizing FAR Parts 12 and 13 to Fire and Rescue Products to provide Preventive and Remedial Maintenance of firefighting vehicles, auxiliary attachments, fire hoses, and breathing air compressor.</p>
<p>Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Only one (1) contract award will be made for this requirement. Contractors must have the capability to provide maintenance for all of the firefighting equipment listed above.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 811118 with a small business size standard of $7,000,000.00.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may respond by submitting qualifications/capabilities of the company to provide Preventive and Remedial Maintenance of firefighting vehicles, auxiliary attachments, fire hoses, and breathing air compressor by 4:00 PM EDT, FRIDAY, APRIL 1, 2011 to DLA Distribution, Acquisition Operations, J7-AB, J Avenue, Bldg 404, New Cumberland, PA 17070, Attn: Daniel Herring, Phone: 717-770-6030, FAX: 717-770-7591, e-mail: daniel.herring@dla.mil, or Joni Stephens, Phone: 717-770-5912, FAX: 717-770-5689, e-mail: joni.stephens@dla.mil for consideration by the agency. If no affirmative responses are received by 4:00 PM EDT, FRIDAY, APRIL 1, 2011 to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, a purchase order will be negotiated with and awarded to Fire and Rescue Products.</p>

<DESC>Introduction/Statement of Intent
This is to announce the continuation of the existing contract, DTFAWA-07-C-00028, with Black Box Network Solutions (Black Box). This procurement will be a two-year extension of the contract to supply the FAA with SONET Add-Drop Multiplexers (ADM), Remote Monitoring Systems (RMS) and other associated hardware and services.
Total Estimated Value and Period of Performance
The total estimated value of this two-year extension will be $1,750,381 increasing the value of the current contract ceiling from $7,700,000 to $9,450,381.  The current contract ends April 30, 2012 and the extension is for the period May 1, 2012 through April 30, 2014.
Authority
The authority for this single source extension is found in AMS policy clause 3.2.2.4 Single-Source Selection.
Reasons for Single-Source
An extension of the Black Box contract provides the FAA requirement for standardization of equipment in the National Air Space (NAS) as well as provides the ability to use the existing FAA Academy equipment training course.  The incumbent has demonstrated the capability to execute all FAA requirements for the contract (both technical and management).  They understand and facilitate the FAA quality review process and can accommodate the requirements for timely delivery of equipment orders.  It is imperative for the program office to have a vendor who can achieve this fast turnaround.  Black Box is the only known source who can satisfy the delivery requirements within the needed timeframe.  The program office has an immediate need for this equipment and a new procurement would take two to three years from award to deployment.
Questions
Any questions or clarifications on this extension should be directed to the FAA Contract Officer by e-mail to Dixie.harper@faa.gov, no later than the close of business March 31, 2011.

----------  Brand Name Justification and Approval Document   ----------
1.  Contracting Activity:  Fish & Wildlife ServiceDivision of Contracting & Grant ServicesSoutheast Region, Atlanta, GA(c/o) ES-Lafayette Field Office, LA
2.  Description of Action:     Open Mkt/Commercial Item    	     Requirement: Follow-on     Pricing: Firm-Fixed Price     Funds: 2011 43440 2984E4LB  /  PR # 43440-11-BG02	    Name of Intended Brand: (Lotek Model)  Iridium Track 3D (1.1Kg)  	3.  Description of Services/Supplies: (Lotek Model) Iridium Track 3D (1.1Kg) - Field Proven Iridium Satellite Collars with VHF Transmitters
4.  Reason for Brand Name Justification: 
     (a)  Only one brand/source is capable of meeting the need due to the unique or specialized nature of the requirement.  
     (b)  The new work/supply is a logical follow-on to an existing order/contract requirement.    
     (c)  Other: Brand name and model number(s) listed in solicitation is required due to component compatibility.  The particular brand name, products, and features described are essential to the Government's requirements so no substitutes are allowed for this request.
Additional Information:(i)  What harm will come to the Government if desired supplies/services are not provided?The Government will experience compatibility issues/problems, which would cause functional and reliability problems between differing brands.  This would directly and negatively affect the study, tracking, and welfare of wildlife and other related Government mission requirements.  
(ii)  Explain why other brand names will not satisfy the government's requirement?The Government will experience compatibility issues/problems, which would cause functional and reliability problems between differing brands.  In addition, to use other brands, additional expenses would be incurred to acquire additional items that are compatible with the non-brand name item, which is not in the Government's best interest.  The costs and time delays of implementing a non-compatible item outweigh the benefits of open competition.  If a non-compatible item was used, then existing brand name items would have to be purchased to compliment the non-compatible item.  In addition, the Government requires conformity among our various locations for interchangeable use and data collection.
5.  Market Survey:  Internet search and research.  Comparative analysis among similar brands.
6.  Actions to Increase Competition: The Government will continue to revisit the market to assess our options as technology advances.
7.  Other Supporting Facts/attachments: n/a
8.  What actions, if any, will be taken to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the brand name supply is made:  The Government will continue to revisit the market to assess our options as technology advances.
9.  Procurement History:Previous Contract or Purchase Order Number:N/APreviously competed: N/A	10.  Technical / Requirements Certification:  I certify that the support data under my cognizance which are included in this J&A are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  *Any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel that form a basis for the justification are certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements (end-user) personnel.

<DESC>MSC's T-AOE 6 Class vessels have an obsolete auxiliary boiler control system causing maintenance and operational difficulties. The V2M Boilers are 125-psi oil-fired, natural circulation, water tube auxiliary boilers. There are two V2M Boilers per ship that provide service steam for auxiliary use underway and when needed, in port. Both boilers have burner management, combustion control and feedwater control systems creating the current boiler control system (BCS). The ship's service steam load fluctuates with the equipment running, ship's location/season and is dependant mainly on the following systems: house/hotel loads, water heaters, fuel heaters, air ejectors for evaporators, and purifier heaters. When in a low load condition, the existing combustion control equipment is not capable of operating at ideal efficiency and additional equipment must be operated to increase load. <br /><br />Military Sealift Command has decided to replace the existing BCS with a modern Programmable Logic Control (PLC) type boiler control system. This system shall provide reliable control over the entire boiler operating range. <br />

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with TA Instruments of New Castle, Delaware for the purchase of an Isothermal Calorimeter under other than full and open competition.<br />&nbsp;<br />NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
<p>(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in -</p>
<p>(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.<br /><br />(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)<br /><br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: The TA Instruments isothermal calorimeter will be used in conjunction with an existing calorimeter recently purchased by NIST. In order to combine data, the calorimeter must be 100% compatible with the existing TA Instruments calorimeter currently at NIST. Deviations away from the TA Instruments isothermal calorimeter would cause needless replication of key equipment, compatibility issues and would result in significant duplication of cost to NIST in both hardware and man-hours. TA Instruments is the sole manufacturer and distributor of this system. As a result, TA Instruments is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on March 31, 2011. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to joshua.holliday@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard in $7M.<br />&nbsp;<br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve months from date of award.</p>
<p>Although there is clear evidence that self-reported discrimination is associated with worse health outcomes, there is no single valid and reliable instrument to measure racial/ethnic discrimination among multiethnic and multilingual groups. To addresses this need, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) initiated development of the California Health Interview Survey Discrimination Module, or CHIS-DM, a multi-year transdisciplinary research initiative to develop a state-of-the-science self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination module (Shariff-Marco et al, Ethnicity &amp; Disease 2009).</p>
<p>The 2007 data are currently being analyzed for publication by the large CHIS-DM Research Team; these manuscripts need to be completed and submitted. In addition, the 2009 data need to be weighted and imputed, similar to 2007 data. The purpose of the current contract is to coordinate analyses of the 2007 CHIS-DM, to prepare the 2009 CHIS-DM data for analysis, to lead the meetings needed to move this project forward, and to enable the completion of two research manuscripts</p>
<p>The Cancer Prevention Institute of California (CPIC) is uniquely qualified to carry out the terms of this contract. Staff at the CPIC have a very strong working knowledge of the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) and were integral in developing the Discrimination Module from the ground up, which make the CPIC a unique resource for conducting this work.</p>
<p>NCI tested two versions of the survey on a large sample of adult respondents to CHIS 2007 in English, led the process of imputation and weighting the data and is now coordinating the analysis of these data. NCI tested the Discrimination Module on the CHIS 2009 in multiple languages, and these data must be imputed and weighted similarly to the CHIS 2007 data in order to maintain continuity in results. CPIC staff have extensive skills derived from leading the imputation and weighting of the 2007 CHIS DM data make CPIC uniquely skilled to lead this process for the 2009 data. CPIC is uniquely qualified to carry out the terms of this contract because of because of the knowledge that their staff have in this area of research and with this project specifically.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if&nbsp;the interested party&nbsp;can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on March 31, 2011. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax). An original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Ward, Contract Specialist, at wardmr@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.

<SUBJECT>cAMP HiRange Assay Kits

<CONTACT>Dorothy Maxwell, Phone 301-435-0352, Fax 301-480-3345, Email maxwelld@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to CisBio US, Inc.,  135 South Road, Bedford, Massachusetts 01730-2204 to procure cAMP HiRange Kits.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation’s leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve people’s health and save lives.  The mission of the NCGC is to apply the tools of small molecule screening and discovery to the development of chemical probe research tools, for use in the study of protein and cell functions, and biological processes relevant to physiology and disease. NCGC will optimize biochemical, cellular and model organism-based assays submitted by the biomedical research community; perform automated high-throughput screening (HTS); and perform chemistry optimization on confirmed hits to produce chemical probes for dissemination to the research community. These reagents allow the detection of cAMP in a homogenous assay format, which is critical to high throughput screening (HTS). The quantities being purchased here are urgently requested and will be used for large collection robotic screen.

This requested cAMP HiRange kit is designed to address either the use of cell-based or cellular membranes-assays in GPCR activation and Adenylate Cyclase activity screening. The cAMP HiRange assay is highly robust and provides quality results while eliminating the costly need for a continuous supply of living cells. HTRF® (homogeneous time resolved fluorescence) is a technology based on TR-FRET, a combination of FRET chemistry and the use of fluorophores with long emission half-lives. While HTRF is based on TR-FRET chemistry it has many properties that separate it from other TR-FRET products. These include the use of Europium and Terbium cryptate chemistries. The lanthanides have a long life and their complexing to macrocycles to form cryptates allows increased stability. Finally, the use of a patented radiometric measurement enables correction for quenching and sample interferences.

This requested kit is one of three ready-to-use assays manufactured by CisBio for measuring cAMP using HTRF® technology. Each kit is optimized for detecting a specific range of cAMP concentrations that allows us the ability to fine tuning our assay sensitivity. These kits enable high quality, cell-based assay screening in 96-, 384- or 1536-well formats. The primary assay was developed and optimized using this reagent for the Gnas1 inhibitor project at the NCGC, and has been miniaturized into the 1536-well plate format for high throughput screening. A requirement of this assay is that the detection reagents are highly specific to cAMP and can detect the presence of cAMP in a homogenous format. We plan to use this assay in a high throughput screen aimed at finding small molecule compounds that will inhibit activating mutations of the Gnas1 protein. This project is an effort to develop drugs that might attenuate the Gs signaling pathway in treatment of McCune Albright Syndrome. To this extent, we will measure the intracellular level of cAMP in a cell line that carries the Gnas1 activating mutation.

We must use the same variables in our assays to achieve the desired outcomes and to maintain the integrity and compatibility of the project studies. All of the earlier assay optimization done by our group was performed with the cAMP HighRange kits. Additionally, the screening needs to be done with the same reagents in order to yield comparable and readily interpretable results. A switch to a different detection reagent would necessitate re-optimizing the assay. This would entail unacceptable substantial time delays and enormous additional costs.

This is a small business set-aside. Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 339999, All Other Miscellaneous Manufacturing, with size standard of 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001).and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-48 (January 31, 2011). 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by March 22, 2011, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.

Inquires to this announcement,  referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2011-135-DLM, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition,   COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Dorothy Maxwell.  Response may be submitted electronically to maxwelld@mail.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted.  Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Conservation Engineering Project requires a Bering Sea factory processor vessel that uses a twin-trawl system to catch groundfish in support of trawl gear research. <br />
<p>The Government requires to charter a commercial fishing vessel that can provide paired catches from matched full-scale bottom trawls operated simultaneously, a method known as twin-trawling. The scientific design is to allow comparisons of modifications made to one of the trawls - comparing such catches measures the quantitative effects of those trawl modifications on catch rates of groundfish. Such comparisons are an essential part of studies of fishing gear modifications to reduce bycatch, unobserved mortality or the effects of trawling on seafloor ecosystems.</p>
<p>To accomplish this work, the vendor's vessel must be equipped with two identical commercial-scale trawl systems (including bridles and sweeps) and all equipment necessary (three main trawl winches, two doors and a central clump) to tow both trawls on adjacent, simultaneous paths (twin trawling). Key vessel personnel must be experienced at using this method of fishing on this vessel to capture commercial quantities of groundfish in Alaska waters.</p>
<p>Research will take place for up to 16 days between May 15th and October 15th, 2011, with the option for three additional one-year option periods with the actual survey period occurring on or about May 15 through October 15 each year.</p>
<p>Contractor must be able to provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, transportation, fuel and services necessary to perform these services.</p>
<p>Field evaluations require fishing conditions representative of those of the commercial groundfish fishery, these tests require commercial-scale catches of groundfish to be captured and sampled during this charter. Capturing sufficient quantities of groundfish to represent commercial operations would make it wasteful to merely eject such fish back to the sea. The project will be done under a contract with no cost to the Government, the vessel being compensated by sale of the catch produced during the research. In addition to all facilities necessary to handle, sort and process large catches (2 - 12 tons) of mixed groundfish, the vessel must have motion-compensated flow scales installed to weigh the whole catch as it enters the sorting area and to weigh the catch of each species separately after sorting.</p>
<p>Minimum overall vessel length required is 150 feet. Minimum continuous horsepower output from main engine, 1,000hp. Minimum cruising speed of 10 knots.</p>
<p><br />The proposed contract is unrestricted and open to all business concerns. The NAICS code for this procurement is 483114 and the size standard is 500 employees. All vendors wishing to do business with the Government are required to be registered in CCR and ORCA using this NAICS code. *** Any contract resulting from this procurement will be awarded at no cost to the Government. Contractor will be compensated for charter costs through sale of fish caught during study. *** Solicitation documents will be made available for download on or about April 1, 2011 at http://www.fbo.gov/.

<DESC>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT for the sole source procurement of the extension of services of the existing contract with LCLC Inc. who is providing a Naval Special Warfare Family Resiliency Program for the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery to LCLC, Inc.  The contracting activity is Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office, 700 Robbins Avenue, Building 2B, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5083.   
The services include an extension of the scope of work included in the existing effort (retreat event) along with an extension of the timeline of the contract from 31 May 2011 to 31 Aug 2011.  The extension will allow for the facilitation of a long-term competitive follow-on contract to be implemented.
 The additional work is within the scope of the existing contract requirements, and can only be provided by LCLC, Inc.  Competition of the requirement and award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of effort, and would result in disjointed management and provision of the established NSW Family Resiliency program.  In addition, given the shift in the timeline of deliverables to a June 2011 timeframe, it is impractical for another Contractor to be able to perform the services in the required timeframe.   

Challengers may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by sending challenges to Cathy Kelly at cathy.kelly@navy.mil. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, all challenges to this sole source determination received within one day after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.
 Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

This set consists of Spherical Bearing Installation and Removal Tool and Retaining Ring Installation and Removal Tool, used for maintenance of the Wing Stow System on CV/MV 22 aircraft.
<p>The Government intends to procure the above items under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1. The spherical bearing for the Wing Stow System (WSS) requires removal and installation while on the V-22 aircraft. Thus issues such as access to the bearing location and wing thickness/curvature, as well as tight tolerances, are critical to the design of the maintenance set. Improper installation or removal can result in damage to the WSS resulting in downing aircraft for an extended period of time. Boeing is the only source with information on the aircraft environment that can design this maintenance set to work correctly within the time frame required for fleet use.</p>

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research, Warfighter Protection and Applications Division of the<br />Warfighter Performance Department (Code 342) is soliciting white papers (preproposals)<br />and proposals in the following topic areas within the NIHL Program.<br />Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus are currently the largest areas of<br />disability compensation by the Veterans Administration (VA) and both greatly affect our<br />service members. Hearing deficits have a deleterious impact on operational readiness and<br />service member quality of life. The field of hearing preservation and restoration covers a<br />broad area of research topics. Research in the following areas is required.<br />1. Capability to preserve and restore hearing.<br />a. Studies of hair cell regeneration. This may include stimulation of<br />endogenous cells for replacement of lost cells or transplantation of stem<br />and/or progenitor cells. Endogenous stimulation may include genetic,<br />neurotrophic, pharmacologic, or other approaches. Stem cell research may<br />include adult or embryonic stem cells. (Note: If the offeror anticipates that<br />the use of embryonic stem cells may be needed to perform the proposed<br />research, it must provide adequate information to demonstrate compliance<br />[or a plan of compliance] with applicable executive orders, statutes,<br />regulations, and other guidance on use of pluripotent stem cells. This is<br />expected to include information about how the stem cells to be used in the<br />proposed research were derived.)<br />b. Prevention and/or treatment of hair cell loss. This may include<br />pharmacologic approaches, prevention of apoptosis, manipulation of<br />signaling systems, enzyme and/or antioxidant treatment/mimicry, etc., and<br />the development of novel cochlear implant technology.<br />2. Capability to identify individual/population susceptibility to noise-induced<br />hearing loss/tinnitus<br />a. Studies on genetics/biomarkers. This may include assessing the variations<br />in DNA sequencing to elucidate genotype single nucleotide<br />polymorphisms that are correlated to NIHL and/or tinnitus, studies on<br />inheritable traits as risk factors, or other biomarker/biometric approaches.<br />b. Development and validation of assessment tools. This may include studies<br />on the use of otoacoustic emissions, pre-existing hearing loss, or other<br />reliable methods/factors that can rapidly assess susceptibility.<br />3. Development of tools and methodologies that rapidly assess changes in hearing<br />thresholds and recommend the most effective individual mitigation/treatment<br />strategies.<br />4. Advanced training tools for the audiologist and service member that demonstrate<br />hearing loss and tinnitus, and that promote the correct use of hearing protection.<br />5. Surgical and nonsurgical approaches to the treatment of combat-related middle<br />and inner ear trauma, including reconstruction, replacement, or augmentation of<br />hearing structures.<br />6. Basic research elucidating the etiology of tinnitus.<br />7. Development of prototype technologies or specifications for prototype<br />development to monitor/reduce individual noise exposure, either through<br />passive/electronic hearing devices or noise exposure reduction.<br />

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Rose Tallant, Phone 215-728-7524, Email rtallant@nish.org
<DESC>On behalf of the AbilityOne Program, NISH, a designated central nonprofit agency, is pursuing potential partnerships with U.S. commercial manufacturers of Roll Mix and Sweet Roll Mix for the purpose of providing employment for people who are blind or severely disabled. If successful, the result will be a co-brand agreement between the manufacturer and the AbilityOne Program, and its registered brands. The ultimate expectation is that the co-branded product will be placed on the AbilityOne Procurement List (PL).
<p>The Roll Mix and Sweet Roll Mix must meet and/or exceed FAR and other Federal Government published standards, Executive Orders and Federal Agency requirements.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the following criteria must be met:</p>
<p>1. Possession of a nationally known brand name that can be demonstrated to have significant appeal through evidence of substantial sales. <br />2. This project represents a potential new addition to the Procurement List (PL). This will be a Co-Branding Opportunity pending Committee approval. The Transylvania Vocational Services (TVS) located in Brevard, North Carolina, will Co-Brand with a nationally recognized supplier of Roll Mix that currently supplies Roll Mix and Sweet Roll Mix to the U.S. Military through the DLA Prime Vendor Program. TVS will blend the mix according to the Co-Branding Partners proprietary blend or receive the blended mix in super sacks or totes from the Co-Branding Partner. Preference will be given to the Co-Branding Partner that allows TVS to blend mixes in their plant.

The BAA and NRA can beaccessed at: http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/solicitations.do?method=open&stack=push.  Participation in this partnering synopsis is open to all categories of U.S. and non-U.S.organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit institutions,the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as NASA Centers and other U.S. GovernmentAgencies.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Other MinorityUniversities (OMUs), small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), veteran-owned smallbusinesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBzone small businesses,and women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) are encouraged to apply.  Participation bynon-U.S. organizations is welcome but subject to NASAs policy of no exchange of funds,in which each government supports its own national participants and associated costs.Under the Unique and Innovative Space Technology BAA, the Game Changing TechnologyDivision (GCT), within NASAs Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) is solicitingexecutive summaries, white papers, and proposals for research and development (R&D) fortechnology that is innovative and unique and promises to enable revolutionary(game-changing) improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of our countrys spacecapability. Novel (unique) capabilities are sought in any of the NASA Space TechnologyGrand Challenges or the NASA draft Space Technology Roadmaps.  The Space Technology GrandChallenges can be found at:http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/strategic_integration/grand_challenges_detail.html.The Space Technology Roadmap (Draft) can be found at:http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/roadmaps/index.html. Under the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC), the NRA solicits multiple studies,each of which will investigate an architecture, mission, or system concept that has thepotential to change the possible in aeronautics or space. NASA Innovative AdvancedConcepts (NIAC) is also part of the Office of Chief Technologist (OCT). Concepts proposedfor NIAC Phase I studies must be innovative and visionary, technically substantiated, andvery early in development (10+ years out; Technology Readiness Level 1, 2, or early 3).Focused technology maturation and incremental improvement are explicitly not of interestin this program. In response to the NASA Research Announcement (NRA) NNH11ZUA001N, NASA InnovativeAdvanced Concepts (NIAC) and Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) NNH11ZUA001K, Unique andInnovative Space Technology, partners are sought for efforts focused on developing andvalidating active electrostatic radiation shielding for protecting astronauts and habitatin long duration human space missions.	Current conventional radiation protectionstrategy based on materials shielding alone, referred to as passive radiation shielding,is maturing (has been worked on for about three decades) and any progress using thematerials radiation shielding would only be evolutionary (incremental) at best.  Theoverall situation is further augmented by the nonexistence of in vivo or in vitro data orstudies about continuous long duration tissues exposure to a radiation and concomitantbiological uncertainties. Material shielding would have only limited or no potential foravoiding continuous exposure to radiation. In addition, current material shielding alonefor radiation protection for long duration/deep space safe human space missions isprohibitive due to pay load and cost penalties and is not a viable option.Out-of-the-box revolutionary technologies, while taking full advantage of advances inthe state-of-the-art evolutionary material shielding are sought. Active radiationshielding has a tremendous benefit of stopping and diverting space radiation from thespacecraft. Primary candidates for active shielding include but are not limited to:confined and unconfined magnetic fields requiring super-conducting magnets, plasmashields, and electrostatic shields. Recently, a journal publication (Adv. Space Res. 42(2008) 1043) made a critical analysis and demonstrated why previous approaches of usingelectrostatic and magnetic radiation shielding were not feasible. Further it clearlyestablished the feasibility proof-of-concept of electrostatic active shielding using thenovel approach of quadruple configuration. The biggest advantage of active electrostaticradiation shielding is that by preventing ions from hitting the spacecraft, the unknownharmful biological effects of continuous long duration exposure to  space radiation issignificantly reduced (~ 70 %) for galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and for solar particleevents (SPE), of great concern for radiation exposure,	it is practically eliminated.  Itis believed that the best strategy for radiation protection and shielding for longduration human missions is to use electrostatic active radiation shielding while, inconcert, taking the full advantage of the state-of-the-art evolutionary passive(material) shielding technologies for the much reduced and weaken radiation that mayescape and hit the spacecraft. In particular, NASA LaRC is seeking potential partners having demonstrated experience andexpertise in; 1) modeling and simulation (physics and electricity and magnetismbackground is desired), 2) assessments of radiation exposure dose, 3) fabrication ofexpandable structures for space needs, and 4) working with charged ions and electronsaccelerators.  NASAs intended applications include but are not limited to radiationprotection and shielding, radiation dose exposures, sensors, medical applications. Potential partners are requested to indicate which specific opportunity they areinterested in partnering with NASA LaRC, the NIAC NRA or the Unique and Innovative SpaceTechnology BAATeaming with providers of and leveraging emerging technologies, such as current andrecent Small Business Innovative Research awards(http://sbir.gsfc.nasa.fov/SBIR/awards.htm), is of special interest.If selected through this synopsis, it is expected that the selected partner(s) will workwith NASA LaRC scientists and engineers to jointly develop the proposal.  If the proposalis selected, NASA LaRC anticipates issuing contracts or other agreements to the selectedpartner(s) for performance of the proposed tasks. The goals of the partnerships are to;1) develop and optimize electrostatic active radiation shielding configuration(s) andmake simulation investigations, 2) assess radiation exposure for the configuration(s), 3)fabricate expandable structures, and 4) perform laboratory validation and tests of anexpandable structure for its effectiveness for electrons and positively charged ions.  This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts orother agreements, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for theinformation solicited.	It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at nocost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules, andcost estimates. Partner selections will be made by LaRC based on the listed criteria in the followingorder of importance:(1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability, key personnelavailability, and demonstration of work on any of the following: development of modelsand simulations, assessment of radiation doses exposures, fabrication of expandablestructures of space needs, working with charged particles (electrons and/or ions)accelerator laboratories and proficiency in analysis. This criterion evaluates theproposers relevant recent experience, past performance in similar developmentactivities, technical capability to perform the development, and key personnel availableto support the development.  Substantive evidence of successful participation in similardevelopments should be included.(2) Cost and schedule control.	This criterion evaluates the proposers ability tocontrol both cost and schedule.  The proposer should provide evidence of successfullycontrolling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence ofmanagement processes in this area.(3) Facilities.

National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation and Timing Office Outreach Support
Purpose: Provide administrative and document preparation support to the National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation and Timing Coordination Office (NCO) in achieving its strategy of stabilizing funding for the Global Positioning System (GPS), its modernization efforts, and its augmentations against budget fluctuations and program instabilities, within the overall resource and policy guidance provided by the President.
Background.: The President authorized a national policy on December 8,2004 that establishes guidance and implementation actions for space-based positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) programs, augmentations, and activities for U.S. national and homeland security, civil. scientific, and commercial purposes. It also established the National Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) Executive Committee (EXCOM), comprised of six Federal departments and agencies. to serve as the overarching decision-making body responsible for fulfilling this policy. The Executive Committee is co-chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Deputy Secretary of Transportation, to reflect its dual civil-military role.  The policy also created the NCO to serve as the Secretariat for the Executive Committee and to perform those functions delegated by the Executive Committee. The NCO's mission is to ensure transparency into PNT programs, policies, budgets and activities that might affect mutual interests or interagency dependencies. Specifically, a function of the NCO is to advise and coordinate interdepartmental resource allocation for the GPS and its augmentations.  In order to more effectively integrate and communicate the Administration's PNT resource priorities to the Congress and American public, the EXCOM has directed the NCO to embark on an outreach program ensure the resource allocation decisions made by the legislative branch are fully informed by the complete range of PNT-related programs and applications. Because PNT issues cut across traditional Committee boundaries and focus areas, the NCO intends to build a comprehensive outreach strategy that will communicate the broad range of PNT plans and programs, and ensure they are implemented within the overall resource and policy guidance provided by the President.
Scope: This effort is focused on providing administrative assistance to the NCO with building and implementing an outreach plan in accordance with the US government space-based PNT goals and objectives. 
Subtasks:  The following subtasks are anticipated under task 4.4:
"Assist the NCO in U.S. government interagency meetings with clearance level up to TOP SECRET SCI."Assist the NCO in the development of talking points to convey complex PNT issues."Assist the NCO in the development of a comprehensive engagement strategy, including major milestones and a tentative schedule."Assist in interagency coordination of the talking points and engagement strategy."Define measures of effectiveness and track progress in completion of the outreach objectives."Plan and prepare engagement events called for in the engagement strategy to include development of printed materials, preparation of invitations, coordination of schedules, ordering and ensuring delivery of necessary materials, and other preparation tasks as required by the NCO."Facilitate engagement events to include: checking attendance, checking clearances, seating, ensuring audiovisual support, note-taking, minutes, and other tasks as required by the NCO."Facilitate after-action report and/or "lessons learned" to continuously improve the engagement strategy."Update talking points and other materials as necessary.
Deliverables:  The following deliverables are anticipated under this task.
"Written set of talking points suitable for interagency coordination of the intended message themes with which the NCO will engage the legislative branch."Printed materials suitable for "take-aways" that summarize the talking points."A written engagement strategy appropriate for inclusion in the NCO's annual National 5-Year Plan For Space-Based Positioning, Navigation and Timing."Written list of measures of effectiveness for the NCO's Congressional Outreach program.Security Clearance:  This task requires a Security Clearance level of TOP SECRET SCI.Travel: It is anticipated that one year worth of long distance travel under this task will include one international trip and up to three long-distance trips within the U.S. In addition, local travel and parking to attend meetings.
"International: One week-long trip to a GNSS-related venue such as, for example, the International Committee for GNSS (ICG). 
"Domestic:  Up to three trips including, for example: (1) attending the Institute of Navigation Global Navigation Satellite System (ION GNSS) conference; (2) participating in student regional conferences of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics; and (3) GPS outreach at events organized by U.S. museums or organizations.

<p>Background: The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) seeks a clinical trial coordinating center to coordinate and monitor a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial to assess the effects of folic acid and zinc sulfate supplementation on semen quality and fertility treatment outcomes among males of couples seeking fertility treatment. The proposed research study aims to increase the current understanding of the effects of folic acid and zinc sulfate supplementation on semen quality and fertility treatment outcomes, as well as the capacity of semen parameters to predict outcomes of fertility treatment. First, we want to investigate the effect of folic acid and zinc sulfate supplementation on semen quality parameters, including (but not limited to) concentration, motility, morphology, and sperm DNA fragmentation. Second, as the effects of folic acid and zinc sulfate supplementation are expected to improve not only semen quality, but also outcomes of fertility treatment, we want to investigate the effects of supplementation on fertilization rates, embryo quality, implantation, and clinical pregnancy. Lastly, we want to determine the predictive value of semen quality parameters and DNA integrity to predict fertilization, embryo quality, and clinical pregnancy. The contractor should be capable of managing and monitoring the proposed research study and provide oversight and quality control for recruitment and data collection. It is anticipated that any resultant contract(s) will be a cost reimbursement contract with options.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:<br />The proposed acquisition will involve the following types of activities:</p>
<p>1. Serve as the trial coordinating center for management and monitoring of a randomized clinical trial of folic acid and zinc sulfate supplementation among men of couples undergoing fertility treatment.<br />2. Serve as a clinical site or subcontract with clinical sites with large patient volumes of couples undergoing fertility treatment.<br />3. Procure folic acid and zinc sulfate and placebo medications for randomization.<br />4. Oversee recruitment and randomization of men of couples undergoing fertility treatment.<br />5. Handling and shipment of biospecimens for laboratory analysis and storage (e.g., semen, blood, urine).<br />6. Conduct (or subcontract for) the following assays that are anticipated: semen analysis, DNA fragmentation, hCG, serum folate test, anti-mullerian hormone, Inhibin B, estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone. <br />7. Serve as the coordinating center for developing procedures and instruments used in conducting the survey/study/clinical trial and analyzing data.<br />8. Coordinate clearance procedures such as Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, and maintain regular reporting as required by these organizations.<br />9. Conduct the survey/study using techniques such as paper and pencil, internet-based, personal interviews, telephone interviews, mail or Internet questionnaires, and/or abstracting data from existing sources. For some studies, physical measurement and the collection and analysis of biological specimens may be necessary. <br />10. Oversight of quality control for medication and biospecimen storage and analysis.<br />11. Assure protection of human subjects and confidentiality of information.</p>

<DESC>****NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) with the Utah Department of Technology Services for routine and emergency maintenance on NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) UHF, transmitters and microwave services throughout the State of Utah. <br />****The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) continued need for routine and emergency maintenance of the NOAA Weather Radio (NWR). NOAA has the continued need for vault, and tower space, along with the continued need for microwave service. This need is to ensure the highest possible system availability, within existing resources, is provided to the users. Continuous weather broadcast in all areas are tailored to weather information needs of people within the listening area. During severe weather, national disaster or nuclear attack, the National Weather Service, (NWS) forecaster, or designated state agencies, can interrupt the routing weather broadcast and substitute with the special warning messages. Each of the sites must have qualified licensed radio technicians in or near the areas that are trained on National Weather Service (NWS), NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) and Microwave Services. The vaults are owned, run and controlled by the State of Utah. The State of Utah owns the tools and general equipment and restricts access. Period of Performance will be April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012.<br />***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the space and service as described that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.<br />

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY</strong> - Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.<br />The Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting information, on behalf of the Protected Resources Division of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for research equipment necessary to continue monitoring loggerhead sea turtle behavior in the Mid-Atlantic region and also into the larger Northwest Atlantic Ocean.
<p>BACKGROUND<br />NOAA Fisheries Service is dedicated to protecting and preserving our nation's living marine resources and their habitat through scientific research, management and enforcement. NOAA NEFSC scientists research sea turtles to support the conservation and recovery of threatened and endangered sea turtle species by:</p>
<p>&bull; conducting population assessments<br />&bull; researching stock structure (age and genetics)<br />&bull; assessing sea turtle mortality, strandings, and unusual events<br />&bull; revising stock assessment reports for populations of sea turtles in the western North Atlantic Ocean<br />&bull; participating in research to reduce the bycatch of sea turtles<br />&bull; conducting in-water studies to evaluate population trends and habitat requirements<br />&bull; participating in technology transfer of successful bycatch reduction measures</p>
<p>NEFSC sea turtle scientists collaborate with other Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) and NOAA staff, academic colleagues, and contractors. NEFSC scientists provide information and analytical results on species status and threats to the NMFS for the effective management of marine turtles. The information is critical for evaluating the appropriate conservation measures, as required under the Endangered Species Act.<br />NEFSC scientists also contribute to the proceedings of the Annual Sea Turtle Symposia. NEFSC scientists also take part in implementing the NMFS Atlantic &amp; Gulf of Mexico Sea Turtle Strategy that is aimed at addressing the incidental capture of turtles in commercial and recreational fisheries along the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION <br />The Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (AMAPPS) project is part of a large, multi-agency initiative to provide a comprehensive assessment of marine mammal, marine turtle, and seabird abundance and spatial distribution in U.S. waters of the western North Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>The goal of this initiative is to develop models and associated tools to provide seasonal, spatially-explicit density estimates of marine mammals, sea turtles, and seabirds in the western north Atlantic. Data will be collected on the seasonal distribution and abundance of these taxa using direct aerial and shipboard surveys conducted by scientists from the National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Concurrently, NOAA is also conducting telemetry studies, passive acoustic monitoring, and developing alternative survey methodologies. These data will be used to develop corrections for availability bias in the abundance survey data and collect additional data on habitat use and life history, residence time, and frequency of use. Data collection for this study will occur over multiple years.</p>
<p>As part of the AMAPPS project, 14 satellite tags were deployed on immature loggerhead sea turtles captured in offshore Mid-Atlantic waters. The US Mid-Atlantic region is an important foraging ground for loggerhead sea turtles, but due to complications involved with locating and capturing these immature turtles on their offshore foraging grounds, relatively little is known about the large, immature turtles that occupy the neritic offshore Mid-Atlantic region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS<br />To accomplish NMFS science objectives, the Protected Species Branch of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) intends to purchase 15 satellite tags for research starting May 30, 2010.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide research equipment necessary to continue monitoring migrating loggerhead turtles in offshore Mid-Atlantic waters. The Contractor shall provide satellite transmitters with the following features:</p>
<p>&bull; Suitable for sea turtles<br />&bull; Demonstrated ability to transmit location and depth information for greater than 9 months while on wild loggerhead turtles in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic shelf waters and offshore<br />&bull; Less than 400 grams and smaller than 11cm x 8cm x 5cm<br />&bull; Have antennae durable enough to last over a year (on large juvenile sea turtles) <br />&bull; Capable of transmitting an unbiased sample of detailed individual dive records with individual dive profiles described by at least six (depth/time) points: the start of the dive, the end of the dive, and at least four non-random inflection points, one of which must be the maximum depth of the dive. <br />&bull; Flexible enough to allow GPS integration for a selected portion of the tag deployment. <br />&bull; Ability to obtain and transmit temperature measurements accurate to 0.1&ordm;C or better and depth measurements with 0.5m resolution or finer. <br />&bull; Tags must have an Advanced Research and Global Observation Satellite (ARGOS) certified transmitter. <br />&bull; Tags must have a transmission frequency of (401.650 MHz &plusmn; 30 kHz).</p>
<p>Data retrieved from the tags must have the following characteristics:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide an unbiased estimate of average dive duration (in addition to percent of time spent diving) and average surface duration (in addition to percent of time spent at/near surface) to use to "correct" aerial survey data for eventual abundance estimates.<br />&bull; Provide an estimate of the percent of the time turtles are at or near the surface. <br />&bull; Provide an estimate of the percent of the time turtles are on the bottom. <br />&bull; Prioritize the transmission of information collected while turtles are in the mid-Atlantic region (likely during the first 4 months of deployment).<br />&bull; Be compatible with our existing data archival and analysis procedures.</p>
<p>This equipment will be required to work with the existing infrastructure of equipment and software systems as part of an integrated monitoring system. This is a joint project between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) and Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC), the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOE; formerly the Minerals Management Service), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the U.S. Navy, and the sea scallop industry through their research set aside program. In addition, this telemetry work is being conducted in cooperation with the Coonamessett Farm Foundation with the assistance of Viking Village Fisheries and the F/V Kathy Ann.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLES<br />The Contractor shall provide equipment comparable to the following list of equipment:</p>
<p>15 satellite tags which match the above requirements. <br />Delivery to be on or before May 27, 2011</p>
<p>SHIP TO:<br />NOAA Fisheries<br />Protected Species Branch<br />166 Water Street<br />Woods Hole, MA 02540</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct market research which will be used to formulate an acquisition strategy to support adhoc Motor Transport Licensing Verification Services for the Training and Education Command (TECOM).  The Regional Contracting Office-National Capital Region (RCO-NCR) is requesting responses from all concerns.  The qualifying code for this effort is NAICS 561611. 

The Motor Transport Instruction Company, Marine Corps Detachment, Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri is required by DoD 4500.36R, TM 11240-15/3F, and MCO 11240.66D (Motor Vehicle Licensing Manual) to conduct Motor Vehicle Record Checks on all applicants for United States Government Motor Vehicle Operators Licenses.
  Historically, the method was to request this check through the National Drivers' Registry (NDR), which is done at little to no cost to the Marine Corps.  After September 11th 2001, NDR request volume increased steeply and turnaround time was inordinateâ€”weeks and months.  The risk, while waiting for NDR response, was that the school might receive negative results on students who were already weeks into their training, or that students could not graduate due to pending records checks.  Marines with serious issues in their driving record must be reclassified to a new Military Occupational Specialty (MOS). In addition, verification checks are required every time the Marine Force (MARFOR) upgrades a Marineâ€™s license (i.e.
 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) to Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) to Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) , etc).  The solution is to obtain contractor support for  verification checks including incidental licenses, upgrades, and renewals as an alternative in meeting required verifications. 

Objectives for this support include:  (1) A capability to  provide the results of a Motor Vehicle Records checks for approximately 60 students within 24 hours to Motor Transport Instruction Company, Fort Leonard Wood, MO for the purpose of driver qualification with an annual estimated throughput of 2,184 per year.  (2) Capability to meet requirements of 49 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR), paragraph 391.23 on an as needed basis.
  (3) Capability to provide an inquiry into a driverâ€™s driving record during the preceding three (3) years to the appropriate agency of every state in which the driver held a motor vehicle operatorâ€™s license or permit during those three (3) years.  (4) Capability to accommodate Operating Force (OPFORs) requirement to obtain Motor Vehicle Record Checks, within 24 hours of notification in the event the standard National Driver Registry (NDR) process becomes backlogged.
 
Responses to this RFI shall not exceed ten (10) pages, including cover letter and contact information.  Subject response must contain:  (1) Capability statement sufficient to demonstrate performance directly related to the objectives and qualifications in the above areas; (2) copy of required certifications, or status of certification, if pending approval; (3) Notations of time to complete previous, similar efforts and a description of any quality processes applied; (4)Link to the respondentâ€™s General Services Administration (GSA) schedule and/or Seaport-e IDIQ, or attached file of same, if applicable; (5) Commercial labor categories and rates used by respondents for similar services; (4) Citation of any current or past customers (i.e., within the past two (2) years) to include contract number, point of contact telephone number or e-mail address; and (6) other material relevant to establishing core competencies of the firm.
 

Response is due by 2:00 PM EST on Wednesday, 30 March 2011.  Please submit e-mail responses to Carol Neely at e-mail address carol.neely@usmc.mil.

NOTE:  Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these services or to issue a solicitation.  No solicitation documents exist at this time.  The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this RFI and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers.  Any information the Contractor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such.

In accordance with FAR 36.601-1 and -2, Acquisition of A/E Services shall be made through competitive procedures.  A review of CCR in NAICS 541330 was conducted to ascertain if there were sufficient SDVOSB firms to meet the competitive requirement.  The search resulted in 67 SDVOB firms. Previous AE solicitations, we've received responses from 8 and more SDVOSB AE firms. Therefore, it has been determined that there will be sufficient SDVOSB AE response/competition for this project.

A/E Selections are based on FAR Part 36 - 

FAR Part 36.602-1 Selection criteria states:
(a) Agencies shall evaluate each potential contractor in terms of its- 
(1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services; 
(2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials; 
(3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; 
(4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; 
(5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; and 
(6) Acceptability under other appropriate evaluation criteria. 
(b) When the use of design competition is approved by the agency head or a designee, agencies may evaluate firms on the basis of their conceptual design of the project. Design competition may be used when- 
(1) Unique situations exist involving prestige projects, such as the design of memorials and structures of unusual national significance; 
(2) Sufficient time is available for the production and evaluation of conceptual designs; and 
(3) The design competition, with its costs, will substantially benefit the project. 
(c) Hold discussions with at least three of the most highly qualified firms regarding concepts, the relative utility of alternative methods and feasible ways to prescribe the use of recovered materials and achieve waste reduction and energy-efficiency in facility design (see Part 23). 

In addiiton, FAR Part 36.602-3 Evaluation board functions. 
Under the general direction of the head of the contracting activity, an evaluation board shall perform the following functions: 
(a) Review the current data files on eligible firms and responses to a public notice concerning the particular project (see 36.604). 
(b) Evaluate the firms in accordance with the criteria in 36.602-1. 
(c) Hold discussions with at least three of the most highly qualified firms regarding concepts and the relative utility of alternative methods of furnishing the required services. 
(d) Prepare a selection report for the agency head or other designated selection authority recommending, in order of preference, at least three firms that are considered to be the most highly qualified to perform the required services. The report shall include a description of the discussions and evaluation conducted by the board to allow the selection authority to review the considerations upon which the recommendations are based. 

In conclusion, it is my determination that there are sufficient SDVOSB firms qualified with this area of expertise available to proceed with a competitive A/E procurement.  In addition, after review of the SDVOSB firms under this NAIC in VetBiz, a determination was made there is sufficient qualified SDVOSB firms within 100 mile radius in order to set this procurement aside as an SDVOSB.   Therefore, it is in the best interest of the government to advertise this requirement as an SDVOSB set-aside and allow for a SDVOSB preference during evaluations.

<CONTACT>
<DESC>This is a notification of intent to award a modification to increase the ceiling on the Performance Based Environmental Multiple Award Contract to support modification of the firm fixed price contract task order (â€œCTOâ€) 0005 to contract N62473-08-D-8816 with AMEC Earth & Environmental, Inc. (â€œAMECâ€) based on AMEC as the only responsible source to satisfy agency requirements.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) & (d)(1)(B), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (â€œFARâ€) 6.302-1(a)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The increased ceiling will allow for support of unforeseen site conditions encountered in the course of performing the current contract for the Non Time Critical Removal Action (â€œNTCRAâ€) at Hangar One located at former Naval Air Station Moffett Field, Mountain View, California.
  AMEC is the only contractor that is capable of meeting the NTCRA schedule for Hangar One and satisfying the agencyâ€™s needs for the NTCRA.  AMEC resources are currently mobilized at the Hangar One site allowing for critical timesaving and avoidance of duplicative effort and costs to the Government.  The NTCRA is currently underway and the increase to the contract ceiling is required to ensure continuity of the work.  The Justification will be posted as required by FAR 6.305.

<a href="mailto:Pratt.Nicole@epa.gov">Pratt, Nicole</a>
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION TO EXTEND CONTRACT PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE
1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity: Superfund/RCRA Regional Procurement Operations Division (SRRPOD), Office of Acquisition Management, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is requesting the approval of a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition for the extension of the EP-R7-06-17 Maintenance, Modification, and Upgrade of ASPECT RS800 Infrared Systems support contract.  2.  Nature and/ or description of the action being approved: 
Under the authority of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) of 1980, as amended; Section 311 of the Clean Water Act(CWA), as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA); and pursuant to the National Oiland Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP); and Presidential Decision Document (PDD) #39, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been delegated the responsibility to undertake response actions with respect to the release or threat of release of oil, petroleum products, hazardous substances, or pollutants and contaminants, that pose an actual or potential threat to human health or welfare, or to the environment. EPA is responsible for conducting evaluations of uncontrolled hazardous substance release sites. 
The US Environmental Protection Agency, National Decontamination Team is currently fielding a high level standoff hazards detection project under the program name of Airborne Spectral Photometry of Environmental Contaminants Technology (ASPECT). This program has the primary mission of remote detection of chemical vapors, plumes, and clouds. EPA is deploying the technology primarily to provide first responders and other emergency personnel with detailed chemical vapor plume information at the scene of the releases. Due to the critical nature of this emergency response component and since no follow on contract has been established, it has been determined that limiting competition for the contract extension to the current contract holder, Raytheon Company, would be of the best interest to the Government.
3.  Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency?s needs: 
The purpose of this requirement is to provide a mechanism for conducting maintenance, modifications, and upgrades to existing and new infrared line scanner systems used by the ASPECT program. This effort is focused around the RS-800 infrared line scanner design and its support subsystems. The ASPECT program is a unique sensor platform currently fielded to support emergency response missions and Nationally Significant Security Event (NSSE) activities. With the single IRLS system providing support for emergency response, it is critical to the program that both units remain in near continuous operational status. Whenever a unit and/or its critical subcomponents require scheduled maintenance or emergency repair this contract extension shall provide a means to quickly execute servicing of the IRLS and the related support equipment. 
The main components of remote chemical sensor systems consist of infrared detectors and their associated control systems, geo-spacial locaters, computers and communication equipment. Reliable operation of the ASPECT system is mandatory due to the emergency response nature of the program. The program currently uses two sets of identical sensors packages with one set being in flight status and the other serving as backup. Sensors and instruments are pulled from flight status at routine intervals for preventive maintenance, after a unit fails to operate correctly, or when a unit falls out of calibration. Maintenance and/or repair of the sensors must be accomplished in as short a time frame as possible to minimize down time of the system. 
The extension period of performance consists of an initial three (3) month base period with three (3) additional one (1) month option periods, not to exceed six (6) months.  The total estimated value of the contract extension is $312,397.89, calculated by the evaluation of the last six months of Monthly Reports submitted by Raytheon for the current contract.  
4.  Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition: 
FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and compelling urgency - Citations:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (2) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2).  It is the Government?s position that this requirement is of such unusual and compelling urgency that the Government could be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources permitted to bid on the contract extension for EP-R7-06-17 Maintenance, Modification, and Upgrade of ASPECT RS800 Infrared Systems.  
5.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor?s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:
Since the late 1990?s the incumbent contractor, Raytheon, has provided a mechanism for conducting maintenance, modifications, and upgrades to the existing RS800 Airborne Infrared Line Scanner (IRLS) System.  Raytheon is the original designer and manufacturer of the RS800 IRLS.  
The system was originally designed and produced under a federally funded government research program.  The specifications and performance of the system were directed by government researchers.  Their design and manufacture were funded through the federal research program.  The production of the completed units involved unique, specialized methods to produce the infrared filters and detectors. Core and unique features of the RS800 system include an array of specially designed and manufactured cold optical filters integrated onto a unique detector and assembly that provides for a wide geometric scan subsystem with maximum sensitivity.  These units were designed and manufactured to provide data outputs that can be processed to identify and map chemical vapors in the atmosphere at the currently achievable lowest limits of detection.  The current vendor, Raytheon directed the production of the filters, detector and the assembly.  The field testing and response of the units was ver ified and completed under the prior research program efforts and later transitioned to EPA.  
&#8195;6.  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable: 
As a result of the EP-R7-06-17 Maintenance, Modification, and Upgrade of ASPECT RS800 Infrared Systems expiring on March 26, 2011, the recompete process was initiated on August 20, 2010.  In an effort to ensure that offers were solicited from as many potential sources as practicable, on October 22, 2010 a sources sought notice was issued, on December 1, 2010 a pre-solicitation notice was issued and on January 13, 2011 a Request for Proposals was issued.  All correspondence regarding this requirement has been posted on the EPA webpage as well as on the FedBizOpps website.  
7.  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  
It is anticipated that the Government will award the EP-R7-06-17 Maintenance, Modification, and Upgrade of ASPECT RS800 Infrared Systems contract extension based on current Option Year III rates that have been previously determined fair and reasonable at the time of contract award; however, a subsequent determination will be made at the time of award.
8.  A description of the market research conducted: 
1.	October 22, 2010 ? To determine the availability of potential small business firms for a possible small business set-aside a Sources Sought Notice was posted publically.  One response was received.  2.	December 1, 2010 ? To notify all vendors of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management?s (OAM) intent to award a competitive contract to maintain modify and upgrade existing and new infrared line scanner systems used by the Airborne Spectral Photometry of Environmental Contaminants Technology (ASPECT) program a Pre-Solicitation notice was posted publically.  One question was received.  3.	January 13, 2011 ? A Request for Proposals was issued, closing on February 15, 2011 at 12:00 pm EST.  Due to an unanticipated Government facility interruption that took place on February 15, 2011 the RFP closing date was extended one business day.  Since the solicitation received no proposals at the time of initial closing on February 15, 2011 and due to the important and critical nature of the infrared line scanner system; it was determined on February 16, 2011 to be in the best interest of the Government to extend the RFP for an additional thirty (30) days.4.	February 16, 2011 ? The Request for Proposals was extended for an additional thirty (30) days, closing on March 16, 2011 at 12:00pm EST.  
9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: 
The performance of the RS-800 units is considered International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) export restricted.  The specifications for the current systems were produced under a federal government program and as such can be supplied to qualifying sources that can demonstrate their ability to adhere to the ITAR restrictions while servicing the RS800 device without the ongoing involvement of the original manufacturer.  
Selection of an alternative vendor to provide the required services will require time to obtain and evaluate proposals in addition to determine their ability to adhere to the ITAR restrictions and become proficient at servicing the units.  Selection of an alternative sensor unit or design is impractical at this time due to the manufacturing lead-time, current data processing software developments, and operational investments necessary to integrate a new sensor with the current ASPECT system.   
10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: 
1.	LR Tech/ Ionetrics2.	INPUT Government Community3.	L-3 Aeromet 4.	Rae Systems, Inc
11.  A Statement of any actions the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: 
In an effort to overcome any potential barriers that would prohibit future exclusion of any future bidders, a competitive RFP for the EP-R7-06-17 Maintenance, Modification, and Upgrade of ASPECT RS800 Infrared Systems a solicitation for the follow-on contract has been publically issued on the EPA, FedBizOpps and Fed-Connect websites.   
12.  Contracting Officer Certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer?s knowledge and belief: 
It is the Contracting Officer?s certification that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer?s knowledge and belief.

This new equipment will be used in conjunction with the lab's other Gerstel autosampler to analyze pesticides and PCB's by EPA methods 508 and 608. 
Gerstel's system is based on a proprietary design: The operational software's uniqueness is demonstrated by its ability to integrate with the autosampler into Agilent's ChemStation software, allowing for "prep-ahead" or just-in-time injections as required by the Government's minimum requirements. In addition, Gerstel offers other Government requirements including enhanced features such as its upgradeable path to add a thermal desorber, SPE & filtration options, centrifugation and the capability of conversion into a HPLC autosampler. 
Purchasing GC/MS systems from other vendors would result in additional costs: The software is significantly different from existing Agilent software and would call for increased costs (i.e. separate maintenance agreements, the inability to share parts with the current instruments & training). Data is automatically uploaded from instruments to a LIMS system - This requires a specific protocol and would have to be developed anew for an instrument purchased from a different manufacturer, resulting in data entry and processing delays. In summary, purchasing the Gerstel System will have the most significant impact on increasing productivity and efficiency for the lab while saving the Government significant duplication costs. 
6. Description of the market research conducted (see FAR Part 10).  
Several companies, particularly those selling CTC CombiPAL Systems, were researched. This research indicated that Gerstel, when compared to other suppliers, had the following unique capabilities: Software that integrates into Agilent's ChemStation software, an upgradeable path to add a thermal desorber, SPE & filtration options, centrifugation and the ability to easily convert into a HPLC autosampler.  	7. Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. 	Chemists are already trained in utilizing this equipment. Therefore, as well as the savings realized thru interoperability of systems, administrative savings would be realized.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Request for Quote number is N212470270D014.  Quotes are due not later than 4:00 P.M. EST on 310 March 2011. Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-49 are incorporated.  This NAICS code is 423450. Small Business size standard is 500 employees.  The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to negotiate on a Brand Name Only basis, to procure a Nautilus CC Plus 220V w/ starter kit (see items below), manufactured by Bego USA, 24 Albion Road Suite 103 Lincoln, RI 02865.
  Brand name only is specified because it would incur a substantial duplication of cost, to consider other than the Nautilus CC Plus 220V w/ starter kit, that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Any vendors who can provide the brand name only equipment are encouraged to submit a quote. The Government contemplates award of a firm-fixed price contract. This acquisition is being conducted under the FAR 13.5 Test Procedures for Certain Commercial Items.    

The offerorâ€™s initial proposal shall contain the offerorâ€™s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.   The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.
  The Government reserves the right to make no award as a result of this solicitation.

Regulatory Requirements: 
The Nautilus CC Plus 220V w/ starter kit and all of its components, shall be compliant with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements to market and deliver medical products for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.  The claims made for the product shall comply with the regulations of the FDA with respect to products for marketing and delivery of a medical product for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.
EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The lowest price technically acceptable offeror for this brand name only requirement will represent best value to the Government.
  The government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price Contract.
BUSINESS QUOTE INSTRUCTIONS:  Offerors shall price each CLIN and shall submit firm-fixed pricing for all CLINS, otherwise your quote will be determined to be substantially incomplete and not warrant any further consideration.  If there is no separate price for a CLIN, this must be stated.  Brand name only. No substitutions will be allowed.  Shipping shall be FOB Destination.  The site of shipment is Northrup Grumman Newport News. Business quotes will be evaluated for Completeness (all CLINS are priced) and Reasonableness (the degree to which the proposed prices compare to prices that a reasonable, prudent person would expect to incur for the same or similar equipment and commensurate with the Governmentâ€™s need).
 The government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract.  Include commercial price lists and, if applicable, any FSS schedule numbers and pricing and any applicable discounts to the Government.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to IMS Health, Inc., 16128 Red Mountain Trail, Fountain Hills, AZ, 85268 for Data Collectiion for Evaluation of the Effectiveness of 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine: Impact of Antibiotic Prescribing on Antibiotic-Resistant Pneumococcal Disease
<p>Background and Need - The introduction of PCV7 in 2000 led to sharp reductions in the incidence of antibiotic resistant pneumococcal disease. However, small increases in pneumococcal disease caused by non-PCV7 serotypes have also been observed. This phenomenon-known as serotype replacement-has been marked by increases in antibiotic resistant pneumococcal strains more than antibiotic susceptible strains. One potential explanation for this observation is the increasing use of azalide antibiotics, such as azithromycin, for outpatient treatment of respiratory infections over the past decade. If this were true, it would have important implications for antibiotic prescribing practices and for the interpretation of any increases in antibiotic resistant pneumococcal disease that might occur after PCV13 introduction. To test this hypothesis, it is necessary to obtain information on outpatient antibiotic use. The purpose of this contract is to engage the services of a contractor to provide retail pharmacy data to assess the relationship, if any, between outpatient antibiotic use, PCV13 effectiveness, and trends in antibiotic resistant pneumococcal disease.</p>
<p>Project Objective - 1. To compare outpatient antibiotic use data to trends in antibiotic resistant pneumococcal disease to understand the forces contributing to the spread of resistance; 2. To assess antibiotic use by: a. Patient age and sex, b. Calendar month prescribed, c. Prescriber specialty, d. Geographic location (defined by county), e. State, f. Year, and g. Anti-infective category; 3. To identify provider types and geographic areas where interventions by the CDC's Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work program will help reduce the spread of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal disease.</p>
<p>Scope of Work - The Contractor will provide a customized extract of data as outlined below. The Contractor will support the analyses of the data in collaboration with CDC as well as contribute to interpretation of data and authorship of any articles. <br /><br />Technical Requirements - This study is a retrospective analysis of a national representative database of outpatient anti-infective prescriptions. The data required for analysis is from information collected 1/1/2005-12/31/2009 that has been extrapolated to reflect the U.S. population with an extract of additional data from 1/1/2010- 12/31/2010.</p>
<p>Pertinent variables<br />Anti-infective name<br />Anti-infective prescribed time period (defined by calendar month and year)<br />Patient age (categorized)<br />Patient sex<br />Geographic area prescribed<br />Prescriber specialty</p>
<p>Evaluation, data analysis, and sample size collection<br />1. All patients prescribed an anti-infective will be included in the analysis. Only systemic (oral and injectable), acute anti-infectives will be included. Prescribing will by compared by differences based on age, sex, geographic area, time prescribed, and anti-infective class. Patient age will be categorized by the following standardized categories (0-2, 3-9, 10-19, 20-39, 40-59, 60-64, 65-74, 75-84, 85+, unknown). Physician specialty will be defined according to the American Medical Association (AMA); categorized into 17 categories relevant to outpatient prescribing as specified by the research team. The data will be downloaded and stored in electronic tables. The statistical program SAS&reg; Version 9.2 shall be used for statistical and data analyses; 2. Anti-infective class will be defined according to American Hospital Formulary Service (AHFS). Spectrum of anti-infective activity (broad vs. narrow) will be defined according to the anti-infective class; 3. Geographic area will be defined by the county where the medication was dispensed. Geographic area will also be stratified by urban vs. rural locales; defined by the US Census Bureau; 4. The data will be evaluated to examine results for: Frequency of anti-infectives overall, by class, and spectrum of activity; Frequency of anti-infectives by patient age and sex; Percentage of patients prescribed anti-infectives by geographic location and by rural vs. urban areas; Percentage of antibiotic class prescribed by month of the calendar year; Frequency of prescribing by physician specialty by anti-infective class and spectrum of activity.</p>
<p>Delivery of two data extracts 1st deliverable within 30 days of award issue (see details under "Deliverables"). The data extract will contain the following variables and will represent a projection to 100% of all US prescriptions in the retail pharmacy setting:<br />a. Calendar month prescribed<br />b. Prescriber specialty<br />c. Geographic location (defined by county)<br />d. State<br />e. Year<br />f. Anti-infective category<br />g. Patient age and gender<br />1st Extract: January 2005-December 2009<br />2nd Extract: January 2010-December 2010<br />SAS Dataset (Fixed Width)</p>
<p>CDC will be responsible for data analyses with technical support from the vendor that will require 5 person hours per month for 6 months, followed by 1 person hour per month for an additional 6 months. The vendor will review manuscripts for accuracy as a coauthor. This will require a maximum of 20 hours of person time for this particular request.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.)

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>307-17a CONFLICT OF INTEREST CERTIFICATION (AUG 2007)<br />(A) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, by signing the form in this clause, certifies that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest) (or apparent conflict of interest), for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: 1. Unequal access to information- a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has access to non-public information through its performance on a government contract. 2. Biased ground rules- a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract, 3. Impaired objectivity- a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person's objectivity: - financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; - significant connections to teaching methodologies or approaches that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property or services; or - significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property or services. Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict, including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause , the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (B) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (C) Remedies - The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of Title 31, U.S. Code, Section 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government. The Contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest. (D) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. (E) The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (E). Conflict of Interest Certification The Offeror, _______________________________, hereby certifies that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no present or currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed under the contract or task order resulting from Request for Proposal No. ____________ that would create any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflicts of interest) (including conflicts of interest for immediate family members: spouses, parents, children) that would impinge on its ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advice or result in it being given an unfair competitive advantage. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. The Offeror further certifies that it has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government's satisfaction, such Conflict of Interest (or apparent conflict of interest). <br />Offeror's Name ___________________________________________________ <br />RFP/Contract No. _________________________________________________ <br />Signature ________________________________________________________ <br />Title ____________________________________________________________ <br />Date ____________________________________________________________ <br /><br /><br />310-16 POST EMPLOYMENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST (MARCH 1985)<br />The contractor certifies that in developing a proposal in response to the solicitation for this contract, it has not utilized the services of any former Education Department (ED) employee who, while working for the Government, participated personally and substantially in, or was officially responsible for, the development or drafting of the solicitation for this contract. The contractor further certifies that it did not utilize the services of such an ED employee in assisting or representing the offeror at negotiations for this contract.</p>

Major, regarding past performance, is any subcontractor that is subcontracted for a minimum of 25% of the total contract amount. Each major subcontractor shall identify the name of the prime contractor on each of its past performance forms. If the offeror has no relevant corporate or organizational past performance, the offeror may substitute past performance of a predecessor company or of the offeror's management or proposed key personnel who have relevant experience. <br />A. Each offeror shall submit information about its most recent four contracts, completed in the last three years or currently in process, which are of similar size, scope, complexity or, in any way, are relevant to the effort required by this solicitation.

Other than the information requested in A above, offerors should not provide general information on their performance on the identified contracts. General performance information will be obtained from the references. <br />C. Offerors should understand the difference between experience and past performance. Experience reflects the offeror's capability of performing a requirement. Past performance reflects how well it has performed similar requirements. In assessing past performance, the quality of the offeror's past performance is of primary significance, not the quantity of previous contracts performed. An offeror's experience will be evaluated in the technical proposal. For further guidance on including information on experience or how experience will be evaluated refer to the technical proposal instructions and evaluation criteria. <br />D. The offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror possesses a high-quality process for developing and producing the product or service required.

Ask each reference to complete the form and return it to the contracting officer as prescribed on the form. Completed forms from references are due l0 calendar days after the date proposals are due under this solicitation. Request that the reference please return the completed form to the contracting officer by this date. Do not ask the reference to give you a copy of the completed form or any information therefrom. Beyond that initial request, you do not need to follow up with the reference; the contracting officer will contact the reference if necessary. <br />F. Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services. Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which offerors' relative rankings will be compared to assure best value to the government. The government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration. The "Past Performance" form identified in Attachment D will be used to collect this information. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government with the information received in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.<br />311-6 CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS (APRIL 1998)<br />Offerors must submit all clarification questions concerning this solicitation in writing to the contract specialist.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, are being utilized for this acquisition. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-48.
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541512. This requirement is being competed as a small business set-aside. The Government anticipates a fixed price type purchase order.</p>
<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION:<br />The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:<br />FAR 52.212-1; FAR 52.212-3; FAR 52.212-4; FAR 52.212-5, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3, and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a)(1), and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-36; 52.225-13; 52.232-33. All provisions and clauses viewed at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html.<br /><br />The following standards of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 apply to this requirement: 1194.31 and 1194.41.<br /><br />Description of Requirement:<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD, has developed Standard Reference Material (SRM) Bullets for testing automated optical systems used in crime lab investigations of bullet evidence from firearms and is developing SRM Cartridge Cases (Casings) for testing these systems when used for examining casing evidence. An important attribute of these materials is their high similarity from one SRM unit to the next so that different laboratories on the same network can check the operation of their systems with the same tests and expect the same results.&nbsp;NIST has also developed both optical and contacting systems for measurement and analysis of surface topography 1) for demonstrating the quality and similarity of the SRM materials and 2) for research into optimizing the accuracy and minimizing the uncertainty of optical measurements of bullet and casing surfaces. The systems for surface topography analysis include research software written in the MATLAB language for quantifying the similarity of a pair of surface topography images.</p>
<p>NIST is continuing its research in all these areas and is initiating research in the surface topography of toolmark evidence as well.</p>
<p>As part of its continuing research into optical measurements for surface topography measurement, NIST requires the services of experts in the analysis of surface topography, in the registration and correlation of topographic images, and in the manufacture of reproducible toolmarks. <br />The contractor shall be responsible for providing the requirements in the attached Statement of Work.<br /><br />SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION <br />Quotation Submission Instructions:<br />The Offeror shall include the following information in its open market quotation, organized as indicated below.</p>
<p>a. Technical Approach: The Offeror shall provide a written, detailed Technical Approach for how it proposes to satisfy the requirements of the Statement of Work in this solicitation.

The Technical Approach shall include a Work Plan that describes its proposed plan to manage individual tasks required by the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>b. Experience:<br />A detailed narrative that demonstrates the breadth and depth of the Offeror's experience in performing work that is similar in scope to the requirements of the Statement of Work. The Offeror shall also describe any certifications and forms of recognition from other entities with respect to the Offeror's relevant experience and/or expertise, with a demonstration of their technical expertise and experience in applied pattern recognition and ballistics inspection.</p>
<p>c. Cost/Price:<br />The Government contemplates award of a fixed price type purchase order resulting from this solicitation.<br />The Offeror shall specify the fixed price for the work required in the attached Statement of Work.<br />All questions regarding this solicitation shall be submitted to divya.soni@nist.gov. The email should reference the solicitation number.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: <br />The Government intends to use a tradeoff process to award a purchase order to the responsible Offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, evaluated cost/price and other factors considered. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest-cost/priced offeror or to the offeror with the highest technical rating on the non-price evaluation factors if the contracting officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.<br /><br />Upon receipt of proposals, the contracting officer will review them to determine if each offeror followed all of the proposal preparation instructions in this solicitation. A proposal that did not follow the proposal submission instructions may be deemed unacceptable and may not be further evaluated.</p>
<p>Each proposal will be evaluated against the factors described below.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors:</p>
<p>A. Technical Approach: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's proposed Technical Approach to determine the extent to which it demonstrates the Offeror's understanding of the requirements of the Statement of Work and addresses the required Tasks and Deliverables there.<br /><br />B. Experience of Key Personnel: The Government will evaluate the breadth and depth of the Offeror's demonstrated experience in performing work of similar scope and complexity. In general, the Contractor shall have technical expertise and experience in applied pattern recognition and ballistics inspection. Specifically, The Contractor shall have staff member(s) with the following technical expertise:</p>
<p>&bull; Expertise in the topography analysis of bullet and cartridge case surfaces as shown by a publication record on either subject at conferences and in archival journals.<br />&bull; Expertise on the development of software for registration of images as shown by a publication record on this subject at conferences and in archival journals.<br />&bull; Expertise in the creation of analysis software in MATLAB as shown by existing software created by the Contractor</p>
<p>C. Evaluated Price/Cost: The Government shall evaluate the reasonableness of the offerors' proposed price of the overall solution.</p>
<p>Factors A, B, and C have equal importance.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a purchase order without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial quotation should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost/price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.</p>

#SOL-NC-11-00020 
THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6 "SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS", AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  
The solicitation number is SOL-NC-11-00020 . The solicitation is for FULL AND OPEN competition Request for Quotation (RFQ) using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-41. This procurement will utilize NAICS Code 541711 with a size standard of 500 employees or less. 
The US Environmental Protection Agency intends to award a contract for Functional Gene Array (FGA) Microarray Analysis for Characterization of Soil DNA Samples in support of the Office of Research and Development, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL), Western Ecology Division (WED) in Corvallis and Newport, Oregon.  WED is a multi-disciplinary, ecological research laboratory that performs state of the art research.  
The primary objective of this effort will be the characterization of the community composition and functional diversity of the soil microbial populations obtained by EPA and sent to the contractor.  It is anticipated the contractor will prepare and process from 80 to 398 genomic DNA samples (supplied by USEPA) for analysis on FGA microarray. The contractor will provide assistance with data analysis, including ordination (PCA-RDA or DCA-CCA) and cluster analysis, diversity indices, and relative abundance of gene groups to get an overall picture of the statistically significant similarities and differences in soil microbial community functions, and based on the results of that data, provide a more in-depth look at certain gene groups either using the above techniques or other methods. Following the completion of individual specified sets of data from e.g., the collaborator production field and natural area samples and samples from designated experimental sets in Oregon, the con tractor shall additionally provide statistical analyses that compare the different specified sets (or subsets) that are to be specifically compared for gene families of interest as determined in prior FGA microarray soil DNA analyses. EVALUATION CRITERIAEvaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of provision # FAR 52.212-2(a) are as follows: TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES CRITERIA:a)	Demonstration of Minimum Qualification Requirements:  i)	Lab management or personnel with at least 1 year experience (1)	preparing and applying soil-derived genomic DNA for functional gene array (FGA) data collection and analyses (2)	collection and statistical analyses of microarray data (see Statement of Work) in a manner that is specifically designed to minimize the false discovery rate and maximizes the elimination of false negatives.ii)	Ability to meet the minimum turn around requirements for the duration of the study (see Statement of Work, Milestones and Deliverables); iii)	Ability to perform each analysis with a minimum of five micrograms of DNA sample; b)	A list of at least 2 publications in scientific peer-reviewed journals that have used functional soil microarray data provided by them; c)	Submission of an electronic version of what the offeror would consider to qualify as a "Quality Assurance Manual" or ?Standard Operating Procedures? used to support the routine quality of its FGA data for soil DNA samples; this document shall be in a Word (.doc) or Portable Document Format (.pdf) format.  In lieu of a formal QA manual, the offeror may follow the attached description for their QA system (Respondent Requirements Demonstrating Their Organization?s Quality Assurance and Quality Control System).d)	Offerors shall submit a response to the following questions:i)	How does your laboratory deal with nucleic acid samples of varying quantity and quality (that are approximately known) when performing microarray analyses?ii)	How close do the nucleic acid quantity and quality need to be to the ideal values in order for your instrumentation to work?iii)	If DNA samples are found to be of insufficient quantity or quality, what remedial actions can the offeror perform to improve the chance of successful data collection?2)	PAST PERFORMANCE a)	Submit a list of 3 "customers" who have submitted soil-derived DNA samples for analysis within the past 2 years.  Include specific individuals to contact and their contact information, i.e, phone and email address.  Past performance will be evaluated as follows:  quality of product or service, timeliness of performance   ability to adhere to deadlines, and overall customer satisfaction; and 3)	PRICE a)	Technical capability and past performance when combined are significantly more important than price.  Award will be made to the offeror whose offer represents the best value to the Government considering the criteria referenced above.  As offers become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated price becomes more important.

The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</p>
<p><br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>(xv) 52.246-16 Responsibility for Supplies (Apr 1984)<br />(a) Title to supplies furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon formal acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession, unless the contract specifically provides for earlier passage of title.<br />(b) Unless the contract specifically provides otherwise, risk of loss of or damage to supplies shall remain with the Contractor until, and shall pass to the Government upon --<br />(1) Delivery of the supplies to a carrier, if transportation is f.o.b. origin; or<br />(2) Acceptance by the Government or delivery of the supplies to the Government at the destination specified in the contract, whichever is later, if transportation is f.o.b. destination.<br />(c) Paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply to supplies that so fail to conform to contract requirements as to give a right of rejection. The risk of loss of or damage to such nonconforming supplies remains with the Contractor until cure or acceptance. After cure or acceptance, paragraph (b) of this section shall apply.<br />(d) Under paragraph (b) of this section, the Contractor shall not be liable for loss of or damage to supplies caused by the negligence of officers, agents, or employees of the Government acting within the scope of their employment.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>(xviii) 52.247-34 F.o.b. Destination (Nov 1991)<br />(a) The term "f.o.b. destination," as used in this clause, means --<br />(1) Free of expense to the Government, on board the carrier's conveyance, at a specified delivery point where the consignee's facility (plant, warehouse, store, lot, or other location to which shipment can be made) is located; and<br />(2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee's wharf (if destination is a port city and supplies are for export), warehouse unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the Contractor. The Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or "constructive placement" as defined in carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used, supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier (including "piggyback") is used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee, except when the supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item 568 of the National Motor Freight Classification for "heavy or bulky freight." When supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item 568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested. If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarded for less than carload shipments, the contractor shall ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee.<br />(b) The Contractor shall --<br />(1)<br />(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or<br />(ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements;<br />(2) Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading;<br />(3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the contract;<br />(4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the contract;<br />(5) Furnish a delivery schedule and designate the mode of delivering carrier; and<br />(6) Pay and bear all charges to the specified point of delivery.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

Privacy and security sections - pertinent to Chaplain Services
VA HANDBOOK 6500.6
APPENDIX C

1.	GENERAL
Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.
2.	ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS
a.	A contractor/subcontrator shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.
b.	All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
c.	Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.
d.	Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.
e.	The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.
3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE
a.	Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).
b.	VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.
c.	Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.
d.	The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.
e.	The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.
f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality,
privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold
payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.
g.	If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.
h.	The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.
i.	The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.
j.	Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.
k.	Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus.

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br />(h) Multiple awards.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to the combined synopsis/solicitation is to post the answers to the questions recieved in response to the notice:<br /><br />Question 1:&nbsp; What does the lift gate on the box trucks need to be rated at for maximum capacity?
<p>Answer 1:&nbsp; No lift gate required, want a loading ramp that stows under the vehicle</p>
<p>Question 2:&nbsp; The due date of the solicitation is March 21st, but when is the expected start date of the Contract?</p>
<p>Answer 2:&nbsp; IAW the PWS the required delivery date is 28 April 2011 and the contract will begin at that time.</p>
<p>Question 3:&nbsp; When referring to a 15ft. Box Truck I just want to make sure that we are talking about the same thing. We are talking about a Enclosed Box Truck or also known as a Cube Van? I say this because the specs call for a rear defogger and if it is a cube van or enclosed box truck that window would be entirely blocked to see out of it. However if the vehicle is a flat bed or stake bed vehicle then the window would be able to be used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Answer 3:&nbsp; There should not be any windows in the rear of the truck. The required truck is similar to any Ryder, U-Haul or Budget moving vehicles, a cutaway van is not what is requested.<br /><br />Question 4:&nbsp; How do I submit my proposal?<br /><br />Answer 4:&nbsp; As stated in the notice, quotes can be mailed to the 11 CONS/LGCBA 1535 Command Drive, Suites E-209-EE218 Joint Base Andrews NAF, MD 20762, faxed to (301) 981-1910 or e-mailed to rhonda.coles@afncr.af.mil.</p>

<DESC><p>The above solicitation is hereby amended to address vendor questions and answers and to extend the due date for quotes as follows:</p>
<p>1. The primary mirror - Do you care what material it is made of?</p>
<p>Answer: The mirror material does not matter explicitly, but there are implicit requirements contained within the image quality requirement. As long as the glass material properties are taken into account in the optomechanical design such that the optical performance (i.e. spot size) specification is met over normal observatory operation temperatures and gravity loading, then the specific glass material does not matter.</p>
<p>2. The focal ratio - Does "slower" mean that f/8 is acceptable?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, slower in this sense means the light path is converging more slowly than f/6.</p>
<p>3. Field of view and spot size - Does the "&lt;10 micron RMS" apply to all wavelengths and the entire field, or to one particular wavelength and one part of the field? For example, a 22" diameter, f/6 primary mirror has an airy disk diameter of 15.6 microns on axis at 1.064 nm, which seems to exceed the specification.</p>
<p>Answer: Entire field, all wavelengths.</p>
<p>4. Optical Design - How much back focal length (distance from the back of the mirror mounting plate to the focal plane) do you need?</p>
<p>Answer: A back focal distance of 50-150mm past the instrument mounting point, which is either the backplate of the mirror cell if focus is on the secondary mirror or the back surface of rear focuser if the focus is controlled behind the primary cell.</p>
<p>5. Optical Design and Tube - How much focal shift with temperature is permitted?</p>
<p>Answer: Our instrument is relatively insensitive to focus drifts and can tolerate up to +/- 1mm over the course of a typical nightly 20 C temperature swing. However, it is expected that with modern telescope mechanical designs, through passive structural design elements and/or active temperature-based focus feedback, far tighter focus can be maintained.</p>
<p>6. Tube - What is the maximum acceptable tube length?</p>
<p>Answer: The critical dimension is the tube clearance within the enclosure so is not strictly the tube length. The maximum distance on the telescope structure from intersection of the altitude and azimuth axes should not exceed 48".</p>
<p>7. Mount - What is your desired pointing resolution and accuracy? What electrical power is available?</p>
<p>Pointing resolution, 0.1 arcseconds rms or better. Pointing/tracking accuracy, unguided &lt; 5 arcseconds rms including uncorrected periodic error. Guided &lt; 0.5 arcseconds rms. Electrical power is standard 120V service.</p>
<p>8. The delivery date is specified to be 3 months after receipt of order. That is a very short lead time for optics. Is there some leeway on this delivery requirement?</p>
<p>Answer: No, delivery must be within 3 months after receipt of order to meet our current deadlines for projects that require this equipment.</p>
<p>The due date/time for quotes has been extended as follows:<br />FROM: January 20, 2011 @ 3pm EST<br />TO: January 27, 2011 @ 3pm EST</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

<p>TITLE: Emerging Computing Technology and Applications</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 09-08- RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800<br /><br />I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Information Directorate, Computing Technology Applications Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to explore and develop computational technologies with greater capacity, sophistication and assurance for addressing dynamic mission objectives under constraints imposed by Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), trusted/secure systems and performance requirement driven layered information processing battlefield networks.</p>
<p>Of particular interest are emerging technologies that will provide revolutionary computational capabilities and models, technologies for increased computational sophistication, algorithmic and software techniques for increased system functionality, architectures that will provide dramatic improvements in the performance/cost of systems, technologies for embedded processing and high performance computing, and technologies that will enhance productivity and use of advancements in computing architectures. Also of interest are technologies that can reduce war fighter decision latencies/response time, decrease system costs and system development times.</p>
<p>The overall objective of this BAA is to develop, integrate, and demonstrate emerging computing architecture technologies and applications. This effort will investigate the research, application and/or development of advanced computing architecture technologies, products and standards as they relate to the following technical areas:</p>
<p>(1) Emerging Computer Technology, alternative processing approaches that can deliver revolutionary computational capabilities crucial to maintaining technological progress.<br /><br />The objective of the research is to develop emerging quantum computing, nano-computing, optical computing, and neuromorphic computing technologies and evaluate their application to AF processing problems. This includes quantum computing algorithms, single-photon sources, solid-state and integrated-optics quantum computing, and distributed quantum computing. Also of interest are carbon nanotube interconnects, cross-bar nanocomputers, and nanofabrication technologies and self-organizing nanomaterials to precisely engineer nanometer-scale structures. Other technologies of interest are content-addressable memory, CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor)-molecular technology integration, digital and analog optical processing, CMOS optical interconnects, neuromorphic computing, neural-net processors, spikey-neuron technology. Emerging computer applications include secure data exploitation and fusion, signal processing, and command &amp; control optimization.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this technical area can be directed to:<br />Richard Michalak (315) 330-3150 Richard.Michalak@rl.af.mil</p>
<p>(2) Wireless Computational Networking (WCN)</p>
<p>The objective of this research is to understand the science and engineering behind Wireless Computational Networks (WCN).

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology. The technical concepts should be clearly defined and developed. The technical approach must be sufficiently detailed to support the proposed concepts and technical claims. (2) Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge to establish that the offeror has credible capability and experience to complete the proposed work. (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness. (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. Please note that use of the JIFFY or TFIMS application requires customers outside of the .mil domain to purchase an approved External Certificate Authority certificate to facilitate a secured log on process. It is necessary to obtain an ECA certificate BEFORE obtaining a JIFFY or TFIMS user account. Additional information on obtaining an ECA is available at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:<br />TPOC Name: Stanley Lis<br />Telephone: (315) 330-3275<br />Email: Stanley.Lis@rl.af.mil</p>

Contractor will be responsible for meeting requirements in the Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) (DOD 5105.38-M), and Air Force Manual 23-110, International Traffic and Arms Regulation (ITAR) and the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). The PROS contract is a Tri-Se! rvice program designed to acquire procurement services to meet the needs of our FMS Air Force, Navy and Army partners. North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code of 541614, (Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services) governs this acquisition with a size standard of $7M for small business.Contract Effort Description: This contract effort provides a means for our FMS partners to receive sustainment support for the procurement and maintenance of non-standard and hard-to-support standard items and associated services. The PROS program office currently uses an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to procure non-standard and, to a lesser extent, hard-to-support standard commodities in support of foreign military partners. Some of these material purchases have included installation and familiarization training and if required, individual Task Orders (TO) have been negotiated and awarded to accomplish these efforts. The PROS contractor is also responsible for procuring repair capabilities of military items owned by foreign partners. The PROS contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC. This PROS office oversees contractor performance through continuous oversight and quarterly reviews of the contractor's files and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The program office is considering either an incentive fee or fixed fee to reward exceptional procurement performance based on criteria negotiated with the PROS contractor and annotated during these quarterly reviews. The majority of the current contract value is based on sub-contractors actual material costs passed-through to the PROS contractor for the acquisition of goods and services. The contractor earns a fill fee for each acquisition performed. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDR) submitted by the foreign partners for discrepancies noted in receipt of goods or services throughout the contract period and will include SDRs filed up to one year after the last requisition shipment. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution weighing cost and risk. Capability or Performance: PROS supply and maintenance requirements correspond to functions currently performed by DOD depots. Responsibilities/services include but are not limited to: Item identification for program eligibility Past procurement reviewTech data reviewVendor base analysisPrice and availability informationDetermination of price fair and reasonableness IAW FARItem acquisition and/or maintenance including vendor selectionInvoicing and payment processingConfiguration coordination and controlInspection and acceptanceSupply Deficiency Reporting (SDR) interfaceVendor qualificationWarranties and warranty administration Packaging and handlingTransportationSAMIS interfaceResearch Catalogs (Haystack, Fedlog, D043 etc) The PROS IV contract will provide the flexibility needed to allow the contractor to acquire logistical and technical support services meeting the country's demand for cost effective, timely, and quality support. These contract/contracts will consist of a two-year (2) basic with three (3) one-year options. The estimated total contract value for the basic and option years, if exercised are $1 billion dollars. This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the US Government. Capabilities Package: All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines the firm's capabilities in providing the required services. Contractor is required to provide a high level explanation for the operation and management of the required services. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 17 DEC 2009. The PROS Program team will hold an industry day at the Hilton, Garden Inn, 3250 Pentagon Park Boulevard, Beavercreek OH 45431 on Thursday 17 Dec 2009 from 09:00 till 15:00. We will present a brief overview of the PROS III program followed by open questions. Points of Contact: The Contracting Officer for the PROS program is William T. Smith at William.smith4@wpafb.af.mil. All questions concerning this acquisition must be submitted in writing to the PCO for distribution to the acquisition team. Do not provide proprietary information in your questions to the contracting officer since all questions and answers will be shared amongst all interested parties.

<a href="mailto:suma.legesse@us.army.mil">CECOM Contracting Center (CECOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>Q1. I noticed various mentions of small business set-aside and unrestricted. Will there be two parts to this procurement?<br><br>A1. Based on the government analysis, it is recommended that the acquisition of the SSES NexGen be conducted on the basis of a partial set-aside with 2 suites of contract awards.  One being a full and open competition suite and the other being a small business set-aside suite. The partial small business set-aside provides guaranteed opportunity for small businesses to compete for requirements estimated to be below a specific threshold.  The Government is intending to award up to 4 awards for the unrestricted suite and award up to 4 awards for the partial set-aside suites.<br><br>Q2. Regarding the SSES solicitation W15P7T11RS601, it appears that the Government has migrated from IBOP to ASFI/FedBizOpps.  I cannot find the appropriate venue for submitting questions. Can you please provide instructions for how to use these sites to submit questions or confirm that we can submit to you via e-mail?<br><br>A2. You can submit questions via e-mail to the following POC's:<br><br>Kathleen Hageman, Contracting Officer at Kathleen.Hageman@us.army.mil<br>Heather Weaver, Contract Specialist at Heather.Weaver@us.army.mil<br>Suma Legesse, Contract Specialist at Suma.Legesse@us.army.mil <br><br>Q3. Given that this solicitation will result in an IDIQ contract vehicle, with competed RTEPs determining the type of work a successful contractor will be awarded, it is difficult for offerors to predict with certainty which of its subcontractors might reach the 20% threshold for work over the life of the contract. Would the Government accept past performance experience for up to three (3) major subcontractors that prime contractors pre-select as those with the most potential to receive 20% of the work, understanding that ultimately only two would meet this threshold (since small primes must perform a minimum of 51% of the work)?<br><br>A3. Prime contractors both large and small can submit as many subcontractors as they believe have potential to qualify as major subcontractors.

<SUBJECT>System to Provide NERC CIP Compliant Access to Substation Data
<SOLNBR>DE-RFI-WN04125
<RESPDATE>041511
<CONTACT>Eric M. Samuels, Contract Specialist, Phone 9163534537, Fax 9169851933, Email samuels@wapa.gov
<DESC>Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), Sierra Nevada Region (SNR) is interested in obtaining information from potential suppliers regarding systems that are designed to facilitate its compliance with current and future NERC Cyber Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Standards, while securely maintaining access to substation data for its maintenance engineers. The following sections list some of the areas of consideration that the Region is considering for possible implementation.
<p>Limited, Secure, Logical Access with CIP Compliance Capability. Provide information regarding system design that allows a single point of access at the substation that is designed to be secure and meet CIP Compliance. Describe the extent and method by which the system can be expanded to serve many serial and network devices in the substation while maintaining a single point of access. Describe what CIP requirements are met with your implementation, and how your implementation meets those requirements.</p>
<p>Features designed to meet CIP Compliance by taking advantage of existing security infrastructure. Western desires to take advantage of existing workflows and processes for its other systems to meet CIPS compliance for its Substation data. What features does your product provide that allows for centralized management of access that is synchronized to the existing corporate infrastructure (eg. LDAP, Active Directory)? What features facilitate the management associated with authorizing and tracking access to all resources in the system? Describe features of your product that have been implemented to meet the CIP stringent requirements for password change management at the IED level. Please describe features that provide for access control and rights for different levels of users at the IED level. Where and how are these features implemented in your system?</p>
<p>Management of IED Configurations. Please provide detailed information regarding features implemented to manage IED configurations. Of particular interest are features that support IED configuration version control, change tracking, detection of actual configuration changes (whether authorized or not), and reporting on configuration changes. Please describe comparison and reporting tools that facilitate the ability for a user to quickly determine and report on detailed changes that have taken place in the configuration of particular devices. Please provide a list of devices or file formats for which you support configuration management with the aforementioned features.</p>
<p>Non-operational Data (eg. Fault Data) - Automatic Machine-to-Machine Data Collection. Western SNR is interested in implementations that minimize remote transparent access to substation devices for the purpose of obtaining fault data. What features do your product support that provide for automatic data collection and machine-to-machine transfer of fault data from the substation to a secure control center location for later access by maintenance engineers? Please include details regarding:<br />1. What formats of fault data you directly support? Of particular interest, discuss your support of specific GE relays, Areva relays, and Schweitzer devices. <br />2. Please describe the mechanisms that are used to initiate and implement transfer of the data, where the data is stored along the way, and how the user may access it at its destination location.<br />3. Please describe the industry standard formats that you support such as COMTRADE. <br />4. How is the conversion from proprietary formats to standard formats accomplished? Is the conversion automatic?</p>
<p>Built in VPN Support. Describe built in VPN support that you provide between your system's components. Describe how your system could be used to support CIP electronic security perimeters.</p>
<p>Remote Transparent Access. While Western SNR has an interest in limiting the need for engineers to access remote devices, it also recognizes that it may not be able to completely avoid the need for Remote Transparent Access. Remote Transparent Access requires the implementation of some type of tunneling system through which data passes between the user on one end and the IED device on the other. Please answer the following questions regarding the tunneling system:<br />1. What mechanisms do you use to insure that the tunneling system is secure?<br />2. For Remote Transparent Access, what parts of your system do you use to control access and to document activity for CIPS compliance?<br />3. Tunnels should be completely transparent. Is there any restriction on characters for any of the tunnels that would prevent that tunnel from providing complete transparency?<br /><br />Alarm, Status, and Analog Data Support. Describe the support you provide for returning relay alarm data to a secure location for access by engineers. Similarly, describe how your system makes this data available to other systems such as SCADA systems using standard protocols such as DNP. What proprietary protocols do you support for communication with IEDs for this type of data. Of particular interest are GE, Areva, and Schweitzer relays.</p>
<p>Availability of Log Data. Failure of a system containing log data may mean that the log data is not available for CIP compliance auditors. What features in your system make it possible to avoid the loss of log data in the event of failure or compromise of system components?</p>
<p>Disaster Recovery. While disaster recovery is largely based upon the processes and procedures provide by the organization that owns the equipment, it is possible that certain features or system architecture in installed equipment may be able to facilitate disaster recovery. What features or architectural solutions does your system support to facilitate disaster recovery?<br /><br />Background:<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is for analysis and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government. This RFI is being used to identify and gather data. The Western Area Power Administration (Western), Sierra Nevada Regional Office is requesting information to provide NERC-CIP Compliant Access to Substation Data.</p>
<p>RFI Guidelines:<br /><br />Parties interested in submitting a response to this RFI should review the RFI Guidelines and questions provided on attachment before developing and submitting any responsive documents.</p>
<p>As indicated, this RFI is to solicit responses from the public for information and planning purposes only. This RFI is not a solicitation; therefore Western is not accepting quotes or proposals. Western will review all responses and consider them for information and planning purposes. Western will not pay for information provided.</p>

<CONTACT>Stephen T. Hughes, Phone 2026855932, Email stephen.t.hughes@navy.mil
<DESC>MSC's T-AOE 6 Class vessels have an obsolete auxiliary boiler control system causing maintenance and operational difficulties. The V2M Boilers are 125-psi oil-fired, natural circulation, water tube auxiliary boilers. There are two V2M Boilers per ship that provide service steam for auxiliary use underway and when needed, in port. Both boilers have burner management, combustion control and feedwater control systems creating the current boiler control system (BCS). The ship's service steam load fluctuates with the equipment running, ship's location/season and is dependant mainly on the following systems: house/hotel loads, water heaters, fuel heaters, air ejectors for evaporators, and purifier heaters. When in a low load condition, the existing combustion control equipment is not capable of operating at ideal efficiency and additional equipment must be operated to increase load. <br /><br />Military Sealift Command has decided to replace the existing BCS with a modern Programmable Logic Control (PLC) type boiler control system. This system shall provide reliable control over the entire boiler operating range. <br /><br />This contract will be firm-fixed price.&nbsp; Contractor will perform at various location dependent on ship availability.&nbsp; Contract includes a base and four options. Award is anticipated to be in the middle of December. <br />

<DESC>Military Sealift Fleet Support Command (MSFSC) has made the determination to separate the solicitation for the Fire Fighting Systems/Equipment into two separate contract actions 1) for the Fixed Fire Fighting Equipment/Systems, and 2) for the Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBAs). Therefore the prevailing solicitation will be amended and re-solicited to include only the fixed fire fighting systems for the Fleet. The SCBAs will be re-solicited on a separate requirement via the government portal (FedBizOpps and the MSC webpage) as soon as possible. To ensure continuity of the requirement the fire fighting systems will utilize the current solicitation as amended to extract the requirements for SCBAs. As soon as the requirement has been reviewed and approved for publicizing the solicitation will be released for industry interest and request for proposals. This is to be a new requirement and therefore all interested parties meeting the constraints of the requirement will be entertained. NAICS Code 336611 will be utilized for this requirement as per the original solicitation and the requirement will be set aside 100% for Small Businesses.

Proposals may be intended for incorporation into SD materials, applied to SD or modifications of blank SD manufacturing and/or personalization, and have at least one aspect that does not require a device for verification.&nbsp; Any offers submitted for consideration will be reviewed for inherent and relative effectiveness as a security feature and may be further assessed for compatibility with SD design and production processes, SD as issued durability, environmental acceptability, and all other manufacturing, accountability, storage, and personalization processing requirements. An effective feature is defined as one that cannot be easily simulated or reproduced so that the simulation or reproduction would deceive authentication examination.&nbsp; The Bureau will only consider technologies or materials for which at least laboratory feasibility has already been demonstrated (that is, a physical sample or product of the offered process can be shown).&nbsp; For initial screening purposes, interested parties are requested to submit preliminary samples and technical descriptions, no longer than one page, plus price information for possible purchase of larger test quantities. The Bureau may submit offers to outside technical experts who have agreed to keep samples secure and results confidential for their evaluation subject to the approval of CA and the submitting party.&nbsp; <br />The DoS is responsible for ensuring that appropriately marked proprietary information contained in information provided is protected from unauthorized disclosure. However, it is the company's responsibility to ensure that all information deemed proprietary is appropriately marked. The company shall include the following notice as a cover page to its information: This information shall be used and disclosed for evaluation purposes only, and a copy of this Government notice shall be applied to any reproduction or abstract thereof.

<DESC><p>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with National TASC (Treatment Accountability for Safer communities), on a sole source basis, to help demonstrate the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) support for the TASC offender case management model concept through he 17th National TASC Conference on Drugs and Crime. SAMHSA also intends to use this conference as a vehicle for more national recognition of and understanding of it's matrix cross-cutting principles as they relate to the priority area of criminal justice programming. The basis for restricting competition is the authority of 41 U.S.C 253(c) (1) as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1 because only one source is available to provide the service in a manner that will satisfy agency requirements. The anticipated contract period will be for approximately 5 months from the date from the date of award. National TASC can be considered the only responsible source because they are the sole organizer of the 17th National Conference on Drugs and Crime. The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise and qualifications to perform the work described above. Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government requirement as articulated above. No solicitation document is available. Capability statements should be submitted by 3:00 pm eastern standard time March 28, 2011 to the point of contract listed in this announcement.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents award of a modification to the existing contractor National Government Services, Inc. under the current contract number HHSM-500-2008-M0004Z in the amount of $93,535 authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 17, 2012. This data shall be obtained from the latest filed 12-month cost report. As later cost reports are accepted during the year, MACs shall update the data in FISS within 5 business days of acceptance of the cost report (for those hospitals that have not yet attested and received their initial payment). <br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<AWARDEE>AMIRSYS, INC;2180 S 1300 E # 405;SALT LAKE CITY;UT;841063382
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.


1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Medical Center, 5000 W. National Ave. Bldg. 5, Milwaukee, WI  53295

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for License agreement to Stadx Clinical Diagnostic Decision Support System for comprehensive imaging reference for VA Milwaukee.  Procurement will proceed on a sole source basis with Amirsys, a small business. 

3.  	A Description of Supplies/Services required:  This product STATdx Clinical Diagnostic Decision Support System is the only product that has: the most comprehensive imaging reference with over 2,500 separate diagnoses, over 9,000 individual patient cases examples of these diagnoses, and over 80,000 radiological images and color graphic illustrations. 
4.	Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition:  6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  (a) Authority.  (1) Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).

5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  Milwaukee VA implemented this diagnostic decision support system that is designed to support the practicing radiologist by increasing speed, accuracy and diagnostic confidence in complex cases three years ago.  STATdx streamlines workflow by reducing the time required to research and complete a difficult imaging analysis.  This is a comprehensive electronic reference system and consolidates several resources. 

This product allows the VISN radiologists to provide the most accurate and timely interpretations of radiologic images to the clinical staff.  In cases where there are multiple possibilities this product provides the information to reach a conclusion based on the most comprehensive data base available.

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  The Small Purchase Center and Contract Service Center conducted research and the facility concluded there were no viable GSA contracts for the product.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  Price was compared and confirmed with the end user on past purchases for the same or similar type of product and is comparable.

8.	Market survey conducted:  The facility performed market research and was unable to find any other companies that have the same comprehensive feature; ultimately they indicated that no services would meet their minimum comprehensive need.  The Contracting Officer searched VetBiz and SBA and found zero results. 

9.	Other facts:  None

10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  None

11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  The enduser and contracting officer conducted market research and posted an intent to sole source in advance and received zero results. 

12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

<DESC>JOFOC FOR GERSTEL, Inc.
<p>Contracting Without Full and Open Competition<br />Justification and Approvals<br />(Reference FAR 13.106-1(b))</p>
<p>1. Agency: United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Analytical Services and Quality Assurance, ESC, Fort Meade, Md. 20755-5350<br />Contracting Activity: Contracts Branch, Region III<br />Contractor: Gerstel, Inc.</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or description of the action:</p>
<p>This JOFOC is for purchase of a GERSTEL Automated Dynamic Headspace DHS for Chemical Warfare Agent analysis.</p>
<p>3. Description of the Supplies or Services:<br /><br />GERSTEL Automated Dynamic Headspace DHS package includes: <br />Manual TDU Bundle for Agilent 7890 GC<br />Thermal Desorption Unit for CIS 4C<br />Maestro Software - TDU Bundle License<br />Supply kit for TDU/CIS 4C<br />GERSTEL ATEX-TDU Bundle Cooling Option 1Consists of:<br />LN2 cooling for CIS 4C with C506 controller<br />Universal Peltier Cooling for TDU<br />LN2 Dewar Adapter<br />GERSTEL Automatic Tube Exchange (ATEX) Option for GERSTEL MPS 2<br />Dynamic Headspace Option for MPS 2. Allows packed TDU tubes to be used for automated dynamic headspace extraction.<br />TDU tubes packed with Tenax TA, Conditioned, Package.<br />Software must integrate with existing LECO Pegasus&reg; HT TOFMS instrument and the ChromaTOF&reg; operation software.<br />GERSTEL Twister License<br />MPS or TDS/TDU Maintenance &amp; Applications Training Course<br />Installation/Shipping</p>
<p>4. Authority:</p>
<p>Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 41 USC 253(c1).<br /><br />5. Describe how the contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:</p>
<p>This equipment/technology will be used to analyze for Chemical Warfare Agents. In an on-going development of analytical methods for Chemical Warfare Agent analysis this technology will aid us in increasing sample throughput. Gerstel is the only manufacturer of this technology that will work with our current Gerstel MPS prep-station operated by the Maestro auto-sampler control software. Gerstel's Maestro software is designed to integrate seamlessly with our current instrumentation, LECO Pegasus&reg; HT TOFMS instrument and the ChromaTOF&reg; operation software. The combination of these two technologies will enable our laboratory to increase sample throughput.</p>
<p>In summary, purchasing the Gerstel Automated Dynamic Headspace DHS will increase the productivity and efficiency for our lab, which therefore represents the best value for the government.</p>
<p>6. Describe the efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable:</p>
<p>Gerstel is the only manufacturer of this technology that will work with our current Gerstel MPS prep-station operated by the Maestro auto-sampler control software. There is another Dynamic Headspace unit but this unit uses technology that would not be inter-changeable with our Gerstel MPS prep-station and LECO Pegasus&reg; HT TOFMS instrument. Also it is a complete auto-sampler which would not allow us to use the current Gerstel MPS prep-station causing the loss of liquid injection into the LECO Pegasus&reg; HT TOFMS instrument which is its primary form of sample injection.</p>
<p>7. Description of the market research conducted (see FAR Part 10). <br />No market research was compiled due to the special nature of the task that this equipment is intended to do. Explanation is given in question number 6.</p>
<p>8. Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>The Gerstel sales and services office is located in Maryland very close to our lab so repair calls should be quick. Gerstel also has 24/7 help lines for any software/hardware issues free of charge, even after the warranty period has expired. Extended service contracts or per call services are available if needed. <br /><br />9. List sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. If no sources expressed an interest in writing, indicate such.</p>
<p>No sources have expressed an interest in writing.</p>
