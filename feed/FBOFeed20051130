<DESC>NOTICE TO INTENT - to procure "Nutra Plus" fish food produced by Nutreco Canada Inc., Vancouver, Canada, for the Creston National Fish Hatchery, Kalispell, Montana.  This diet meets all of the following performance and quality factors required for the Westslope Cutthroat Trout: Disease protection provided by an immuno stimulant additive; pigments that add brilliant coloration to the fish; pounds gained ratio resulting in vastly improved conversion over the past 2 years compared with other diets; low feed conversion for notably improved water quality; and reduction in pin heading due to the palatable feed with higher protein levels for dramatic growth improvement rates.  Pellets and crumbles in selected sizes shall be delivered every few weeks in accordance with the established delivery schedule.  Any interested parties must submit technical capabilities, pricing and other information that demonstrates its ability to meet the Government needs.  This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available.  No purchase order will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis services for: A Cross-sectional biomarker Study of Workers Exposed to Trichloroethylene (TCE) and Formaldehyde in China, with Guangdong Poison Control Center, 68 Hai Kang Street Xin Gang Road West, Guangzhou, China 5103300.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees. The procurement will be processed in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures stated in FAR Part 13.   

TCE is a volatile chlorinated organic compound and is most commonly used in industrial settings as a general-purpose solvent for lipophilic compounds, as well as for the removal of grease from machinery. Because of its widespread use in addition to industrial discharges and leaching from hazardous waste sites, TCE has become a ubiquitous environmental contaminant in the United States. It has been estimated that more than 400,000 workers may be exposed to TCE annually in the United States. About 10% of the US population has detectable levels of TCE in their blood.   The NCI is planning a cross-sectional molecular epidemiology study of workers exposed to TCE in China to evaluate its genotoxicity and to help evaluate the biologic plausibility that TCE may cause hematopoietic malignancy.  The specific objectives of this procurement is to recruit an additional 30 workers who have been exposed to low levels of TCE (5-25 ppm), 30 additional workers who have been exposed to high levels of formaldehyde (1-3 ppm), 30 unexposed controls, assess TCE and formaldehyde exposure patterns, collect urine and blood samples, collect information on potential confounders, determine lymphocyte subsets for each subject, and culture peripheral blood progenitor cells for the 30 formaldehyde-exposed workers and the 30 controls.  This service is in conjunction with a study that is currently being carried out, in collaboration with investigators from the Guangdong Branch, National Poison Control Center, China.  

The Guangdong Poison Control Center is the only institute authorized to supervise biomarker studies of workers with occupational toxic exposures including TCE in Guangdong Province. Guangdong Poison Control Center’s principal investigators’ are experts in the treatment and prevention of occupational diseases. They have wide connections with factories in Guangdong Province that have various occupational exposures, and have extensive experience carrying out biomarker studies of workers exposed to known or suspected toxins. Guangdong Poison Control Center is the only source known to the NCI that have investigators authorized to work on the study.  

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST on December 14, 2005.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.   Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) in order to receive an award.  Please reference NCI-60012-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>USAID/Colombia, Office of Democracy and Governance, anticipates award of a three year contract with options for two-one year extensions for the Judicial Reform and Modernization Program. The  JRMP will support Colombian judiciary initiatives to be more independent, effective and transparent. This new effort will include results areas to broaden, deepen and build on justice sector reform achievements to date, while responding to new challenges and opportunities to strengthen the GOC justice system. The program will also broaden access to justice through an array of initiatives offering free and timely access to legal services for millions of economically or socially disenfranchised, violence impacted and/or geographically marginalized Colombians.

Four lower level USAID Intermediate Results (IR) areas are anticipated within the JRMP. They are:      

o	IR 1.1.1:  Effective National Implementation of the new Criminal Procedures (Accusatory System) Reform (CPAR); 

o	IR 1.1.2:  Strengthened Court Administration and Management (CAM); 

o	IR 1.1.3:  Increased Access to Justice (ATJ ); and

o	    IR 1.1.4:  - Enhanced Civil Society Roles in Justice Reform and Modernization (CS-JRM).    

For all of the above, assistance will be emphasized in extending justice services to rural, conflict affected, and marginalized populations.

In addition to the above, the USAID program should also be programmatically positioned and structured for possible implementation of an additional future Program Modifier (contingency) intermediate result; implementation of the Justice and Peace Law. This program modifier would be implemented only if future programmatic authorization and additional funding is provided for implementation of the Justice and Peace Law.  

The estimated ceiling amount of the contract is not to exceed $20.5 million. The Contingency Modifier shall not exceed $2 million. 

The RFP will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fbo.gov) not less than 15 days after this notice is issued. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d) availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. No phone requests will be accepted, no RFPs will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed. Questions must be directed by e-mail to Olga Vallejo, ovallejo@usaid.gov and Sunil Xavier, sxavier@usaid.gov .

<DESC>The purpose of this Presolicitation Notice is to change the NAICS Code from 339999 to 336419 on Reference Number N00019-05-PR-8WAUW.  Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract modification for SSGN compatible hardware kits and the effort required to install the kits on new production Composite Capsule Launching System (CCLS) capsules and retrofit existing CCLS capsules.  Upon completion of installation and/or retrofit, these capsules will be compatible with the SSGN submarine Multiple All-Up-Round (AUR) Canister (MAC).  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Systems Company (RSC), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, Arizona 85734-1337.  Raytheon is the only company capable of performing this effort and was awarded a CCLS production contract in June 2005.  Since 1994, RSC has been the sole developer, designer and manufacturer for the Tomahawk AUR.  RSC solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk Block IV missile.  RSC currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tactical Tomahawk missile is required to perform this upgrade to the CCLS, RSC is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice for Solicitation W52P1J-05-R-0046.  Estimated issue date is 14 December 2005 and estimated closing date is 18 January 2006.   Item: the refurbishment and manufacture of PA125 metal containers used for packaging 25mm training ammunition, NSN: 8140-01-347-8121, Part Number:1 2576143.  The PA125 container is a metal, rectangular container with an overall length of 14.340 inches, an overall width of 5.700 inches, and an overall height of 13.870 inches.  Along with the container, the contractor will provide refurbished and/or new  internal container components with each refurbished or new container, including: rubber gasket, filler pads, plastic restraining plate, and plastic separator assembly.  Refurbishment: The contractor will be responsible for retrieving and storing field-ret urned PA125 metal containers from approximately 20 posts, camps and stations located throughout the United States.  The contractor shall inspect the field-returned PA125 metal containers and internal components to determine the degree of rework required fo r reuse and refurbishment.  Manufacture: Should the number of refurbished containers not meet the Governments requirements for PA125 containers, the contractor will be responsible for manufacturing new containers.  A CD is available from the contract spec ialist which contains the complete PA125 Tech Data Package (TDP) including all of the internal components. This RFP is being issued as a 100% small business set aside and will result in a five-year, firm-fixed-price contract.  Because the exact number of c ontainers needed over the next five years is not known, the Government will be awarding a Requirements contract.  A First Article Test will be required.

This synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), for a firm fixed type contract incorporating provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisitions Circular 2005-05. The Operational Contracting Wing at Hill AFB Utah will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

 

(1) Price

 

The above criteria will be used to evaluate offers from contractors. Relative importance will be evaluated in decending order. The best value determination is based on a combination of cost and non-cost factors, including: price, past performance, technical capabilities and past experience with like requirements. These factors will be evaluated at random and without weighting. 

 

Options(if applicable): The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

 

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>Modification 3 to Pre-solicitation Notice MCC-06-RFP-0007

The Pre-solicitation Notice (Revision 2) published 11-18-2005 has the following changes.  

The response deadline is unchanged and remains 12-7-2005 for Track 1 responses and for Track 2 the deadline remains 12-14-2005.  

The time for receipt of questions has expired.

In preparing responses, attention is also directed to Responses to Questions Received through 11-20-2005 and Response #2 to Questions Received through 11-25-2005 (Part 1) posted to this notice.

Please note that Responses to Questions Received through 11-25-2005 (Part 2) will be posted on/about 12-1-2005.

The following changes are made to the Pre-solicitation Notice.  (For ease of reading, the Pre-solicitation Notice Revision of 11-18-05 has been updated and entitled “Pre-solicitation Notice (Revision 3)” and reprinted in entirety under upload Revision 3.)

A.	Page 1, Description, delete the two paragraphs in their entirety and replace with the following:

The MCC requires professional technical services to provide assessments and evaluations of infrastructure projects which are candidates for funding by MCC.  Included in these services may be a range of engineering services and other consulting services in connection with the development, assessment, monitoring, and evaluation of infrastructure projects in developing countries to be evaluated and funded by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC).  
B.	Section 1, “Contract Information”, delete the first paragraph and replace with the following:

Multiple Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards are anticipated under three (3) focuses  (1) infrastructure sub-sector(s), (2) geographic region(s), and (3) competency areas(s) (see Project Information below), each with a base year and four one-year options.  However, MCC reserves the right to make awards based on infrastructure “sub” sub-sectors and/or competency areas(s).  There may be some IDIQ awards for a wide range of coverage and others which provide a narrower but specialized combination of services.  
   
The government may exercise option periods unilaterally.     
Firms will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.     Performance will be authorized through the competitive award of individual task orders each of which will have a specific scope and period of performance.    
Professional Technical Services EXCLUDING architect-engineering services will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 15.  Professional Technical Services INCLUDING architect-engineering services will be procured in accordance with Brooks Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.    Firms may receive IDIQ contract awards for both professional technical services including and excluding A-E services.  
Task Orders (TOs), as issued, may or may not include architect-engineering (A-E) services.  When issued, TOs will clearly state whether A-E services are included in the Statement of Work.  Competition under TOs containing A-E services will be restricted to those IDIQ contractors whose contracts are awarded in accordance with FAR Subpart 36.6.
C.	Section 1, “Contract Information”, delete the sixth paragraph and replace with the following:

This announcement is open to ALL qualified firms; the IDIQ award is NOT a small business set-aside.  Considering this acquisition is being conducted for future, unspecified services which will result from current and future MCC candidate infrastructure projects, professional technical services actually purchased may fall in any number or combination of North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code(s) under Category 54-Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.  However, it is anticipated that the preponderance of task order services will include engineering services classified under NAICS code 541330.  
For business size classification only, under the IDIQ award, business size will be based on the NAICS code which best describes the general nature of the services provided by the firm.  Firms may determine their business size by going to https://eweb1.sba.gov/naics/dsp_naicssearch2.cfm.  Based on the array of contractor business sizes under the IDIQ awards, the MCC may determine, on a task-order-by-task-order basis, to set aside competition under a specific task order for participation by qualified small business contractors.  The size determination of small business, in this instance, will be based on the NAICS code assigned to the task order.
D.	Section 1, “Contract Information”, delete the eighth paragraph.  It has been incorporated under Section 3, “Selection Evaluation Factors and Sub-factors”, the revised paragraph 4.

E.	Section 2, “Project Information”, the following language is inserted at the end:

2.5	Security

The Contractor shall be SOLELY responsible for providing background investigations on ALL personnel who are assigned in the performance of any/all work done under individual task orders, as well as paying the cost of background investigations.  Work cannot begin on a task order until the requirements stated here and below are met.

The work performed under this contract shall only be accomplished by individuals (in the employment of the Contractor or any Subcontractors) whose conduct is consistent with applicable security levels, the requirements of this contract, and acceptable to the Contracting Officer (CO) in conjunction with the MCC Security Office. 

The risk/sensitivity level designation of the activities performed under this contract will be specified in the individual task order (low/moderate/high risk).  In the event a task order is issued without the risk/sensitivity level designated, the contractor shall provide background investigation commensurate with a high risk level.  The Contractor shall conduct a background investigation of each individual prior to that individual performing work under a task order and affirmatively determine that each individual meets this contract’s minimum standards of acceptability.  The minimum standards of acceptability shall be at least commensurate with the suitability determinations contained in the DOI Departmental Manual Part 441, Chapter 3 which is available on the internet at http://elips.doi.gov/app_home/index.cfm?fuseaction=home or as may be otherwise determined by the MCC Security Office.

In response to a task order, the contractor shall propose only those individuals who have, or are in the position to successfully complete, the required background investigations.  The contractor shall provide to the COTR, within 3 business days after task order award, written confirmation that Contractor/subcontractor personnel under the task order has had the required background investigation and has a favorable determination of their suitability prior to commencement of any work. 
 
For each individual, the written confirmation will include a listing providing the individual’s full name, date of birth, place of birth, social security number (except for foreign contractors not issued a number) and home address.  In addition, the contractor will provide a central point-of-contact regarding personnel security issues.  The contracting officer will send a copy of the listing and point-of-contact to the MCC Security Office.  It is the MCC Security Office’s responsibility to determine if further information or background investigations are needed.

Contractor personnel shall be reinvestigated by the Contractor (or subcontractor, as appropriate) on a periodic basis; however, at least annually.  

The Contractor shall notify the CO and COTR immediately when its employee is reassigned, or leaves the Contractor’s (subcontractor’s) employ.  Prior notice shall be given to CO and COTR immediately in the case of an unfriendly termination.

In the event of a disagreement between the Contractor and the MCC concerning the suitability of a particular employee to perform work under this contract, the MCC Contracting Officer shall have the right of final determination.  Determinations under this requirement are subject to the Disputes Clause.  Failure of the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this clause would constitute grounds for termination for default.

F.	Section 3, “Selection Evaluation Factors and Sub-factors”, paragraph 4, “Submission Requirements” delete first and third paragraphs and insert the following:

4.        Submission Requirements (Track 1 and Track 2)
A.	For award of contracts allowing competition under task orders for Professional Technical Services INCLUDING architect/engineering services:
Final selection of the most highly qualified firms and negotiation of contract rates will be done in accordance with FAR Part 36.   Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit three (3) copies of responses including SF 330, Parts I and II (GSA Form Library at www.gsa.gov). 
Responses should be submitted considering the instructions on the SF330 and the information requested in this pre-solicitation notice.  Additional sheets and supplemental information may be included; however, unnecessarily elaborate and lengthy supplemental information is discouraged and may reflect that the responding firm does not understand the requirement and the specific information requested.

Considering FAR Subpart 36.6 procedures and that multiple Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards are anticipated under each of the three (3) focuses  (1) infrastructure sub-sector(s), (2) geographic region(s), and (3) competency areas(s), price (labor and burden rate) negotiations will be conducted with firms ranking as highest qualified firms for each focus.  

When work is identified, following award of IDIQ contracts, task order specific services and selection criteria will be provided to the contractors to supplement their SF330s.     The SF330s and supplements will be used to determine the most highly qualified firms. Task Orders will be negotiated with the most preferred firm in accordance with FAR 36.606 after evaluation board review of the IDIQ contractors under the associated focus.

B.	For award of contracts allowing competition under task orders for Professional Technical Services EXCLUDING architect-engineering services:
Responses must be submitted responding to all of the selection evaluation factors and sub-factors provided above.  Responses must be in 2 sections: Technical and Price.  The format of the response is at the discretion of the firm; however, the response must clearly present the firm’s capabilities, capacity, and past performance  for evaluation.  Evaluation will be based solely on the information presented in the response.  
The Technical part shall include the firm’s technical response to this notice.  The Price part shall include the fully burdened direct labor rates for each labor category proposed and any other burdened rate and its application.  
Technical evaluation will be in accordance with the above evaluation factors and sub-factors.  Price evaluation will be performed to determine the reasonableness of each firm’s pricing.  Price evaluation will consider the base and option year rates.  The Government may determine that pricing is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options will not obligate the MCC to exercise the option(s).  
Award will be made to the firm whose submission represents the best value to the MCC.  The MCC will consider price as a factor in the evaluation; however, the non-price evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price. 
Firms wishing to receive awards for professional technical services including AND excluding A-E services MUST submit responses in accordance with paragraph A below.
	C.  General
G.	Section 3, “Selection Evaluation Factors and Sub-factors”, paragraph 4, “Submission Requirements” insert the following at the end of the segment:

RESPONSES MUST BE IN WRITING WITH A CD COPY.  Electronic copies may be submitted only in lieu of the CD.  Responses should be labeled with the solicitation number; date and time specified in the notice for receipt of response; and name, address, and telephone number of the firm.  

Include in the response, preferably the cover letter, the name and title of the person authorized to conduct discussions with MCC on behalf of the firm and an alternate; and, if different, name of person authorized to commit the company.  For each individual include their DIRECT mailing addresses, voice/fax numbers, AND email addresses.  During evaluations the primary initial method of communications will be through email.  Please also include the firm’s business size/socio-economic status and acknowledgment of the pre-solicitation modifications; notices; and responses to questions.

The firms agree to hold the technical and price sections of response firm for a minimum of 60 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of responses.

H.	Section 3, “Selection Evaluation Factors and Sub-factors”, Track 2 the following italicized word changes are made:

Track 2 evaluations will be conducted separately from Track 1 evaluations.  Award of the multiple IDIQ contracts under Track 2 will be made upon conclusion of evaluations and rate negotiations.  ……

Note: Upon conclusion of IDIQ awards under Track 2, firms receiving awards under  both or either Track 1 and Track 2 will equally participate in competitive task order award activities within their respective award focus.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to the notice entitled Independent and Objective Support in Aeronautical and Space Systems Engineering (posted on October 27, 2005) is to revise the notice to specify that the estimated level of effort of approximately 10 staff members per year is to be provided on site.  The notice otherwise remains unchanged.

The original notice (as revised by this modification) follows:

The National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS) of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is conducting market research for the purposes of identifying sources who have demonstrated capabilities in the area of aeronautical and space systems engineering. No solicitation of offers is made by this 
synopsis.

NOAA/NESDIS is dedicated to providing timely access to global 
environmental data from satellites and other sources to promote, 
protect, and enhance the Nation’s economy, security, environment, and quality of life. To fulfill its responsibilities, NESDIS acquires and manages the Nation’s operational environmental satellites, provides data, and information services, and conducts related research. 
NESDIS manages NOAA’s operational geostationary and polar-orbiting environmental satellite programs. NOAA/NESDIS’ objective is to provide the spacecraft, launch services, and ground systems necessary to maintain the uninterrupted flow of remotely-sensed environmental data required to promote, protect, and enhance the Nation’s economy, security, environment, and quality of life.  Further information regarding the requirements of this program can be found at the following web site: http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov.

NESDIS is seeking an organization to provide independent and objective support over the next five years in architecture planning development, acquisition support, systems development, operations support, and assessments of technology opportunities and alternatives for future and current satellite programs as well as domestic and foreign commercial satellite technology and policy implementation.  Because of the nature of these services, they are needed from an organization who will not experience significant organizational conflicts of interest from any analysis and recommendations in support of the agency mission. 

Currently, NOAA/NESDIS is acquiring these services as the result of a sole source acquisition with the MITRE Corporation pursuant to 41 USC 253 (c)(1) and has done so for the past eleven years. If based on the results of this sources sought and the evaluation of any capability statement(s) submitted in response to this synopsis, it is determined that there are no other qualified sources, this synopsis will serve as the notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with the MITRE Corporation and will meet the publication requirements of a proposed sole source award.  

In support of this NESDIS requirement, any resultant contract would have an estimated period of performance for the base contract of one year with four one-year options for a total of five years (inclusive of options). The two primary tasks under any resultant contract would be for support of the National Polar-orbiting and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite Systems). The Government estimates the following 
level of effort per year: 4,081 senior professional, 15,360 
professional, and 1,068 technical and administrative for approximately 10 staff members per year to be provided on site (based on an estimated 1,920 productive person year).

The Contractor will be required to provide qualified management, personnel, organizational structure, procedural and administration functions to effectively and efficiently manage the work performed under any contract. Interested offerors having the specialized capabilities to meet the above requirements should submit a capability statement of 15 pages or less within forty-five days of the publication of this announcement. In addition to addressing organizational conflicts of interest, the capability statement should address the organization’s ability to support all aspects of the aforementioned technical capabilities, and specifically address the following:

Describe relevant organizational experiences in performance and management of Research and Development in the area of aeronautical and space systems engineering and in defining and developing current and next generation operational environmental satellite systems. Reference and provide detailed examples of work in the technical areas listed above.

Detail relevant organizational experiences for contracts with multiple tasks and/or projects and include average number of tasks/year managed.

Identify the credentials of key staff members, their contributions on other similar projects, and their availability to any resultant contract.

Detail relevant organizational experience with confidential and sensitive information and the avoidance of conflicts of interests (as noted above).

In addition to addressing technical capabilities, responses must include the following: name and address of firm, size of business (i.e., large, small, small disadvantaged business, woman owned, etc.); average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture 
partners, potential teaming partner’s, prime contractor (if potential subcontractor) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; point of contact - address and phone number), and list any existing Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACS) for which you are currently qualified.

Telephone responses are NOT solicited. No solicitation exists; 
therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract nor will the Government pay for information solicited.

Responses to this notice shall be mailed to the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO), SSMC3 - Room 10100/OFA64, 1305 East West Highway, 10th Floor, Silver Spring, MD 20910 Attn: Marilyn B. Whaley, Contracting 
Officer. Telephone and/or e-mail responses will not be accepted. 
Responses must be received in the AGO in writing no later than 3:00PM Eastern Standard Time on December 12, 2005.  NAICS Code:  927110 -- Space Research and Technology.  Reference Numbered Note 22.

<SOLNBR>0106RP39559
<RESPDATE>123005
<ARCHDATE>11302006
<CONTACT>Olivia Adrian Contract Specialist 7037871152     Olivia.Adrian@mms.gov;
<DESC>This announcement solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program on Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  However, the last topic of this announcement will be provided to the MMS Environmental Studies Program (ESP) for review. This initiative is entitled "White Papers Sought for Proposed Research on Hurricanes Katrina and Rita -- Impact in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GOM)".  The MMS web sites for TAR and ESP have descriptions of past hurricane projects.  When appropriate, the research shall be conducted consistently with prior hurricane research.  The web site addresses are http://www.mms.gov/tarsafety/ for TAR and  http://www.mms.gov/offshore/EnvironmentalResearch.htm for ESP.  BACKGROUND:   During the hurricane season of 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita moved through the GOM with extreme winds and large waves exceeding or matching the 100-year design criteria of the facilities in its path.  MMS plans to analyze and assess the consequential damage to structures and pipelines from these storms.  As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested.  Projects selected for eventual funding by MMS shall receive funding from FY 2006 supplemental funding. THE MMS ANTICIPATES THAT $1,000,000 - $1,500,000 MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR THE INITIATION OF NEW RESEARCH PROPOSALS ADDRESSING HURRICANES KATRINA AND RITA TOPICS WITH PROJECTS BEING IDENTIFIED THROUGH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  SOME PROJECTS TO ADDRESS THE TOPICS SET FORTH BELOW MAY REQUIRE UP TO $250,000 PER PROJECT TO COMPLETE WITH ESTIMATES FOR TOPIC 6 TO REQUIRE UP TO $500,000 and prospective offerors shall bear this in mind when responding to this request.  NOTICE:  The MMS may share the White Papers with other organizations for review.   Potential contractors shall notify the MMS if they do not want their white papers/proposals shared.      OBJECTIVES: The proposed topics for hurricanes Katrina and Rita activities should be limited to the following:  1.  Assess and evaluate pipeline movement/damage caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  In areas where similar conditions exist, compare instances of movement/damage against non-movement/damage to determine whether lessons for pipeline design, installation, and maintenance may be learned. 2.

•Assess status of the newest technologies in real-world service.
•Establish a benchmark of current and near-term technologies.
•Share lessons learned about implementation experience.

Evaluation projects on prototype vehicles focus on the commercialization process and progress--in other words, a technology assessment. Most evaluations include economic, technical, emissions, and safety factors. Data are collected on the operation, maintenance, performance, and, sometimes, the emissions characteristics of advanced technology fleets and comparable diesel fleets (if available) operating at the same site. Operators considering the use of these advanced vehicles comprise the primary intended audience for this information. Information provided through these evaluations will help fleet owners and operators facilitate purchase decisions on new technologies. Results from the evaluations of pre-commercial technologies also feed back into the development process for DOE and technology manufacturers. 

NREL is seeking an organization with expertise in working with various project partners to collect and analyze data on advanced technology vehicles. To support NREL with this effort, an organization must document specific capabilities, attributes, and skills as indicated:

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is seeking potential sources for the continued demonstration and evaluation of the Airborne Infrared Surveillance (AIRS) capability in support of the MDA Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  This effort utilizes an electro-optic/infrared sensor designed, developed and integrated into the host aircraft by the incumbent L-3 Communications, Aeromet Division.  The sensor is hosted on a Gulfstream II aircraft operated by L-3/Aeroment and is used as a test asset for data collection by the MDA.  The aircraft/sensor combination is called the High Altitude Observatory (HALO) II.  The key technical capabilities requiring further demonstration and evaluation are:  1) cued and autonomous search, detection, and acquisition; 2) real-time missile tracking and 3-D state vector generation; 3) real-time discrimination of object(s) of interest; and 4) real-time connectivity with  MDA’s Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) system.

The effort will include data collection, analyses and potential modification of the sensor suite mounted on the HALO II aircraft.  The HALO II sensor suite will be used to collect infrared surveillance data against targets of interest to the MDA.  This data will be processed in real time on board the HALO II to form state vectors and object sighting messages to be downlinked to the MDA C2BMC system as fire control solutions.  The required effort consists of detailed test planning, engineering evaluations, minor modifications, and experiments and demonstrations for the HALO II aircraft and its support equipment.  

Credible potential sources would require the capability to perform the following:
1. Systems engineering to develop designs to integrate improvements to the MDA airborne test assets that facilitate real time in-flight demonstrations of key BMDS capabilities.  
2. Develop and maintain software for sensor data processing and target tracking.
3. Investigate, demonstrate, and evaluate target identification feature extraction, discrimination, and tracking algorithms.
4. Demonstrate connectivity to MDA’s C2BMC system.  
5. Upgrade the communications system on HALO II and other airborne assets.

The potential value for the continued design, development and evaluation of the AIRS system could be $10M per year for a five-year project depending on future technology decisions.  The incumbent Contractor is L-3 Communications, Aeromet Division.  

Interested parties are invited to submit a capability statement, not to exceed three (3) pages to this synopsis’ points-of-contact by no later than 15 days from the date this synopsis is published.  The capability statement must summarize the respondent’s strengths in relationship to the following criteria:
1.   Describe the qualification and capability to perform the type of work specified above.
2.   Describe present or recent experience with DoD and / or NASA for the type of work specified above.
If planning to team or subcontract, identify the firm(s) and segregate the information on the capability statement by firm.

THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR AWARD A CONTRACT.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS.

<SUBJECT>A -- The Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGR) Trial: Clinical Sites
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NICHD-DESPR-2006-02
<RESPDATE>121605

<DESC>Background:  Despite the fundamental nature of reproduction, for many it is a process fraught with frustration, inefficiency and imperfections, the effects of which can be severe. Infertility affects ten to 15 percent of couples attempting to conceive. Among all women who conceive, the incidence of spontaneous abortion has been estimated to be between 15 and 31 percent, and in many cases the cause is unknown. Additionally, of the four million births yearly in the United States, between eight and 15 percent will be born prematurely and experience increased morbidity and mortality as a result.  An intervention with even a small absolute effect on any of these outcomes has great implications at the population level because of the large potential attributable benefit.

Reproduction is a multi-stage process, and irregularities at any of these phases may be a sufficient cause of, or contribute to, negative outcomes.  Aspirin diminishes inflammation, increases vasodilation, and inhibits platelet aggregation.  It has been prescribed to subfertile or infertile women to improve outcomes at various stages of reproduction. Aspirin treatment for infertility has been shown to improve perfusion and increase endometrium thickness. In vitro fertilization (IVF) trials have suggested improved rates of implantation and pregnancies among women assigned to preconception aspirin supplementation compared with placebo. There are conflicting results among those with recurrent miscarriage.  Evidence supports aspirin treatment among women with anti-phospholipids antibody syndrome. In women with idiopathic recurrent miscarriage syndrome, some studies have observed a treatment benefit while others have been inconclusive.  In studies of women with normal pregnancies and women at increased risk for preeclampsia, aspirin therapy starting at 12 weeks’ gestation has been shown to reduce preterm delivery, with a higher gestational age at birth among infants of those taking aspirin than placebo. 
	
The promising evidence in the IVF literature suggesting improved fecundity has been generated by studies too small to determine effects on pregnancy endpoints.  Larger studies of high-risk women not using assisted reproductive technologies (ART) have begun treatment at 12 weeks’ gestation at the earliest, with some starting as late as 37 weeks.  It is unclear whether improved perfusion and blood flow early in pregnancy will improve pregnancy outcomes through reduction of early and late fetal losses, as well as improving fetal development. 

The NICHD is planning to conduct a trial to evaluate the effect of low-dose daily aspirin on reproduction at all phases beginning at preconception and continuing throughout pregnancy.   The trial will assess the effects of aspirin on each of these phases, including implantation and live births. 

Scope:  The trial will be a multi-site randomized controlled trial study design to achieve study objectives with four Clinical Sites and one Data Coordinating Center. Women aged 18 to 40 years, currently trying to become pregnant, and who have had a single spontaneous abortion in the past year will be eligible for the study. The overall for the trial recruitment goal is approximately 2000 women. Participating women will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, treatment or placebo. Those randomized to treatment will receive daily low-dose aspirin (LDA). Those randomized to placebo will receive daily placebo.  Both groups will receive folic acid daily in accordance with recommendations from the U.S. Public Health Service for prevention of birth defects. The duration of treatment regimens (LDA and folic acid or placebo and folic acid) will be two menstrual cycles, with those who become pregnant continuing until the end of pregnancy.
	
Study participants will be followed for the outcomes, including ovulation, determined using fertility monitors, implantation, and early pregnancy loss; clinically-recognized pregnancy, determined by presence of a fetal heartbeat from ultrasound scans; clinically-recognized spontaneous abortion; and information on stillbirth, gestational age, fetal growth, birth defects, and cesarean section. 
	
Samples collected that are not tested as part of the current protocol will be used to generate a specimen repository. The study population may be used as a cohort for future studies utilizing these samples and other information collected during the course of the study. 

Objective:  The primary objective of the trial is to help elucidate the effects of low-dose aspirin in combination with folic acid on the incidence of live births among those women who become pregnant relative to the placebo arm.
	
The effects of aspirin on uterine blood flow are expected to improve not only live birth rates, but also implantation, and to enhance retention of implanted trophoblasts.  Accordingly, the trial has the additional goals of evaluating the effects of aspirin therapy on various outcomes. Specifically, the NICHD plans to evaluate the effect of low-dose aspirin in combination with folic acid treatment on incidence of hCG detected pregnancy, early loss of pregnancy, and on pregnancy outcomes.

Due to the population prevalence of early pregnancy loss, as well as of pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight, study findings have the potential to have great impact if even small effects are observed. 


To be deemed capable to serve as a Clinical Site for the trial, a small business must submit a written capability statement that clearly demonstrates the ability to:  
1) recruit at least 400 women in 30 months that experienced no more or no less than one spontaneous abortion in the previous 12 months and are actively trying to get pregnant, not using contraception, and have a current male partner; 
2) administrate the treatment and follow subjects for outcomes to study the effect of low-dose aspirin in combination with folic acid on the incidence of live births and other reproductive outcomes among those with hCG detected pregnancy relative to folic acid alone; 
3) store, retrieve, and transport information and biological specimens; 
4) create a repository of urine and serum samples for future evaluation and collect and maintain of the above mentioned records and DNA-containing samples; 
5) produce, maintain, and ensure the quality of large data files.

AT THIS TIME THE NICHD IS ONLY REQUESTING CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM SMALL BUSINESSES.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.   The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541710.  Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is 500 employees or less.  See http://www.sba.gov/size/ for information on what is a small business and part 121.106 of the SBA's Small Business Size Regulations on how the SBA calculates number of employees.

Small Businesses that meet the applicable size standard and believe that they have the capabilities described above are encouraged to submit a written Capability Statement to attention of Charles Newman, Contracting Officer, at the address provided by 3:00 PM Local Time on December 16, 2005.  The Capability Statement should be limited to no more than 15 pages and it should address each of the competencies stated above.  If responses indicate a reasonable expectation of obtaining competitive offers from two or more responsible and capable small business concerns, the anticipated subsequent Request for Proposals will be set-aside or partially set-aside for small businesses.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC) and Product Manager Radars is conducting a market survey.  This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only; this not a Request for Quotations or Propos als. No solicitation document exists and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI.  The Government will not be liable for payment of any response preparation expenses.  Interested parties are  responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government is of the opinion that the evolution of the Enhanced-Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (E-LCMR) system to the A-LCMR is a minor  endeavor and that the program is ready for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) of approximately seven (7) systems.  The Government is issuing this RFI to obtain information from industry which would permit a feasibility assessment of achieving the A-LCMR p erformance thresholds as set forth in the SOCOM Operational Requirements Document (adopted by the Army and approved by TRADOC) and its Annex A, the A-LCMR draft Specification and the draft Statement of Work.  Your input will assist the Government in determ ining the best acquisition strategy for accomplishing Low Rate Initial Production within the cost and schedule constraints identified herein.  All interested parties with significant past performance experience in designing, producing and/or sustaining rad ar systems are encouraged to respond to this RFI by providing the following information on or before 2:00 PM on 19 December 2005:  feasibility of achieving the performance thresholds within the cost and schedule constraints identified below; identify progr ammatic and technological risks associated with a program of this nature along with any potential risk mitigation strategies for same; identify any key performance objectives that are considered to be cost or schedule drivers; and, any budgetary estimates that may be releasable to help assess the reasonableness of affordability constraints described herein.  Responses to this RFI must be unclassified and should not exceed 40 pages in length.   Specifically, the Government seeks industrys opinion regarding the following:  The E-LCMR System is currently in prototype production by Syracuse Research Corporation and the Government believes that the system will: Demonstrate a Range and Accuracy Performance in an Actual Environment of 60m TLE (Target Location Error) (50% CEP [Circular Error Probability]) out to 6km on 60mm Mortars. Demonstrate a Range and Accuracy Performance in an Actual Environment of 60m TLE (50% CEP) out to 8km on 81mm Mortars.  Demonstrate a Range and Accuracy Performance in an Actual Environment of 75m TLE (50% CEP) out to 10km on 120mm Mortars. Q:  Can you demonstrate E-LCMR functionality today?  If yes, can you grow that system to meet the A-LCMR requirements and start delivery of 20 systems per month in 6 months?  Is this delivery achievable and, if not, describe in detail your recommended sche dule and number of systems per month. Q:  Given the state of the current E-LCMR, whats the extent of design and/or development that you envision to meet the A-LCMR requirements?  Describe in detail. The Government desires to initiate this program at Milestone C, Production and Deployment and is seeking industry input as to the feasibility of doing so. Other considerations:  Armys requirement is 416 systems; target unit production cost is $ 800,000.00; multiple awards could be made; government desires accelerated production and delivery; reduced logistics footprint; how and when to conduct Initial Produ ction Tests; Government insists on full technical data rights; sustainment and support of all systems (both existing fielded and yet to be fielded); retrofit of existing systems to the A-LCMR configuration; tradeoffs required to meet  desired Key Performance Parameters (KPPs).   Responses may be sent to PM Radars, ATTN:  SFAE-IEW&S-NV-R, J. Scott Allen, J.S.Allen@us.army.mil, Building 428, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5000.  A copy of all submittals shall also be posted electronically to the C-E LCMC Interactive Business Opportunity Pa ge at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil under solicitation W15P7T-06-R-M214. The A-LCMR documents referenced above have been posted into a document library under the above referenced solicitation.  These documents contain information that has been designated as Militarily Critical Technical Data. Only businesses that have been cert ified by the Department of Defense, United States/Canada Joint Certification Office, and have a valid requirement may obtain access into the document library.

<SUBJECT>A -- The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases seeks Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) collaborators for NAFLD, NASH & cryptogenic cirrhosis clinical trials
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) seeks collaborators for Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) to (1) evaluate a panel of serological assays that reflect hepatic fibrosis, inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress to differentiate among NAFLD, NASH, or cryptogenic cirrhosis, (2) identify protein alterations in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or cryptogenic cirrhosis, (3) evaluate noninvasive imaging methods for assessing fat, inflammation, disease activity and/or fibrosis in NASH including but not limited to the use of elastrography, nuclear magnetic resonance, molecular imaging, and (4) provide S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) to perform a randomized controlled trial of therapy of NASH and/or cryptogenic cirrhosis.

The NAFLD Database study ¡V A prospective database of adult and pediatric cases of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or cryptogenic cirrhosis was created by the NIDDK-funded NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN), which is currently accruing patients, and will ultimately allow prospective evaluation and follow-up of approximately 1,500 patients for 3 years on average.

In addition to the NAFLD Database study, the NASH CRN has developed two treatment trials: (1) PIVENS ¡V to evaluate whether 96 weeks of treatment with either pioglitazone or vitamin E lowers NASH activity as determined from hepatic histology in nondiabetic adults with NASH compared to treatment with placebo, (2) TONIC ¡V to determine whether 96 weeks of treatment with either metformin or vitamin E leads to sustained reduction in serum alanine transferase in nondiabetic children with NAFLD compared to treatment with placebo.  PIVENS is currently recruiting patients and TONIC will begin recruitment by June, 2005.

Ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, imaging studies, and determinants of progression and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease present a variety of opportunities for CRADAs.

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies for a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to provide s-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e) to perform a randomized controlled trial of therapy of cryptogenic cirrhosis.  The NIDDK is also seeking proposals from companies for a CRADA to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, imaging studies, and determinants of progression and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and/or NASH.  Pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company for ancillary studies.  Examples of potential studies include:  1) Exploration of serum markers for fibrosis and serum markers for disease activity to predict hepatic histology either by themselves or in combination with other clinical, laboratory, proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic variables in the NAFLD Database study.  2) Exploration of the utility of these serum markers as surrogate markers of therapeutic response in study subjects participating in adult (PIVENS) and pediatric (TONIC) treatment trials.  3) Evaluation of the role of lipid peroxidation in the pathogenesis of NASH or NAFLD and analysis of the effect of various therapies on the levels of serum peroxides in patients with NASH or NAFLD participating in treatment trials.  4) Develop serum/plasma proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic expression arrays that are diagnostic of fatty liver disease or NASH or cryptogenic cirrhosis and that would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, steatosis and fibrosis in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.  5) Use of cytokine assays for analyses of serum/plasma cytokine levels as markers of necro-inflammatory or fibrotic activity in NAFLD or NASH and as surrogate markers of histologic improvement in therapeutic trials of NAFLD or NASH.  (6) Evaluation of the role of noninvasive imaging methods for assessing fat, inflammation, disease activity and/or fibrosis in NASH.  (7) Investigation of S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) as an antioxidant and therapeutic agent for NASH and/or cryptogenic cirrhosis.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  A CRADA is an agreement designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories.  It is not a grant, and is not a contract for the procurement of goods/services.  The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a CRADA collaborator.  Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort.  The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration.  The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and may make contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA.

STUDY GOAL:  The overall goal of the NASH Clinical Research Network is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with NAFLD or NASH using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy of NAFLD or NASH and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by the NAFLD Database on adult and pediatric patients with NAFLD or cryptogenic cirrhosis including clinical information as well as serum, plasma, liver tissue, and DNA samples.  A description of laboratory tests that are needed including assays and required amount of specimens, to determine specific biomarker levels along with appropriate methods for performing them should be provided, as well as other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.  Also included should be the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  The Steering Committee will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Steering Committee through their capability statements. The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages and should address the following selection criteria:  1. The statement should provide specific details of the methods to be utilized in the investigation of pioglitazone or metformin or vitamin E in patients with NAFLD or NASH and clearly describe important issues surrounding the evaluation of disease progression in these patients.  2. The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the laboratory test agents in a timely manner for the duration of the study.  3. The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator.  The specifics of the proposed outcome measures and the proposed support should include but not be limited to treatment and evaluation of NAFLD or NASH or cryptogenic cirrhosis, specific funding commitment to support the advancement of scientific research, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, or other resources that would contribute to the conduct of the commercial development.  4. The statement must address willingness to promptly publish research results and ability to be bound by PHS intellectual property policies (see CRADA: http://ott.od.nih.gov/newpages/crada.pdf).

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costa that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The AJNR course investigates the intricacies of interior gateway protocol (IGP) operation through OSPF and IS-IS labs that engage the student in a detailed examination of the link-state database and the effects of virtually all protocol options. The complexities of large-scale routing using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) are then explored, with the focus placed on scaling networks using route reflection and confederations. In addition, numerous BGP options, such as multihop, multipath, and authentication, are discussed and configured in a lab setting. The class moves on to cover advanced JUNOS software features relating to MPLS and traffic engineering. In these sections the student is exposed to detailed discussions of RSVP and LDP signaling. Additional topics include CSPF and ERO-based routing constraints, routing table integration options, and traffic protection. The final sections of the course are devoted to a detailed exploration of multicast routing protocols, such as PIM, MSDP, and MBGP, in the context of interdomain multicast topologies that permit the demonstration of advanced multicast configuration options and monitoring.)

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-851) 2100 2nd Street, SW Room 2606 Washington D. C. 20593 Telephone: (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

VENDOR QUESTIONS AND GOVERNMENT RESPONSES

28 NOVEMBER 2005

Vendor Question:  
Attachment # 1. Item 1.1.4:  Note: All facilities will be available from the access times stated above until 0500.
 
    Does this mean the service can be completed anytime between those hours?
 
    For example: A location closes at 1800 hrs. but the service is not scheduled to begin until 2200hrs. How will the gov't provide access to the building at that time?
 

Government Response:
The cleaning must be completed during the access times stated in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  In the example provided above, the vendor will have access to the facility from 2200 to 0500.  The Government does not necessarily anticipate that it would take that entire time to complete the job, but all work must be completed during the hours of 2200 to 0500.

As far as how access is provided, what normally happens is the Quality Control Personnel (QAP) and the Real Property Building Manager (RPBM) will coordinate and setup access to the building to be cleaned.
