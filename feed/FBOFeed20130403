Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies.

When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.

<DESC><strong>This Notice of Intent to Establish a Qualified Supplier List is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.</strong>
<p><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and DLA Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program anticipate issuing a Sources Sought Notification for the establishment of a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Specimen Containers</span> through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website on or about 18 July 2013. This is not a request for quote or proposal.</strong> Examples of items for the QSL could include but are not limited to: Specimen Containers in various sizes, sterile/non-sterile, latex free or latex safe, and single use.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this effort will be to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL. The QSL for Specimen Containers will be the basis of a separate Standardization Action (SA) resulting in an Incentive Agreement (IA). This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in the QSL process vendors must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. Vendors must have a current and active Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<strong> Vendors must update relevant part numbers for this product line in the DAPA Management System with the country from which each line item is an end product, IAW the Trade Agreements Act. Vendors responding to the QSL FBO Announcement will be required to ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line are Trade Agreements compliant.</strong></p>
<p>Detailed information about the QSL requirements will be provided in the QSL FBO Announcement. The purpose of this <strong>Notice of Intent to Establish a Qualified Supplier List </strong>is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the QSL FBO is imminent. Upon issuance of the QSL FBO, all relevant information will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration, Eastern Service Area, is conducting a Market Survey/Request for Information to gain understanding of the current marketplace and to identify responsible, capable sources. Responses to this market survey will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set this requirement aside for Small Businesses.  This survey is being conducted in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1 for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors. .  This survey will be utilized for acquisition planning, as well as to determine if there are any responsible small businesses capable of performing this project.

This Market Survey is for the construction of a new Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility at West Palm Beach International Airport. All responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals at this time. Presently, the nature of the competition has not been determined.  Upon solicitation the FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBAs 8(a) Program.  

All interested vendors are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received in response to this Market Survey. Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey submissions will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.

The FAA is seeking responsible contractors interested in providing Offers for the construction of a new Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility (TRACON) at West Palm Beach International Airport.   The anticipated period of performance is approximately eighteen (18) months.  

SECTION I:  DESCRIPTION OF WORK TO BE PERFORMS:

Project Description:  
The project consists of a single story, precast concrete, 12,000 SF Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) Base Building, modifications to the existing 9,000 SF Airport Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) Base Building to integrate it with the separate function of the new TRACON and all associated site work.
The exterior area of the site shall have a parking lot, sidewalks, landscaping, and a security system to provide facility monitoring from the interior of the existing and new buildings.  Modifications and demolition of existing site elements and utilities associated with the existing ATCT and ATCT Base Building will be necessary to accommodate the new TRACON. The project includes internal systems including fire suppression, security, telephone wiring, and systems furniture.  After occupancy of the new TRACON Base Building the existing ATCT and ATCT Base Building will be cutover to the new TRACONs power system.  At that time the existing power system in the ATCT Base Building must be removed and modifications made to the rooms in the ATCT Base Building that contained the equipment.  

The estimated price range is between $6,500,000.00 and $8,500,000.00.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220.

This market survey will serve as a market analysis to assist the FAA in determining which procurement method to use.  The failure to obtain adequate responses from responsible SBA 8(a) firms or other small businesses may result in the determination to conduct this procurement action under full and open competition.

SECTION II  CAPABILITY STATEMENT:  In order to make this determination the FAA requires the submission of the following information from interested vendors:

<DESC>A--Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for BAA-13-G-01-MOD-01 SUBMARINE ESCAPE, RESCUE, AND DIVER SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS, AS WELL AS DIVING EQUIPMENT Research and Development

POINT OF CONTACT:  Kenneth Eisenberg, Program Manager, (Kenneth.eisenberg@navy.mil) Phone: (202) 781-4921

NOTE:  This BAA replaces BAA-13-G-01-MOD-02

The Navy Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU) is soliciting pre-proposals and proposals for applied Biomedical Research and Diving Equipment Development with a focus on Submarine Escape and Rescue, Diving Safety, and Diving Effectiveness. The goals of this program are presented in more detail below.  It is the intent that this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) be open for a one year period from the date of this publication (or until 2/15/2014).
  However, specified dates are given in paragraph (2) below for submission of pre-proposals and proposals to be awarded within FY 2014.
 
(1) Primary Interests

This program's objectives are to focus on improving or developing diving equipment that can be rapidly transitioned to a fleet capability and researching the biomedical aspects of Submarine Escape, Rescue, and Diver Safety so that procedures can be developed/improved that will increase the levels of safety and effectiveness for Navy personnel.  The typical project will be two years or less although three year projects are considered.

The areas of primary interest in submarine escape and rescue are: (1) development of rapid methods of disabled submarine (DISSUB) atmosphere assessment; (2) development of novel means to manage oxygen toxicity aboard the pressurized disabled submarine; (3) development of novel means to accelerate or eliminate saturation decompression of survivors; including, but not limited to greater oxygen use and perfluorocarbon (PFC) administration; (4) assuring survival in a disabled submarine (DISSUB) for seven days by evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of present life support stores.
 Improved Guard Book guidance and procedures,  utility of medication to reduce the metabolic rate of the crew; impact of starvation, dehydration, sleep deprivation and nitrogen narcosis at 5ATA on decision making and ability to carry out Guard Book directed survival actions and escape; (5) improving understanding and guidance for thermal stress in a disabled submarine by development and evaluation of heat stress curves for time and/or conditions to escape; heat mitigation measures (body cooling) in conditions of increased temperature and elevated CO2 (2.5 - 3%); (6) improving understanding and guidance for surface interval decompression sickness (DCS) risk after saturation dropout or aborted decompression, including, but not limited to; mitigation with various periods of oxygen pre-breathing and perfluorocarbon (PFC) administration; (7) evaluating the adequacy of hypothermia protection with present available clothing in combination with SEIS suits in SEIS rafts; (8) evaluating capability to escape from depths deeper than 600 feet by updating escape procedures and equipment; identifying necessary compression rates and further escape procedure and equipment changes that are needed; including new classes of operational submarines in the analysis; (9) improving senior survivor decision tools;(10) improving care of escape and rescue casualties within the U.S.
 Navy Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System, including, but not limited to critical care and casualty assessment.

The areas of primary interest in diving equipment, safety and effectiveness are organized along five Lines of Operation (LOO).  These LOO describe the primary areas of limitations for a diver and are:  Breathing Gas Supply, Human Performance, Environmental Protection, Decompression, and Tools, Transportation and Training.  Areas of interest in each LOO are:

(I)	Breathing Gas Supply: (1) Development of High pressure air flask, hose and regulators, high pressure defined for this purpose as greater than 5,000psi; (2) Improved CO2 scrubbing material for both free-swimming and fixed systems; (3) development of portable, minimal power input, O2 concentrators capable of working in conjunction with existing diving air compressors; (4) Developing a diver-worn system to extract breathing gas from surrounding seawater; (5) Developing a diver-worn system that could utilize seawater as CO2 scrubbing medium; (6) Improved helium reclaim system to support mixed gas and saturation dive systems; (7) Improved O2 sensor for use in closed-circuit UBAs; (8) Improved Portable Air Monitor that can test for all contaminants listed in table 4-2 of the U.S.
 Dive Manual in real time.

(II)	Human Performance: (1) Improving understanding of mechanism of oxygen toxicity and development of mitigations; (2) Developing and/or refining noise protection exposure limits; (3) Refine the understanding and mitigation of hypercapnia in divers; (4) Improve understanding of nitrogen narcosis to include mitigations and predictions of equivalent narcotic depths; (5) Improve understanding of effects on human body from immersion, exertion, breathing resistance, and temperature in relation to working underwater; (6) Improving understanding of and developing guidance for the prevention of immersion pulmonary edema
(III)	Environmental Protection: (1) Diver worn heater and/or chiller; (2) Temperature control for submerged divers in a wet submersible; (3) Physical protection for diver in grossly contaminated water as well as decontamination equipment and procedures; (4) Improved understanding of heat loss/retention in the submerged body, in effort to optimize heating/cooling of diver; (5) Improved passive thermal protection for divers to include improved durability to support field/combat conditions
(IV)	Decompression: (1)  Development of new decompression models valid across the full spectrum of diving;  (2) Improved procedures for shallow nitrogen-oxygen saturation diving including downward excursion dive capability on helium-nitrogen-oxygen mixtures; (3) Pharmacological or other novel mitigations for elimination of retained nitrogen in a diver; (4) Improving diagnosis of decompression illness through, but not limited to utilization of algorithms; (5) Improving understanding of the mechanisms of isobaric counter diffusion as it effects the skin, inner ear, and deep body tissues.
 (6) Improved decompression profiles based on the use of alternate gas mixtures, to include but not limited to Trimix. 
(V)	Tools, Transportation and Training: (1) Electronic recording and archiving of operational dive profiles to develop an operational dive data base; (2)  Develop a Transportable Recompression Chamber System (TRCS) replacement of similar or smaller dimensional size and functionality, using advance materials (i.e. carbon fiber, or other lightweight material) to reduce overall system weight for easier transport in military and commercial aircraft; (3) Improved diver communications, both wired and through-water; (4) Ability to track divers location underwater from surface support craft; (5) Through water data communication for divers (text, navigation, biometrics); (6) Improved diver propulsion devices to include diver worn and diver as passenger; (7) Decompression dive computer with flexibility to support multiple dives and varying breathing gas mixes; (8) Heads Up Display (HUD) for divers, both free-swimming and surface-supplied.
  HUD need not be limited to life support data (text, navigation, diagrams/schematics for projects, etc); (9) Low visibility vision enhancement for diver.

(2) Instructions for Preparation of Pre-proposal and Proposals

For FY14, the deadline for submission of pre-proposals is 3:00 PM CST, 30 March 2013 for the funding cycle that begins 1 October 2013, and the deadline for submission of full technical proposals is 3:00 PM CST, 4 June 2013.  Proposals received after the due date will be considered only if funds remain available.
The format for pre-proposals and proposals may be obtained from the Program Manager, at 202-781-4921 or E-mail: Kenneth.eisenberg@navy.mil.  The pre-proposal should be three to five pages of text and should include an estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for each year of the proposed effort.
  A curriculum vitae of the principal investigator(s) should be appended together with any supporting information, such as reprints or preprints, which will assist in the evaluation of the pre-proposal. 

Offerors submitting the most promising pre-proposals will be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their pre-proposal submission.  However, any such invitation does not obligate the Government to make an award.  Offerors are also advised all awards are subject to the DCAA contract audit process.  Any offeror may submit a full technical proposal even if its pre-proposal was not identified as promising or if no pre-proposal is submitted; however any full proposal submission would be made without the benefit of feedback prior to full proposal submission.
  A completed animal use protocol with supporting documentation is required before award when animals are employed. (Ref. SECNAVINST 3900.38C)  Any proposal that involves the experimental use of human subjects must include a separate evaluation of proposed technical approaches and associated risks by the contractor's committee for protection of human subjects. Before award, required documentation includes DoD Assurance, IRB approved Consent or waiver of documentation of informed consent, IRB approved protocol, documentation that the submitter/PI completed Human Research Protections Training, and a policy statement indicating that the institution will comply with the 32 CFR 219, DoDINST 3216.02, the SECNAVINST 3900.39 series, and all applicable sections of the 21 CFR.
  Offerors must state in their pre-proposals and full proposals that it is submitted in response to this BAA.  This BAA provides no funding for pre-proposals or subsequent proposal development purposes.  All pre-proposals will be acknowledged. Proposals will not be returned after evaluation. 

(3) Criteria for Selecting Proposals, their Relative Importance, and the Method of Evaluation

Pre-proposal and full technical proposal submissions will be evaluated on (1) the overall basis of innovation and scientific merit; (2) the relevance to submarine escape, rescue, and diving; (3) the overall value and affordability of the proposal; and (4) the offeror's capabilities, strengths and weaknesses or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.
  The Government reserves the right to select for funding any, all, part or none of the responses received.  For efforts funded as contracts, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities.  This is to notify potential offerors that each contract that may be placed under this announcement, or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause: "As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) an entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students.
 If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative payments unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award.  "If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any contract, including any existing contract, (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a contract or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation."  See instructions above for pre-proposals and proposals.
  The Government's preference is to award definitive contracts under this BAA.  However, an award can be made via grant at the sole discretion of the Government. 
All responsive sources may submit proposals that will be considered by NEDU.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals or join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete and severable areas of submarine escape, rescue, and diving for exclusive competition among these entities.  This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d) (2) (i).
  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Questions regarding this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist identified herein.  Technical content questions should be addressed to CAPT Ken Eisenberg, Deep Submergence Biomedical Development Program Manager, (202) 781-4921.  Interested parties are invited to respond to this synopsis.  All responsible parties will be considered. The following additional information is provided: (1) proposals may be submitted by any commercial firm, or institution of higher education, (2) notwithstanding the dates specified in this BAA, proposals may be submitted any time prior to expiration of the BAA, (3) the following e-mail point of contact is provided for information regarding technical programs/technologies of interest within the two areas identified: CAPT Ken Eisenberg (Kenneth.eisenberg@navy.mil) for diving safety and effectiveness and submarine escape and rescue and Mr.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to L-3 Communications, 7640 Omnitech Place Victor, NY 14564-9782 for the purchase the following: 

Part Number: GCS-1512eK-01T/ 1.2M Hawkeye III Lite Ku-Band (Total Quantity Needed: 65)

Part Number: GCS-1512eKX-01T/1.2M Hawkeye III Lite Ku, & X Band (Total Quantity Needed: 16)

Part Number: 0179-2103-02/Diplexer Kits (Total Quantity Needed: 17)

The purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The original VSAT terminal was the AN/USC-68A (produced by Rockwell Collins Satellite Communications Systems Inc).  However, this system reached end-of-life and a study was completed in FY 11.
  The Hawkeye Lite III was selected after extensive evaluation of various systems. 
 
The Hawkeye III Lite is part of the entire Rapid Response Kit (RRK) and is integral to its operation.  The RRK system has received an Approval to Operate (ATO) from Naval Network Warfare Command and has been certified through interoperability certification.  Substituting other network components will invalidate the ATO and will invalidate any interoperability certification.  To have equipment that is not accredited and to go through another accreditation process is six months for the accreditation package to be granted an Authority to Operate. This would lead to considerable delays and additional costs in the fielding the Rapid Response capability that is not expected to be recovered through competition.
  Further, this hardware is only available from the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and there are no known resellers or distributors.  

The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Only these items, provided by L-3 have been approved for the Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) use. Offerors wishing to provide responses/comments to this synopsis shall do so via email to Courtney.henslee@navy.mil no later than the closing date of this synopsis.
  The closing date of this synopsis is 18 April 2013.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination required 14 weeks after contract award. The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price commercial contract.

The Department of Defense will no longer award contracts to contractors not registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database.  Registration may be accomplished by accessing the SAM website at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.

<CONTACT>Kimberley Johnson, Phone 202-776-0200, Fax 202-776-0080, Email kjohnson@usac.org
<DESC><p align="left">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p align="left">The Universal Service Administrative Company ("USAC") is requesting information from software publishers, NAICS code 511210, capable of providing the services set forth herein inclusive of small businesses, including disadvantaged, woman-owned, HUB-zone, veteran-owned, and service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, (collectively, "small businesses").</p>
<p align="left">The Federal Communications Commission ("Commission" or "FCC") appointed USAC the administrator of the Universal Service Fund ("USF") and the universal service support mechanisms- High Cost ("HC" Program"); Low Income ("LI Program"); Rural Health Care ("RHC Program"), including its pilot program; and Schools and Libraries ("SL Program"), also referred to as E-rate, as set forth in Title 47, Part 54, Section 701 of the Code of Federal Regulations. USAC administers, subject to FCC regulations, directives and oversight, the USF and the Programs.<br /><br />This request for information (RFI) pertains to a future requirement for a board portal that will allow board of directors to securely access board documents and collaborate with other board members electronically.</p>
<p align="left">USAC will be conducting a competitive procurement to contract with a vendor that can provide board portal application systems that ensure business continuity. Vendors may offer 24/7 support, along with a high level of expertise on specific board portal functions. USAC desires a mainly commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)-based solution with portal administrators who can broadcast materials to all board members, or to a specific committee or selected individuals. USAC contemplates awarding a single firm-fixedprice contract for one year with four option years. USAC will use also the information received in response to this RFI to determine the potential for small business participation in the competition for this contract.</p>
<p align="left">USAC is not a federal agency, a government corporation, a government&nbsp; controlled corporation or other establishment in the Executive Branch of the United States Government. USAC is not a contractor to the Federal Government. The contract awarded as a result of the RFP will not be a subcontract under a Federal prime contract. However, USAC conducts its procurements in accordance with the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding with the FCC, which requires USAC, as a general matter, to apply designated provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulations ("FAR"), including requirements for full and open competition.</p>
<p align="left">SCOPE OF SERVICES</p>

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) in support of the Program Management Warfare (PMW) 750/760 is seeking comments from industry on the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) in preparation for the Performance Integration Contract follow-on.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes  it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Navy is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with comments on the attached PWS.  An Excel spreadsheet comment form is also provided (below) for the purposes of collecting comments and suggestions on the PWS document.  In additional to completing the comment form on the PWS, the Government is requesting a white paper addressing the following:  1. Describe your company size, history, primary customer base, and how your area of specialty relates to the scope described for this RFI.  2. What type of management structure does your company utilize? What is your company's vision of a staffing plan, including teaming arrangements and subcontractors, for the effort described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS)?  3. Many places of performance are specified in paragraph 1.2.1 of the PWS. The current budgetary climate has drastically reduced availability of travel funding. If your company does not have a presence in all of those locations, how would you ensure that the required efforts can be performed in those places while controlling costs? How extensive is your company's access to a mix of local labor/skills in locations where you do not actually have offices?  4. This procurement will not require a certified EVMS reporting system. Please provide examples of reports your company can deliver that would yield regular, reliable cost and schedule status to the third and fourth WBS level during each Task Order.  5. Much of the work described in this PWS will be performed at a Government facility and onboard ship, where material procured and/or integrated by the Contractor will be delivered. Provide information describing how you would support material management as described in section 4.4 of the PWS.  6. PWS paragraph 2.0 lists MIL STDs, processes, and specs we believe are applicable to this work. Please indicate any commercial standards your company currently utilizes that could result in equal or better quality and/or cost savings to the Government.  7. Upon reviewing the PWS, please provide questions or comments on the attached comment spreadsheet where the intent is unclear or in need of clarification.  Comments in the Microsoft Excel 2003 compatible spreadsheet and white papers are due no later than 3 May 2013, 14:00 PST.  Responses shall be submitted e-commerce.  Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to the Contract Specialist, at lynette.brewer@navy.mil.  Verbal questions will NOT be accepted.  Questions will be answered by posting answers to the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website; accordingly, questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information.  The Government does not guarantee that questions will be answered.  To access the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website, go to https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  Interested parties are invited to subscribe to the SPAWAR website to ensure they receive any important information updates connected with this RFI.

<p>AFRL has a requirement focusing on enabling the Air Force mission to perform Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) and Research and Development (R&amp;D) under an AFRL, Rome Research Site, RIE Division, Rome, NY contract.</p>
<p>Capable sources are sought to build on and extend the Automated Virtual Information Production Support System (AVIPSS) automated threat information production system of the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.</p>
<p>This effort:</p>
<p>1) Performs operations and maintenance (O&amp;M), research and development (R&amp;D), and intelligence production support to enhance, maintain, modernize, extend the capabilities of, operate and utilize, the NASIC AVIPSS. AVIPSS is designed to meet NASIC mission requirements. The effort is a part of an AFRL/RI enhancement, sustainment, and research and development program to deliver services and capabilities required to satisfy the demands of a continually changing production mission at NASIC in response to ever-evolving threats in an equally dynamic technological environment.</p>
<p>2) Provides the information technology solution to achieve NASIC corporate objectives for pre-positioning its analytical knowledge and enabling customers and intelligence analysts to build current, accurate and robust intelligence products. The effort will include the: research and development of parametric information models; design of physical and logical database structures; development of capabilities to interactively maintain data within the databases; implementation of the capabilities necessary to derive tailored specialized products from the textual and parametric databases and multimedia object repositories; design of high level constructs that dynamically incorporate database information into knowledge-oriented objects; and the development, implementation and maintenance of customer friendly software applications/tools and interfaces; as specified in a Performance Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p>The AVIPSS consists of the Systematic Architecture for Virtual Analytic Net-Centric Threat Intelligence (SAVANT<sup>TM</sup>) system, the Next Generation Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming (EWIR) System (NGES), the Foreign Media Collaboration Framework (FMCF) and its extensions and additional architecture and legacy infrastructure, analysis and information systems. Major components of the SAVANT<sup>TM</sup> are the: Knowledge Management Map and related applications and tools; the Knowledge Pre-positioning System (KPS); Virtual Production System (VPS); Virtual Intelligence Product Retrieval Environment (VIPRE); the SAVANT<sup>TM</sup> Metadata Repository (SMR); and the Joint Analytic Data Editor (JADE). Support shall be provided for the systems including (but not limited to): Analyst Support Architecture (ASA); Ballistic Missile Information System (BMIS); Digital Library Input Processing System (DLIPS); Foreign Military Laser Database (FMLD); Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) Portal; Tactics and Training, Track Military Entities (TrackME); Data Tracker; Production Operations Management Information Systems (PROMIS); GlobalEdge; Military Equipment Parametric Engineering Database (MEPED); Dynamic Information Operations Decision Environment (DIODE); Arc Geographic Information System (ArcGIS); Requirements Authoring and Validation Environment (RAVEN); Malware; Directed Energy Weapons/Global Laser Incident Database and Event Reporting (DEW/GLIDER); space mission area products; Acquisition Log Database (ALDB); Information Technology Requirements Database (ITRD); Links and Nodes (L&amp;N); TEL-SCOPE telecommunications network tool; SAVANT<sup>TM</sup> Cross Domain Data Migration system; space related databases; and SharePoint Open Source Portal.</p>
<p>3) The design and implementation of software enhancements and maintenance of databases and applications that are used in the management of NASIC intelligence production, computer, personnel, physical and operations security, civilian and military personnel, training, all-source collections requirements and other technical tasks that keep NASIC systems functioning will also be supported as specified in a PWS. Further, this effort will support the research and development, enhancement, implementation and maintenance of national level systems for the input, translation, and retrieval of all-source information and for the continued design, development, implementation, and deployment of a DODIIS-wide information notification system as specified in a PWS.</p>
<p>Anticipated deliverables include: operations, maintenance and system administration services; computer software; software documentation; software and technical engineering analyses; technical reports; installations at other Intelligence Community locations; security documentation; financial and progress reports; work plans and presentations. This procurement is a Performance-Based Services Acquisition (PBSA). The contract type is to be determined. A period of performance of forty (48) months is anticipated. Future mission requirements changes are also expected during the contract period of performance, including deployments to new locations and NASIC customers, which historically require additional enhancements other than those which will be identified in the solicitation. Potential research and development transition opportunities are also anticipated, but not yet identified.<br />Foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level. The successful contractor may receive and/or generate technical data subject to export control in the performance of the contract. Therefore, prospective offerors must provide a completed and approved DD Form 2345 which certifies the offeror is on the Certified Contractors Access List (CCAL) or the offeror is seeking application to CCAL. The successful offeror must have a completed and approved DD Form 2345 prior to award. For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistic Information Service at 1-877-352-2255 or on the web at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/. It is the sole responsibility of the contractor to obtain an export license from the U.S. Department of State and to comply with the federal laws and regulations. Questions concerning the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and export licensing must be directed to the U.S. Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and not the Air Force Program Manager, Contracting Office, or Air Force Foreign Disclosure Office.</p>
<p>The work requires a TOP SECRET facility clearance, a SECRET level safeguarding capability and approximately forty (40) personnel with Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) security clearances for performance at time of award. An additional estimated minimal thirty (30) cleared personnel are required within the first ninety (90) days of award, with a total of ninety (90) (number dependent upon contractor organization and assignment of work), cleared personnel required within 120 days of award.</p>

<p>In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting with an Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer, Scott Podkowka, (315) 330-4716, Scott.Podkowka@rl.af.mil, for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (NOV 2012) will be incorporated into the resultant contract. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the Ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The Ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Consulting an Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, concerned parties may contact the following AFRL Ombudsman: Barbara Gehrs, Building 15, RM 225, 1864 4th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130 facsimile: 937-656-7321 COM: 937-904-4407.

The Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the Ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contract Specialist.</p>
<p>A Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) is expected to be posted for review and comment at a later date. The entire solicitation will be issued on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fbo.gov. All prospective offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of all other information pertaining to this solicitation.</p>
<p>While the Small Business Specialist, Janis Norelli, is the focal point for receipt of the statements of capabilities, technical questions should be directed to the Laboratory Program Manager, James Sieffert, 315-330-2344 or email James.Sieffert@rl.af.mil. Contractual questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Jacquelyn Benedict, 315-330-3270, or e-mail Jacquelyn.Benedict@rl.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for CubeSat-Class Payload launch services.  A CubeSat is a type of miniaturized space research satellite that typically uses commercial, off-the-shelf electronic components. The CubeSats flown by NASA are primarily developed by a variety of educational and Governmental organizations.  NASA/KSC is seeking capability statements from all interested small businesses, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition for CubeSat-Class Payload launch services.	The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 336414 with a size standard of 1000 employees. It is anticipated that this procurement will consider domestic sources only as Public Law 105-303, 51 U.S.C 50131, et. seq., states that the Federal Government shall acquire space transportation services from United States commercial providers whenever such services are required in the course of its activities.	 The launch service shall be capable of delivering a total mass of between 15kg-150kg to a minimum orbital altitude of 425km with a launch inclination from 0 to 98 degrees.  The contractor will be responsible for performance of launch vehicle advance planning and analysis; as well as design, development, production, integration, and testing required to provide the launch services appropriate to transport these payloads to a desired orbit.	There are multiple CubeSat configurations based on the 1U form factor such as a 2U (22cm x 10cm x 10cm), 3U (34cm x 10cm x 10cm), 6U (34cm x 20cm x 10cm) etc.	The minimum launch service shall have the capability to launch three Government provided (3 3U) Cubesat-Class payloads, with the offeror determining the total number or mass that the launch vehicle will be able to accommodate.  Launch is anticipated in the 2016 timeframe, however it could be earlier if the provider is ready.  The launch service provider will be responsible for obtaining a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) license and securing any necessary Range assets for the launch. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<DESC>Thermoluminescent (TLD) cards for the Navys Radiation dosimeter badge DT-702

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) in support of the Naval Systems CommandsRADIAC Program Office SEA 04RN is seeking information from vendors who may be interested in fabricating TLD cards for the Navys Personnel Radiation Dosimeter badge DT-702. Currently, the dosimeter badge and the reader are fabricated and provided by Thermo Fisher. The intent is to seek alternate vendors for the TLD card only. 

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes  it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.
  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Navy is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partys expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.

Description

The Navy is researching vendors who can produce thermo-luminescent (TL) cards currently in use in the Navy's personnel radiation dosimetry badge DT-702.
  This badge is used to monitor deep and shallow dose from high and low energy photons, beta rays and neutrons. The Navy currently uses a four-element TLD badge consisting of high sensitivity lithium fluoride (LiF: Mg, Cu, P) chips. The chips are encapsulated in clear thin Teflon sheets, mounted on an aluminum card, and placed in a plastic holder which holds appropriate filters for each of the four elements.  Two chips of same thickness are made of TLD-700H (containing natural lithium) material, with one positioned behind a copper filter and another positioned behind a Teflon filter in the holder.  A third, thinner TLD-700H chip is positioned behind a mylar window in the holder. The fourth chip, made of TLD-600H (containing enriched 6Li to detect thermal neutrons) is positioned behind a tin filter in the holder.
  An appropriate algorithm based on the response of these chips determines shallow and deep dose and neutron exposure to meet the requirements of all the categories defined in ANSI/HPS N13.11-2009. The current research is confined to identify the vendors which have the capability to manufacture the TLD cards which can exactly replace the current cards in form, fit and function in the current plastic holders.

Responses

Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.  White papers in Microsoft Word for Office 2010 compatible format are due no later than 02 MAY 2013, 17:00 EDT.  Responses shall be limited to 10 pages and submitted via e-mail only to stanley.mavrogianis@navy.mil.

The period of performance for the extension will be a three-month period of 1 July 2013 through 30 September 2013. The National Target Base (NTB)/National Desired Ground Zero (DGZ) List (NDL) Integrated Development System (NIDS II) is a subsystem of the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) supporting assigned Operational Plans (OPLANS), to include OPLAN 8044, Theater Planning, and Global Strike Support Documents, and new UCP tasking and related products through target selection and DGZ Construction capabilities.

Additionally, the contractor will provide systems engineering services for future software development tasks, as they become relevant to the USSTRATCOM strategic mission.<br />The follow-on effort source selection will not be completed by the end of the current contract extension on 30 June 2013. Therefore, the Government intends a three month extension of the current contract (1 July 2013 through 30 September 2013) to allow time for completion of the follow-on source selection.<br />This notice is neither a request for a competitive proposal or a solicitation for offerors.

This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.<br />

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Sole Source 
<SOLNBR>N6264513ADV14
<ARCHDATE>04182013
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 6.302-1 to Magnum Medical Overseas JV LLC, 929 County Road 687, Angleton, TX 77515, for the continuation of Educational and Developmental Intervention Services (EDIS) in support of the Special Programs Division at the Department of the Navy, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED). 

The purpose of this contract is to provide early intervention services to infants and toddlers with disabilities (birth through 2 years, inclusive) and their families, and special education and related services to children with disabilities (ages 3 through 21 years, inclusive) entitled to receive special services from the Department of Defense; provision of a Free, Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) including special education and related services for children with disabilities enrolled in the Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DoDDS), as specified in their Individualized Educational Programs (IEP); and monitoring of DoD programs providing EIS, special education, and related services for compliance with DoD Instruction 1342.12.									

The period of performance for the proposed contract is anticipated to be a 9-month period of performance, 04/01/2013 to 12/31/2013.
  The total estimated value of the proposed contract is $4.445 million.    

These services will expire under the current contract arrangement with the Department of the Army on 31 March 2013.  NMLC plans to issue a longer-term competitive procurement for EDIS services.  NMLC cannot complete a new competitive award by the 31 March 2013 expiration of the current contract.  The only way to provide uninterrupted services is through the use of a bridge contract.  The bridge contract will provide continuity of EDIS support services necessary to ensure the new competitive procurement has an appropriate timetable to evaluate, award, and implement a new contract.  

Services for this requirement are required OCONUS in Okinawa and Yokosuka Japan, Guam, Naples and Sicily Italy, as well as Rota, Spain.
   The Government recognizes that historically it takes new contractors considerable time (up to 60-90 days) to credential and place employees performing OCONUS due to host country requirements.   Magnum Medical Overseas JV LLC, as the incumbent Contractor already has personnel in place with the unique training and orientation to meet the period of performance start date of 1 April 2013.  No other contractor would be able to recruit, place, and provide specialized training to employees in order to avoid a lapse in service.  Therefore, Magnum Medical Overseas JV LLC is the only source capable of providing these services to ensure uninterrupted EDIS support.

All capability statements received by 10:00AM local Time on March 13, 2013, will be considered by the Government.
  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capability statements shall be submitted by email ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to wayne.medina@med.navy.mil.

<DESC>DETERMINATION TO SOLICIT FROM A SINGLE SOURCE 	 Solicitation No.: R13PS30092 Project Name: Specialty Carbon Exciter Brushes for Hoover Dam 
1.	Agency and Contracting Activity. Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Regional Office, Hoover Dam. 2.	 Name and Address of Single Source.  Mersen USA Bn. Corp. 400 Myrtle Ave. Boonton, New Jersey, 07005 USA 3.	Description of Supplies/Services and Estimated Cost. The proposed requirement is for the supply of various types of Specialty Exciter Brushes on an as needed basis with the following performance requirements: Current density of 12 to 20 A/cm2 with a low friction, high electrical conductivity, good mechanical stability, low friction coefficient, low resistivity material, high quality tamping, optimized cable dimensions, has a brush wear warning systems, brush-holders with dust exhaust system and wide speed range. 
4.	Description of Circumstances, including why only one source is reasonably available.
Mersen is the only vendor that designs, manufactures, and distributes the exciter carbon brushes and exciter brush holders that are customized to meet Hoover Dam's specific requirement. Mersen designed these brushes to meet Hoover Dam's performance requirements. The following performance requirements are: Current density of 12 to 20 A/cm2 with a low friction, high electrical conductivity, good mechanical stability, low friction coefficient, low resistivity material, high quality tamping, optimized cable dimensions, has a brush wear warning systems, brush-holders with dust exhaust system and wide speed range. Due to these factors, these brushes are the only brushes available in the market place that is specially designed for cleaning Hoover Dam's Exciter Rotors. Mersen is the only vendor that manufactures and distributes specialty brushes designed for Hoover Dam's exciter Rotors. Orders for these brushes can only be placed through Mersen because they do not have authorized distributors. Changing the brush type at this time would require and other Vendor to reverse engineer and design and custom fabricate all brushes to be compatible to the existing Mersen brush holders, etc.
5.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost. Comparison with similar items in the related industry show that Mersen's prices reflect the prices being charged on GSA and their prices are within the GSA price ranges. Furthermore, FAR 8.404 (d) states that GSA has already determined the prices of supplies to be fair and reasonable Therefore, Mersen's price is determined to be fair and reasonable to the Government. 
Additionally, changing products would incur additional and unnecessary costs to the Government because if an equal product was purchased, the Government would have to incur additional costs associated with replacing all the existing Mersen brushes, holders, and hardware in Hoover's inventory. Purchasing an equal product would also create substantial engineering costs associated with attempting to customize the equal products in order to be compatible with Hoover Dam's Exciter Rotors. 

6.	Description of Market Research. 
A sources sought notice was posted on 01/30/2013 and no capability statements were received. Therefore, based on factors outlined in section 4, Mersen is the only vendor that designs, manufactures, and distributes the exciter carbon brushes and exciter brush holders that are customized to meet Hoover Dam's specific requirement and there are no other vendors that can manufacture Specialty Exciter Brushes in accordance to Hoover Dam's performance requirements.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source Firm Fixed-Price Contract (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).
<p>The Food and Drug Administration's Office of Acquisition and Grant Services intends to issue a sole source award to Jackson Laboratories for multiple strains of severely immuno-compromised mice. Strains include:</p>
<p>Stock #005557 (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ)<br />Stock #007799 (NOD.Cg-Rag1tm1Mom Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ<br />Stock #000651 (BALB/cJ)</p>
<p>Scientists within FDA performing humanized mouse research have utilized these specific proprietary strains of severely immune compromised mice that are only available from The Jackson Laboratory. Other vendors sell immune compromised mice; however, they are not the same genetic strain and have inherent risk associated with their use. This risk includes the need to repeat all preliminary studies with a new strain of mice, since they are not the biologically the same and would yield different results. <br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1. The estimated dollar value for this action is not to exceed $150,000. This will result in a contract for a base year with two option years. The projected award date is April 30, 2013.</p>
<p>Interested parties may submit a capability statement by April 16, 2013 for considerations by the agency. Responses must be sent to Juana Quinteros via email at juana.quinteros@fda.hhs.gov. All correspondence must reference FDA-RFP-1113768.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.305(a), the justification is being made publicly available within 14 days after contract award:<br /><br />Justification for Other Than <br />Full and Open Competition<br />January, 2013<br />Contracting Activity<br />Contract: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (Bridge Effort)<br />Contractor: New World Apps (NWA)<br />Required Activity: Bridge Contract <br />Acquisition Office:Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL)<br />Contracting Office Location:<br />US Small Business Administration<br />Denver Acquisition Office<br />721 19th Street, Room 355<br />Denver, CO 80202<br />Contracting Officer: Kent Morgan <br />Contract Specialist, Contractor, EGS, Inc.<br />US Small Business Administration<br />Denver Acquisition Office<br />721 19th Street, Room 355<br />Denver, CO 80202<br />(303) 844-2027 (Tel)<br />(303) 844-2119 (Fax)<br />1.Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed<br />Approval of this Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) provides the authority to award a sole-source hosting contract to New World Apps Corporation (NWA) - Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies of Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The resulting action is award of a sole source bridge contract (up to but not exceeding 12 months) to meet mission critical requirements while an on-going assessment and competition for the follow-on acquisition is being completed. Based on the projected mission and workload requirements, the program office projects an estimated contract value of up to $XXXXXX for this bridge effort.
<p>This sole-source effort provides continued hosting support to the Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) to support the agency's online efforts.</p>
<p>2.Description of the Supplies/Services Required to Meet Agency's Needs</p>
<p>The SBA.gov web site serves as a portal for small businesses and their owners to access the Agency's diverse and comprehensive resources. The site is intended as a resource for managing a small business, expanding a business, increasing knowledge, productivity and expertise, aiding and informing small business regarding obtaining business licenses and permits, obtaining business loans and grants, accessing external links to related resources, providing social media, providing Section 508 compliance information and other forms of searching for needed assistance.</p>
<p>The Agency is iteratively enhancing and expanding the functionality of the SBA.gov digital universe, in an ongoing initiative aimed at providing a consolidated resource addressing the unique needs of the small business, one which brings together, and fosters communication between, the small business community and the Agency's public- and private-sector partners.</p>
<p>The SBA requires managed web hosting services and software procurement and installation services to support this effort. This proposed sole-source effort will provide continued hosting service required for SBA.gov, SBIR and NWBC.gov for up to 12 months in the interim.</p>
<p>3.Statutory Authority Permitting other than Full and Open Competition<br />This request is made pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. &sect; 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii)(A and B):</p>
<p>(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or</p>
<p>(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)</p>
<p>Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.302-l(a)(2)(ii)(B), full and open competition is not required when it is likely that an award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirements. Awarding to a new contractor during this short period of performance will seriously harm SBA's ability to sustain its Web site and jeopardize online operational capabilities to support small businesses, should this sole source contract effort not be authorized. Failure to retain the current contractor throughout the on-going source selection will result in significant delays to government operations. <br />In accordance with FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii)(A)] - Substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>The agency has to date invested well over $3 million into the Business Gateway Project's Web hosting and software services, in support of the SBA.gov redesign effort. The incumbent service provider, New World Apps, has over the lifetime of their current and past contracts provided a broad range of products and services to the agency, including:</p>
<p>&bull; Physical infrastructure (hardware) - servers, firewall appliances, databases, etc.<br />&bull; Operating system and software servers - Microsoft Windows Server, Web, database, content management, disaster recovery<br />&bull; Professional services - hardware administration, network administration, system administration, database administration, facilities management, disaster recovery, intrusion detection, vulnerability scanning, system audits</p>
<p>The agency's to date investment represents a sunk cost which cannot be recovered within a short- to mid-range timeframe; rather, the recovery horizon is greater than five years out, should the agency not incur additional sunk costs. Additionally, no less than $1.5 million in initial startup costs would be required to establish a new hosting environment. The incurring of such additional costs would be the case should the project be required to change its Web hosting and software services provider. Such a change would necessitate the negotiation of new hardware and software services and support contracts, the securing and provisioning of new hardware with the new provider, and the transition of content from the incumbent to the incoming provider.</p>
<p>Also, as a result of their engagement to date, the incumbent possesses detailed knowledge of the agency, the project, and the project's information architecture. This deep functional knowledge cannot be replicated without a substantial duplication of cost and effort, one which will result in delays and potential service interruptions, and which will adversely impact the delivery of both products and services to the agency and its customers.</p>
<p>Additional and duplicative costs would be incurred, rather than recovered, as a result of full and open competition.</p>
<p>4.Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable</p>
<p>The work to be performed under the new contract will fall within the current contract scope and pricing structure. The Contracting Officer will utilize the current contract rates and any other necessary cost and pricing data to ensure the cost to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>5.Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research was not Conducted<br />NA<br />6.Any Other Facts Supporting the use of the Other than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>This requirement is in the process of being re-competed. The new procurement will be a competitive award. This bridge continuation of services is to sustain hosting services until analysis of the cloud computing option is completed and a new contract is competitively awarded. Given the compressed acquisition timeline and period of performance, the government expects that either a break in service or a short notice change in contractors with no transition period will seriously disrupt mission-critical operations affecting online access to SBA information. Therefore, the risk is deemed unacceptable and must be mitigated with this sole source bridge contract.</p>
<p>7.List of Sources, if any, that Expressed Interest in the Acquisition<br />NA</p>
<p>8.A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency may take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before making Subsequent Acquisitions for the supplies or Services Required<br />The follow-on hosting contract will be a competitive award.</p>
<p>9.Contracting Officer's Certification<br />TBD</p>
<p>10.Technical/Requirement Personnel's Certification<br />The Program Manager for this effort is responsible for verifying the technical requirement for this effort. (FAR 6.303-2(b))</p>

<a href="mailto:melissa.a.svetich2@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Baltimore</a>
<DESC>The United States Corps of Engineers (USACE), Baltimore District, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction projects (greater than $25M) within the Western States (primarily Utah, Nevada and Colorado).  Projects may consist of a broad variety of major and minor repair, modification, rehabilitation, alterations and new construction projects in a Secure Environment. <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).   <br>  <br> Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy states: Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.  Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) be consistent with law.  Reference: Provision: FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement, Clause: FAR 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs.  Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br>  <br> (1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts awarded by the Baltimore District Corps of Engineers in the Western States?   <br>  <br> (2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? <br>  <br> (3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br>  <br> (4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses? <br>  <br> (5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA? <br>  <br> (6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA? <br>  <br> (7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Baltimore District solicitation and any resultant contract? <br>  <br> Responses shall be submitted via email to Melissa Svetich at Melissa.A.Svetich2@usace.army.mil no later than 3 p.m. (EST) on 12 April 2013.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government.  Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this survey. <br>  <br>

<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br /><br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br /><br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />Subfactor 2 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br /><br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br /><br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br /><br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br /><br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br /><br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Redstone intends to issue a sole source requirement for a 5-year follow-on Firm- Fixed Priced and Cost type contract for Aerial Weapons Scoring Systems (AWSS) Engineering Services and Hardware.  It is anticipated that this action will result in a new contract to Meggitt Defense Systems, Inc.  (MDSI), Irvine, CA 92618-2521.  The hardware portion of the contract will be firm-fixed price, and the engineering services portion of the contract will be cost-plus-fixed-fee.  The proposed cost type of contract for the engineering services portion is appropriate, since performance uncertainties are of such magnitude that costs cannot be estimated with sufficient reasonableness to permit the use of any type of fixed price contract.   <br>  <br> This requirement is for AWSS scoring hardware and engineering services required in support of aviation gunnery exercises at selected CONUS and OCONUS Ranges, Posts, Camps, and Stations.  The engineering services support is to be used for the following type of efforts:  (1) resolve problems encountered during field services for existing AWSS; (2) provide technical engineering support and field support of AWSS (3) evaluate modifications and improvements to AWSS hardware to accommodate unique and long-term requirements; (4) design, develop, and fabricate new scoring prototype hardware that will interface with existing equipment; (5) support AWSS integration into the Digital Range Training System (DRTS); (6) support upgrades to the Unity Gunnery Commanders Report based upon updated training manual; (7) maintain information assurance (IA) compliance; and (8) support foreign military sales.  See numbered note 22. <br>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. (ii) Solicitation R13PS80259 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). (iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-66. (iv) This is a 100% small business set aside. The applicable NAICS is 541711 and the associated size standard is 500 employees. (v) Contract line item number(s) and items, quantities and units of measure, (including option(s), if applicable). CLIN 0001 - Monoclonal Antibody Production Services QTY 1 Lump Sum. Firm Fixed Price (vi) Description of requirements for the items to be acquired. Monoclonal Antibody Production Statement of Objectives: 1.0 Background. Zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and Quagga (Dreissena bugensis) mussels are invasive species introduced to North America during the 1980's.  Among freshwater mussel species, they have the unique ability to attach to a variety of surfaces and impede the flow of water.  Therefore, Reclamation has a need for a monitoring program that will allow managers to implement in a timely manner accommodating and/or preventative measures at Reclamation water delivery facilities.  The larval veliger is the primary means of colonization in new freshwater environments and offers the best avenue for early detection due to its much greater abundance and spatial distribution, relative to attached adults, in the early stages of infestation.  The ultimate goal of this project is to mass produce monoclonal antibodies that can be tagged for use in laboratory immunocapture and immunofluorescence methods that target zebra and quagga mussel larvae (veligers). 2.0 Overall Objective. The overall objective of the Monoclonal Antibody Production services is to produce a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to quagga mussel larvae.  Since the target for this project is not a typical immunogen, it is expected that the contractor will have experience generating antibodies against Dreissena spp. (e.g., quagga and zebra mussels) and generating monoclonal antibodies to a wide diversity of intact organisms, agents, and proteins. All hybridoma cell lines, monoclonal antibodies, ascites fluid, culture supernatants, and other products directly funded by Reclamation remain the sole and exclusive property of Reclamation and will be shipped to Reclamation or its named collaborator upon request. 3.0 Contract Objectives. The following is a listing of specific objectives required under this contract:  a.	Use the provided protein as an immunogen, using a protocol that favors a high affinity IgG response. b.	Monitor serum antibody titers throughout the immunization period and provide serum samples to Reclamation or its collaborator for testing and evaluation. c.	Create hybridomas through fusion of antibody-producing cells (from highest titer immunization) and at least two myeloma cell lines. d.	Test at least 525 fusion cultures for antibody specific to the immunogen and expand all antibody-positive cultures. The contractor is expected to maintain both master and working cell banks. e.	Subclone at least 10 antibody-positive cultures. If both fusion partner cell lines produce equal amounts of antibody, cultures from both cell lines will be expanded. If hybridomas from the two cell lines do not produce equal amounts of antibody, all cultures will be derived from the cell line producing the highest antibody concentration.   f.	Provide all antibody-positive subclones to Reclamation or its collaborator. g.	Determine antibody isotypes for each positive clone. h.	Perform cross-reactivity ELISA testing of selected clones using proteins provided by Reclamation or its collaborator. i.	Provide frozen storage for the products from each stage of the process for at least six months following completion of the project. Stored products will include original fusion cocktails from both cell lines, all developed cell lines, all antibody-positive cell cultures, and back-ups of cell cultures. j.	Mass produce antibody for five clones using in-vitro procedures and culture volumes of at least 150 mL. k.	Provide Reclamation or its collaborator with cell culture supernatant.  l.     Purify the final antibody using Protein-A or Protein-G based procedures. 4.0 Constraints: a. Initial target for deliverables is to provide final antibody within three months of receiving the protein antigen, contingent upon protocols proposed by contractor. b. Contractor must provide proof of licensing for producing antibodies from host animals. c. Contractor shall maintain accurate and thorough records of cell lines, clones, and antibody production, following Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines and standardized QA/QC requirements for cell culture-based processes. (vii) Date(s) and place(s) of delivery and acceptance and FOB point -N/A (viii) The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Offerors must submit a single volume proposal which includes a technical proposal, past performance information, and a firm fixed price offer. Technical proposals must demonstrate capability, therefore, do not merely reiterate the objectives or reformulate the requirements specified in the solicitation. The offeror should submit a specific, detailed, and complete detailed statement of work that demonstrates the offeror has a thorough understanding of the requirements and constraints for accomplishment of the effort. Due to the collaborative nature of this project, the contractor's statement of work shall also detail how the contractor proposes to maintain timely and effective communication with government representatives to assure successful and timely completion of this project.  Past performance information must include contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information, when applicable. Price information should include a firm fixed price lump sum amount. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions, technical approaches, or pricing structures for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. (ix) The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items Applies to this acquisition. The following factors, listed in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate offers: 1) Technical Experience and Approach - The Offeror's proposal will be evaluated to the extent the offeror's demonstrated experience and proposed technical approach addresses all contract objectives and constraints and represents a realistic and sound approach to meeting the requirement objectives. 2) Past Performance - Past performance evaluation will focus on the quality of recent and relevant previous work produced by the offeror.  3) Price - Price will be evaluated for price fair and reasonableness. Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important when compared to price. The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable price. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest-priced schedule contractor if the superior technical submission or the submission indicating a reduced performance risk, warrants paying a premium. (x) The provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, is applicable but see Para (xiii). (xi) The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. (xii) The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition, including the following; b(8), b(12), b(23), b(26), b(27), b(28), b(29), b(38), b(42), b(47).  (xiii) In order to be eligible for award, offerors must be registered, and have their Representations and Certifications uploaded, in the System for Award Management at www.sam.gov. (xiv) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) is not applicable. (xv) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to Thomas Elliott at telliott@usbr.gov and are due April 16, 2013 by 12:00 PM MDT. (xvi) Questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing to Thomas Elliott at telliott@usbr.gov.

Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>

<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>

<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>

<p>(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement; (<br />ii) price;<br />(iii) past performance (see FAR 15.304);</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are Approximately equal to cost or price</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p><br />WAWF<br />EXPEDITE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT<br /><br />(a) This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. For the Department of Defense, the MANDATORY method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.) This means that paper invoices are not permitted and will not be processed for payment. <br /><br />(b) Definitions Important to the WAWF Process<br /><br />Acceptor: The organization or person designated in block 15 of the SF 1449 (cover page of the purchase request) who accepts the products or services tendered. The acceptor has a unique DoDAAC (Department of Defense Activity Address Code) shown in the upper right had box of block 15 that must be used to notify the acceptor that an electronic invoice is pending.<br /><br />DoDAAC: As stated above, an acronym for Department of Defense Activity Address Code. This code unique to each organization in the Department of Defense. Knowledge of what DoDAAC codes must be input into WAWF electronic invoices is crucial to the payment process as it alerts the acceptor that an invoice is pending for acceptance and alerts the payment office that a completed action is ready to process for payment.<br /><br />Payment Office: The location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office shown in block 18a of the SF 1449 that will process your electronic invoices. The payment office also has a unique DoDAAC.<br /><br />(c) Options within WAWF include a "combo" for supply items, a 2-in-1 invoice for service contracts and a "stand-alone" invoice. It is recommended that the use of, stand-alone invoices be avoided. The matching of "stand-alone" invoices by DFAS offices requires invoices and receiving reports be separately or individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity and can routinely cause lengthy delays and possible rejection because they do not appear together and therefore must be individually matched and then verified. The use of the "combo" or "2-in-1" does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching. Detailed instructions on how to create an invoice, as well as other topical issues, can be found at the WAWF training website at http://www.wawftraining.com .<br /><br />(d) A key, important, and imperative step for vendors to take is to e-mail notification to the acceptor identified in the contract in block 15 by clicking on the "Send More E-Mail Notifications" link in WAWF upon submission of the electronic invoice instrument (combo or 2-in1). This step provides notice to the acceptor of your pending invoice<br /><br />Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html .

Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?

The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt.

When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

The Contractor shall furnish this notice within 60 days after the increase or decrease, or within any additional period that the Contracting Officer may approve in writing, but not later than the date of final payment under this contract. The notice shall include the Contractor?s proposal for an adjustment in the contract unit prices to be negotiated under paragraph (b) of this clause, and shall include, in the form required by the Contracting Officer, supporting data explaining the cause, effective date, and amount of the increase or decrease and the amount of the Contractor?s adjustment proposal. (b) Promptly after the Contracting Officer receives the notice and data under paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contracting Officer and the Contractor shall negotiate a price adjustment in the contract unit prices and its effective date. However, the Contracting Officer may postpone the negotiations until an accumulation of increases and decreases in the labor rates (including fringe benefits) and unit prices of material shown in the Schedule results in an adjustment allowable under paragraph (c)(3) of this clause. The Contracting Officer shall modify this contract (1) to include the price adjustment and its effective date and (2) to revise the labor rates (including fringe benefits) or unit prices of material as shown in the Schedule to reflect the increases or decreases resulting from the adjustment. The Contractor shall continue performance pending agreement on, or determination of, any adjustment and its effective date. . <BR> <BR>(c) Any price adjustment under this clause is subject to the following limitations: (1) Any adjustment shall be limited to the effect on unit prices of the increases or decreases in the rates of pay for labor (including fringe benefits) or unit prices for material shown in the Schedule.

(i) Supplies or services for which the production cost is not affected by such changes; (ii) Changes in rates or unit prices other than those shown in the Schedule; or (iii) Changes in the quantities of labor or material used from those shown in the Schedule for each item. (2) No upward adjustment shall apply to supplies or services that are required to be delivered or performed before the effective date of the adjustment, unless the Contractor?s failure to deliver or perform according to the delivery schedule results from causes beyond the Contractor?s control and without its fault or negligence, within the meaning of the Default clause. (3) There shall be no adjustment for any change in rates of pay for labor (including fringe benefits) or unit prices for material which would not result in a net change of at least 3 percent of the then-current total contract price. This limitation shall not apply, however, if, after final delivery of all contract line items, either party requests an adjustment under paragraph (b) of this clause. (4) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price made under this clause shall not exceed 10 percent of the original unit price. There is no percentage limitation on the amount of decreases that may be made under this clause. (d) The Contracting Officer may examine the Contractor?s books, records, and other supporting data relevant to the cost of labor (including fringe benefits) and material during all reasonable times until the end of 3 years after the date of final payment under this contract or the time periods specified in Subpart 4.7 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), whichever is earlier. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 17.208(f), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 17.208(g), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 Days; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days  before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 5 (years). <BR> <BR>DOI ELECTRONIC INVOICING Electronic Invoicing and Payment Requirements - Internet Payment Platform (IPP) APRIL 2011

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>

Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Material omissions may cause the technical proposal to be rejected as unacceptable. Submissions that tend to be vague, generic, or lacking detail may be considered unacceptable. The failure to include information requested in the individual factors may result in the offer being found deficient and therefore unacceptable. The Government cannot make award based on a deficient or unacceptable offer. Receipt of an "Unacceptable" determination of acceptability for any factor will make the offer ineligible for award, unless the Government elects to enter discussions and deficiencies are remedied in a revised proposal. <br><br>FACTOR 1:  BUSINESS TYPE/CLASSIFICATION & FIRM INFORMATION. <br><br>GENERAL: It is the objective of this solicitation/synopsis to give priority consideration to those firms who are classified as (1) Small Business per SBA identifications, (2) meet the qualifications as established by the Small Business Administration and (3) preference to firms located in the Ft Bragg area. All Offeror's shall provide a narrative detailing their small business status as well as the firm's information as requested in this solicitation/synopsis.  Firms shall detail their level of self performance for the required work and the level of all sub-contractors. Joint Venture partners should each demonstrate experience commensurate with their roles and explain in the subject narrative how their experience qualifies them for their role for these BPA's. The narrative shall also include the role and participation of each partner.<br><br> Included in this Factor is the requirement to submit price-lists and/or labor rates. <br><br>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's narrative on the requirements as described herein. <br><br>The Business Type/Classification & Firm information narrative shall describe the Offeror's status as a small business, large business, joint venture, etc. The narrative shall list the SAM registration status (with current date or expiration), DUNS number and Cage Code as well as the NAICS codes as applicable. (A copy of the SAM page can be included as an attachment to this Factor for expedient review but is not required and if included, will not count as to the total page count for this factor.) If the Offeror identifies themselves as a small business, the classification as defined by the SBA - that is, Women Owned, 8a, Service Disabled, etc. <br><br>The narrative shall include all information relevant to the firm as to address and primary office location, address of secondary or sub-contractor offices, telephone numbers, size, required certifications for applicable trades, and any other pertinent information directly related to the nature of the firm being submitted - that is, management-oversight, self-performing, etc.  More consideration will be given to those Offeror's who are self performing - that is, the primary business function of the firm is relevant to the PWS of this solicitation/synopsis. <br><br>Each firm submitting will be evaluated on a Go/No-Go basis for meeting SBA classification status. Priority consideration will be given to those firms who are classified as Small Business and meet the qualifications as established by the Small Business Administration. Any business not identified by classification in the submittal or identified as a Large Business will receive a No-Go determination. <br><br>The order of precedence for locality consideration is as follows: (1) those firms who are located within a 4-hour radius of Ft Bragg/Pope AFB regional school District will be given the highest consideration; rated as highly acceptable; (2) firms located outside the 4-hour radius but located in North Carolina and with current and established relationships with local contractors within the 4-hour response window; rated as acceptable; (3) firms located out of state but with current and existing established relationships with local contractors within the 4-hour response window; rated as acceptable; (4) firms located out of state and no apparent current relationships in local area; rated as unacceptable - and as such the entire submittal will be rejected as unacceptable. <br><br>Price lists or labor rates shall be shown for the trades as applicable to this solicitation/synopsis. <br><br>FACTOR 2: TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES.  <br><br>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's narrative on proposed capabilities in terms of maintenance and repair considerations and the Offeror's approach to meeting requirements as described in the PWS. <br><br>Discuss, by trades, the approach required for all requirements of work, demonstrating the Offeror's understanding of the PWS. Discussions shall also address the firm's capability to respond and perform repair and maintenance functions, as applicable.  Greater consideration will be given to those Offerors who, as a function of their firm, primarily perform the type of work requirements as described in the PWS for the type of BPA being solicited. For example, a solicitation/synopsis for a Plumbing BPA would be directed to firms who do plumbing work as a primary function of their business or plumbing is one of several major operations within the firm. A firm operating as a management oversight or pass thru type operation is less favorable for the intended BPA. <br><br>The Government will evaluate the capabilities submitted to ensure the Offeror has considered all requirements as listed in the PWS, to include response times and primary trade functions of the proposed firm.  The Government will give greater consideration on work performed as a primary or self-performing contractor than as a management or oversight firm with respect to the type of BPA being solicited. The order of precedence for consideration is as follows: (1) firm has a primary function as self-performing in the functions of the PWS; rated as highly acceptable; (2) firm performs at least 50% work of the PWS and sub-contracts the rest to one specific firm in performance of the PWS; rated as acceptable; (3) firm is a multi-functional firm that performs at least 25% of the work and oversees other contractors in performance of the PWS; rated as acceptable; (4) firm operates completely as a pass-thru or management over-sight firm; rated unacceptable - and as such the entire submittal will be rejected as unacceptable.<br><br>FACTOR 3: PAST PERFORMANCE/SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE. <br><br>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: Offerors shall be evaluated on their recent, relevant experience with experience similar in size, scope and complexity to the scope of work for this BPA. Past performance refers to the extent and quality of recent, relevant experience, from a subjective perspective. Offerors shall be evaluated on similar type services and/or work completed or in progress in the last five years that are same and/or similar in nature to the BPA requirements being solicited. Offerors shall provide their team's recent, relevant experience with work similar in size, scope and complexity to the requirements in the PWS. Each firm will be rated on its own performance; a firm may not solely establish past performance based on the past performance of a proposed sub-contractor or firm, apart from that of the firm if the firm was acting in an oversight management type function. The Offeror's past performance will be evaluated to determine technical capability to perform the proposed services described in the BPA PWS. The information presented in the Offeror's submittal, together with that from other sources available to the Government (such as CPARS) will comprise the input for evaluation of this factor.  <br><br>The Offeror shall provide project information on at least three (3) but no more than five (5) completed or current in-progress service type examples (preferably BPA's or other maintenance service contracts) within the last five (5) years that best represent their experience relevant to the PWS for this BPA. As a minimum, provide the data as specified in the Past Performance Information (PPI) format shown in the following paragraph as part of the narrative submittal. This is a predominate method of evaluating past performance along with any accompanying narrative for that particular example. <br><br>COMPANY PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION (PPI) NARRATIVE for HVAC SYSTEMS & CONTROLS SERVICES FORT BRAGG AND POPE AIR FORCE BASE REGIONAL SCHOOLS<br> NORTH CAROLINA<br><br>Use this suggested format as a guide per each example submitted. (This information along with the Supplemental Narrative shall be a maximum of two (2) pages.) <br><br>Firm's Name Accomplishing Work	<br>Type of Work 	<br>Location of Work	<br><br>General Scope of Work	<br><br>Role (Prime, Joint Venture, Subcontractor, etc.) and Work Your Company Self-Performed (with % performed):	<br><br>Describe Relevancy to this Requirement	<br><br><br>Cost (Dollar Value of Effort)	<br><br>Contracting Officer and/or Owner's Point of Contact for Reference<br>Name	<br>Company	<br>Telephone	<br><br>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance to determine how relevant it is to the intended services being solicited. Work will be considered relevant to this effort if they are similar in complexity, type, scope, and/or magnitude. More relevant past performance will typically be a stronger predictor of future success and have more influence on the past performance assessment than past performance of lesser relevance. Relevant qualifiers include past governmental service agreements or contracts, experience in line with PWS description, and work on the Fort Bragg & Pope Air Force Base Regional Schools, North Carolina. The order of precedence for consideration is as follows: (1) PPI and supplemental narrative with three (3) - five (5) relevant examples to the PWS; rated as highly acceptable; (2) PPI only with three (3) - five (5) relevant examples to the PWS; rated as acceptable; (3) narrative only; rated as marginal; (4) no minimum examples or non-relevant experience will be rated as unacceptable and as such the entire submittal will be rejected as unacceptable.<br><br>Government type service past performance will be given greater consideration than non-Federal Government past performance. Recent and relevant work in and around the Fort Bragg & Pope Air Force Base Regional Schools, North Carolina will be greater consideration than other experience in other areas. The Government will consider previous experience at the schools for which these BPA's will cover value added strength.  <br><br>QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP)<br>BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENT<br>FOR<br>HVAC SYSTEMS & CONTROLS SERVICE<br> FORT BRAGG AND POPE AIR FORCE BASE REGIONAL SCHOOLS<br> NORTH CAROLINA<br><br>9 July 2012<br><br>1.0 GENERAL<br><br>1.1 Description of Services: This QASP will establish oversight and surveillance for the Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) established for HVAC Systems & Controls Service per the Performance Work Statement (PWS) shown below for the DDESS schools located at Ft Bragg/Pope AFB Region of North Carolina. This plan sets forth the procedures and guidelines that the Corps of Engineers Southwest Fort Worth (SWF) will use in ensuring the required performance standards or services levels are achieved by the contractor.<br><br>1.1. Work Requiring Surveillance: The Contractors shall, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the awarded BPA IDIQ, and more particularly, in each individually placed call for work, provide all personnel, labor, plant, equipment, parts, tools, supplies, management, transportation and other items necessary to perform but not limited to provide installation, replacement,  preventative maintenance, scheduled maintenance, inspection services, emergency and repair services, schedule/demand services, state and federal required inspections to properly maintain HVAC systems and equipment and associated controls for heating, air conditioning, and ventilation that also includes the Metasys Energy Management Control System (EMCS), as well as disposal of equipment and materials. <br><br>2.0 PURPOSE<br><br>2.1 The purpose of the QASP is to describe the systematic methods used to monitor performance and to identify the required documentation and the resources to be employed.  The QASP provides a means for evaluating whether the contractor is meeting the performance standards identified in the PWS to ensure that the government pays only for the level of services received.  <br><br>2.2 This QASP defines the roles and responsibilities of all members of the integrated delivery team (IDT), identifies the performance objectives, defines the methodologies used to monitor and evaluate the contractor's performance, describes quality assurance documentation requirements, and describes the analysis of quality assurance monitoring results.<br><br>3.0 Performance Management Approach<br><br>3.1 The PWS structures the acquisition around "what" service or quality level is required, as opposed to "how" the contractor should perform the work (i.e., performance not prescriptive). This QASP will define the performance management approach taken by the COR to monitor and manage the contractor's performance to ensure the expected outcomes or performance objectives communicated in the PWS are achieved.  Performance management rests on developing a capability to review and analyze information generated through performance assessment. The ability to make decisions based on the analysis of performance data is the cornerstone of performance management; this analysis yields information that indicates whether expected outcomes for the project are being achieved by the contractor. <br><br>3.2 Performance management represents a significant shift from the more traditional quality assurance (QA) concepts in several ways. Performance management focuses on assessing whether outcomes are being achieved and to what extent. This approach migrates away from scrutiny of compliance with the processes and practices used to achieve the outcome. A performance-based approach enables the contractor to play a large role in how the work is performed, as long as the proposed processes are within the stated constraints. The only exceptions to process reviews are those required by law (federal, state, and local) and compelling business situations, such as safety and health. A "results" focus provides the contractor flexibility to continuously improve and innovate over the course of the BPA as long as the critical outcomes expected are being achieved and/or the desired performance levels are being met.<br><br>4.0 Performance Management Strategy<br><br>4.1 The contractor is responsible for the quality of all work performed. The contractor measures that quality through the contractor's own quality control (QC) program. QC is work output, not workers, and therefore includes all work performed under this BPA regardless of whether the work is performed by contractor employees or by subcontractors. The contractor will engage in performance management to assess and monitor its own performance. The contractor will perform self-inspection for quality, timeliness, responsiveness, customer satisfaction, and other performance requirements.  <br><br>4.2 The Government representative(s) will monitor performance to determine how the contractor is performing against industry norms. The contractor will be responsible for making required changes in processes and practices to ensure performance is executed and managed effectively.<br><br>5.0 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES<br><br>5.1 The Contracting Officer (KO). The Contracting Officer (KO) is responsible for monitoring compliance to the terms of the BPA and the individual orders (calls), administration, and cost control and for resolving any differences between the observations documented by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and the contractor. The KO will designate a COR as the Government authority for performance management. The number of additional representatives serving as technical inspectors depends on the complexity of the services measured, as well as the contractor's performance, and must be identified and designated by the KO.<br><br>5.2 The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR is designated in writing by the KO to act as his or her authorized representative to assist in administering the individual orders (calls) issued under this BPA. COR limitations are contained in the written appointment letter. The COR is responsible for technical administration of the project and ensures proper Government surveillance of the contractor's performance. The COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the Government's behalf. Any changes that the contractor deems may affect awarded price of an order (call), terms, or conditions shall be referred to the KO for action.  The COR will have the responsibility for evaluation of the contractor's work performance.  Government surveillance may occur under the inspection of services clause for any service relating to this BPA.<br><br>5.3 Ordering Officers. The Ordering Officer is designated in writing by the KO to act as his or her authorized representative to administer the BPA and the individual orders (calls). The ordering officer will be a designated school official that will maintain a BPA log, BPA call file, and be authorized to place orders (calls) up to the limit established by the KO in writing. The ordering officer may also confirm the satisfactory completion of work and request payment of submitted invoices for completed work. <br><br>6.0 IDENTIFICATION OF REQUIRED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, QUALITY LEVELS & PAYMENTS<br><br>The required performance standards and/or quality levels are included in the PWS (attachment 1) and "Performance Requirements Summary" (attachment 2).  If the contractor meets the required service or performance level, it will be paid the amount agreed on in the order (call).  Failure to meet the required service or performance level may result in a payment delay or deduction from the requested invoice amount.<br><br>Payment and Corrective Action:  Full payment for a BPA order (call) will be provided upon verification of overall acceptable performance by the DDESS BPA COR at the school, as rated on quality, timeliness and cost.  This verification will be recorded in a simplified performance evaluation form submitted to the KO and PM rating overall performance with a recommendation for payment. (Attachment 3)<br><br>6.1 METHODOLOGIES TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE<br><br>6.1.1 Surveillance Techniques. In an effort to minimize the performance management burden, simplified surveillance methods shall be used by the Government to evaluate contractor performance when appropriate. The primary methods of surveillance are:  (1) Random monitoring and/or (2) 100% Inspection. <br><br>Since each BPA order (call) is a Firm-Fixed-Price Contract, the Contractor's performance will be evaluated by assessing the milestones and deliverables associated with each individual order (call) according to two standards: quality and timeliness.  For each of these performance standards, the COR will assign one of three ratings to the A-E's performance: superior, acceptable, or unacceptable as shown in Attachment 2.  <br><br>6.1.2 Communications. The contractor is expected to establish and maintain professional communication between its employees and customers. The primary objective of this communication is customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is the most significant external indicator of the success and effectiveness of all services provided and can be measured through customer complaints. Performance management drives the contractor to be customer focused through initially and internally addressing customer complaints and investigating the issues and/or problems but the customer always has the option to communicate complaints to the COR or KO as opposed to the contractor. <br><br>6.1.3 Customer complaints, to be considered valid, must set forth clearly and in writing the detailed nature of the complaint, must be signed, and must be forwarded to the COR or KO. <br>Customer feedback may also be obtained either from the results of formal customer satisfaction surveys or from random customer complaints. <br><br>6.2 Acceptable Quality Levels <br><br>The acceptable quality levels (AQLs) included in Attachment 2, Performance Requirements Summary Table, for contractor performance are structured to allow the contractor to manage how the work is performed while providing processes for performance shortfalls. QUALITY <br><br>6.3 ASSURANCE DOCUMENTATION<br><br>6.3.1 Performance Management Feedback Loop. The performance management feedback loop begins with the communication of expected outcomes. Performance standards are expressed in the PWS and assessed using the performance monitoring techniques shown in Attachment 2.  <br><br>6.3.2 Monitoring Forms. The Government's surveillance will be annotated using the monitoring forms in Attachments 3. The forms, when completed, will document the Government's assessment of the contractor's performance under the individual orders (calls) to ensure that the required results are being achieved. The form will be maintained in the BPA file at the school. <br><br><br>6.4 ANALYSIS OF QUALITY ASSURANCE ASSESSMENT<br><br>6.4.1 Determining Performance. Government shall use the monitoring methods cited in paragraph 6.1.1 to determine whether the performance service levels have been met. If the contractor has not met the minimum requirements, a corrective action plan may need to be developed to show how and by what date performance is intended to be brought up to the required levels. <br><br>6.4.2 Reporting<br><br>At the completion of each individual order (call), the COR will prepare a written report for summarizing the overall results of the contractor's performance.  This written report, which may be the just the completed quality assurance monitoring form (Attachment 3), will become part of the BPA documentation file.  It will aid in the yearly required evaluation of the BPA contractor thru the CPARS. The COR must coordinate and communicate with the contractor and the KO to resolve issues and concerns regarding marginal or unacceptable performance and must should be clearly documented. <br><br>Point of contact is Tiffany Brooks at Tiffany.S.Brooks@usace.army.mil.  A solicitation will not be issued. Oral explanations or instructions will not be provided and any information given to an offeror(s) will be given in the form of a written amendment to the solicitation/synopsis to all offerors.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> In the vicinity of the Santa Ana River areas described in paragraph 2 above, the drilling contractor (Contractor) will drill and sample approximately four (4) soil borings to a depth of one-hundred (100) feet and approximately ten (10) soil borings to between thirty (30) and fifty (50) feet below the existing ground surface. Hollow-stem augers (HSA) are the preferred method of drilling. The soils consist primarily of sands, silts, and some clay with gravel and occasional boulders.  Bedrock may be encountered in some of the holes, in which case drilling will be terminated. Groundwater may be encountered in some or all of the holes, and heaving/flowing sands are likely in the deeper holes. In the event that groundwater and/or heaving sands prevent the use of hollow-stem augers to reach total depth, the driller, at the direction of the Corps geologist, shall be prepared to convert from hollow-stem augering to the  quote mark wet quote mark  rotary drilling method through the HSA in order to advance a hole to its required depth.  In addition to HSA drilling, the contractor will excavate approximately fifteen (15) test pits to a depth of twelve (12) feet with a backhoe or excavator to enable the geologist to log the test pits and collect bulk soil samples for laboratory testing.

PROJECT INFORMATION:<BR><BR>	The Historic Area Remediation Site (HARS) is an area designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for remediation due to the presence of contaminated dredged material associated with historic dumping activities.  The HARS is being remediated with uncontaminated, Category I dredged material by placement of at least a 1-meter thick sediment cap.  A Site Management and Monitoring Plan (SMMP) developed for the HARS, encompasses, through tiered selection criteria, precision bathymetric surveying, side-scan sonar analysis, sub-bottom seismic profiling, surface and subsurface sediment collection and analysis (photography, benthic community structure analysis, grain size, chemical characteristics and toxicity, bio-assays and bio-accumulation studies), water quality analysis, oceanographic and sedimentological process studies.  The SMMP is being used as a guideline to manage placement of dredged material at the HARS, to ensure efficient construction of the 1-meter sediment cap, and to monitor changes at the HARS while remediation activities occur and, ultimately, to ensure remediation has been completed.  The USACE New York District (CENAN) is responsible for contracting and overseeing the various activities described in the SMMP.  A revised HARS SMMP was recently approved and will be used as the guide for all HARS monitoring activities.  Alternative locations for ocean placement of dredged materials may be necessary after HARS remediation is completed and it may be necessary to investigate alternatives during the final years of HARS remediation.<BR>	<BR>This contract will be used to complete the activities described in the HARS SMMP and related activities in a timely, technically sound, and cost effective manner.  Additionally, this contract will allow data collection associated with investigation of future sites for ocean placement of dredged materials in the New York Bight.  Artificial reefs used for placement of dredged rock may also be monitored through this contract.  New York District is issuing this solicitation for award of one (1) contract.  This contract must maintain data continuity between previous work at the HARS and all subsequent data collection, in particular, maintaining compatibility with the Dredging Analysis Network for New York District (DAN-NY) computer database, as well as the ability to complete tasks on short notice and within limited periods of performance.  Task orders issued against this contract will be utilized for collection and analysis of data associated with activities described in the HARS SMMP and related activities from areas within and/or adjacent to the HARS, and the New York Bight, including: (1) conducting high-resolution multi-beam bathymetric surveys, (2) conducting side-scan sonar surveys, (3) collecting photographs of the sediment surface and sediment profiles using SPI technology, (4) collecting and analyzing sediment vibra-cores, (5) collecting bottom sediment samples for shipment to an approved laboratory for toxicity analysis, (6) collecting basic oceanographic data within the New York Bight, (7) collecting surface and sub-surface sediment samples for shipment to an approved laboratory for chemical analysis, and (8) conducting benthic community structure analyses. <BR><BR>Special qualifications include, but are not limited to: capability and experience with; precision hydrographic surveying, sediment profile imagery collection and analysis, geotechnical data collection and analysis, monitoring of marine habitats, environmental testing and analysis, GIS use and formatting of GIS data, GIS metadata preparation, and preparation of studies and reports.  The contractor must be familiar with current U.S. Army Corps of Engineers regulations, guidelines, and procedures.  The contractor must also have the capability to manage and supervise other contractors and demonstrate the ability to handle the large volume of work under strict deadlines.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br /></p>

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Senior Program Manager will support USAID's Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) Middle East regional activities as member of the OTI Middle East (ME) Team.  This position is a supervisory position requiring that the incumbent work in coordination with the Regional Team Leader to establish an effective team.  Individually, they must be able to set staff goals and objectives, delegate tasks, create a supportive working relationship, ensure a motivating work environment, and understand and support diversity.</p>
<p>This Senior Program Manager will report to the Middle East Regional Team Leader or designee. The position is Washington, D.C. based, but must be available for frequent and possibly long-term temporary duty assignments to the Syria region. While on these assignments the incumbent might have to live in temporary quarters or in hotels for extended periods.</p>
<p>The Senior Program Manager's principal responsibility is to manage the Washington unit supporting DCHA/OTI's Syria country program. This unit will consist of permanent and temporary staffing of up to five USPSC Program Managers, Program Assistants and Program Administrative Assistants. Additionally, the incumbent will be expected to develop and maintain collaborative and productive relationships with counterparts throughout the Agency and Inter-Agency.</p>
<p>The OTI program in the Syria region supports the larger objectives of the U.S. Government to promote stability and democracy in Syria by providing assistance to support the political transition. In close coordination with the State Department representatives and other USG actors and with consideration of USG priorities, OTI's rapid and targeted programs will address emerging issues and empower local partners potentially to include non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, media outlets, and local and national government offices to reduce or mitigate conflict, increase transparency and accountability, and foster positive political change.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />OBJECTIVE</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Keep in mind that it takes 48-72 hours for the registration process in SAM to be complete. The SAM website is located at https://sam.gov/.</p>

All vendors are required to fill out and submit the DD2345 form. Instructions for submission of that form can be found in that link as well.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

<DESC>Q1. Does the vessel have to be a US flagged vessel?<br />A1. Vessel does not have to be a US flagged vessel.
<p>Q2. Will the Science team be flying direct into Dili and boarding the vessel? Or will they board out of Darwin?<br />A2. Science team will meet the vessel in Timor-Leste in the vicinity of the city of Dili.</p>
<p>Q3. Will the Chief Scientist, Contractor and vessel Captain or owner be able to conduct planning meetings well before the trip to discuss the general plan?<br />A3. Phone conferences will be arranged to discuss the general plan.<br />Note that field operations may commence as early as 1JUN which allows for limited pre-mission discussion. Successful vendors should be able to demonstrate experience or ability to operate in the areas of interest.</p>
<p>Q4. Should an emergency occur on the vessel to one of the divers/crew will the vessel still be required to conduct normal operations that day while simultaneously transporting the patient to Dili and then on to the nearest suitable medical facility? Or will vessel be considered "off-Charter" and operations halted?<br />A4. In the event of a life-threatening emergency, the primary concern will be patient safety. If halting or altering operations will contribute to a higher probability of a favorable patient outcome, then that course of action would be expected. After the patient has been delivered to a medical facility, a review by the Contracting Officer regarding the nature of the emergency and who was affected would occur, if necessary, to determine if and when the vessel was off-charter.</p>
<p>Q5. Will, at least, a US registered RN or paramedic be required to be onboard the vessel to provide medical attention the entire time? Or is basic first aid/CPR all that's required.<br />A5. A US registered RN or paramedic is not required to be onboard the vessel.</p>
<p>Q6. Is it realistic to assume that the vessel may need to support multiple overnight accommodations and food for the science team because of the distance from Dili to the possible site locations?<br />A6. The vessel will only be engaged in support of day-time scuba operations at the regions specified in the Statement of Work. For survey sites away from Dili, the science team will make arrangements for their own accommodations and food. Depending on the type of vessel and the number of crew, arrangements for land-based accommodations for the vessel crew could be coordinated with the science party. Each morning, the charter vessel will be expected to meet and embark the science team at a designated location near the survey site. Note: There are two solicitations currently being advertised for Dive<br />Support in Timor-Leste. The Q&amp;A you are currently reading is for the land-based day-charters</p>
<p>Q7. Will the vessel be required to provide Dive tank air filling on board?<br />A7. The vessel will not be required to provide dive tank air filling on board. The science team will arrange for tank and tank fills. Tanks will be loaded each morning when scientists embark.</p>
<p>Q8. Has this particular study been done in the past, or one with very similar criteria, in that region and, if so, which vessel and crew was used to do this work? Essentially is there a vessel that has been involved with this type of work in that region for you in the past?<br />A8. The requirements of this mission are unique. We will review the capabilities/price of all proposed vessels.</p>
<p>Q9. Will an approving authority travel at their own expense in advance to inspect the vessel and it's crew? Will the contractor be expected to accompany the NOAA inspector?<br />A9. The vessel will need to meet the safety standards under which the scientific staff have to operate. These include those set forth by the University of Hawaii Marine Center and the NOAA Small Boat Program. Specifications, certifications, and photographs of the proposed vessel will likely allow an initial determination to be made. It is expected that a member of the scientific party, with boating expertise, will provide an on-site inspection and a daily safety inspection.</p>
<p>Q10. Is the intent to have the 8 days of work concurrent or will there be specific non-work days built in? Or, is the intent to have the vessel available the entire month of June?<br />A10. The intent is to have 8 days of concurrent work.</p>
<p>Q11. In the event of unsafe weather and/or sea state, can a &lsquo;standby' rate be budgeted for?<br />A11. When comparing proposals, the overall charter rate will be considered. However, the RFQ asks that all vendors provide details of their cancellation policy.</p>
<p>Q12. Will any permits, licensing, country approval requirements for this work be the responsibility of the contractor? The vessel? Or NOAA?<br />A12. All vessel operations, including permits, in-country approvals,etc. are the responsibility of the provider. See the SOW.</p>
<p>Q13. Do you have any security concerns that either contractor or the vessel operator need to address?<br />A13. We do not understand the question. Please elaborate.</p>

This announcement is to solicit interest for the establishment of a BPA and will be the only solicitation/synopsis to be issued for this service. Responses are requested and additional solicitations or synopses will not be issued. In support of the Small Business Association and DoD Congressionally mandated small business goals, this is a Small Business set aside announcement. It is the intention of the Government to award a minimum of three (3) Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to those firms who demonstrate they are capable of providing services to the DDESS area of operation as identified by the requirements in this document, but the Government reserves the right to make a single award from this solicitation/synopsis. The Government reserves the right to make an award on initial responses received. The Government reserves the right to enter into discussions if necessary. The BPA duration will be for a one-year base period and may be extended in one-year increments not to exceed a total of three-years for the BPA. The establishment of the BPA does not imply any agreement on the part of the Government to place future calls, orders or contracts with the BPA holder. The Government makes no representation as to the number of calls or actual amount of work to be ordered. Interested firms must identify their interest and capability to perform to the requirements set forth in this solicitation/synopsis to be considered for award of the solicited BPAs. The awarded BPA will be an agreement capable of fulfilling the requirements of performance for DoDEA/DDESS as stated in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and through-out the complete period of performance as established by the specific award. No calls will exceed the amount of $150,000.  The aggregate amount of the BPA will be approximately $200,000 per year with a total maximum of $500,000 for the total three-year duration of all options.  ALL QUOTES ARE TO BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT. <br><br>The Government will evaluate all submitted responses in accordance with the submissions and evaluation criteria described herein as part of a Single-Step Solicitation Process.

Material omissions may cause the technical proposal to be rejected as unacceptable. Submissions that tend to be vague, generic, or lacking detail may be considered unacceptable. The failure to include information requested in the individual factors may result in the offer being found deficient and therefore unacceptable. The Government cannot make award based on a deficient or unacceptable offer. Receipt of an "Unacceptable" determination of acceptability for any factor will make the offer ineligible for award, unless the Government elects to enter discussions and deficiencies are remedied in a revised proposal. <br><br>FACTOR 1:  BUSINESS TYPE/CLASSIFICATION & FIRM INFORMATION. <br><br>GENERAL: It is the objective of this solicitation/synopsis to give priority consideration to those firms who are classified as (1) Small Business per SBA identifications, (2) meet the qualifications as established by the Small Business Administration and (3) preference to firms located in the Ft Bragg area. All Offeror's shall provide a narrative detailing their small business status as well as the firm's information as requested in this solicitation/synopsis.  Firms shall detail their level of self performance for the required work and the level of all sub-contractors. Joint Venture partners should each demonstrate experience commensurate with their roles and explain in the subject narrative how their experience qualifies them for their role for these BPA's. The narrative shall also include the role and participation of each partner.<br><br> Included in this Factor is the requirement to submit price-lists and/or labor rates. <br><br>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's narrative on the requirements as described herein. <br><br>The Business Type/Classification & Firm information narrative shall describe the Offeror's status as a small business, large business, joint venture, etc. The narrative shall list the SAM registration status (with current date or expiration), DUNS number and Cage Code as well as the NAICS codes as applicable. (A copy of the SAM page can be included as an attachment to this Factor for expedient review but is not required and if included, will not count as to the total page count for this factor.) If the Offeror identifies themselves as a small business, the classification as defined by the SBA - that is, Women Owned, 8a, Service Disabled, etc. <br><br>The narrative shall include all information relevant to the firm as to address and primary office location, address of secondary or sub-contractor offices, telephone numbers, size, required certifications for applicable trades, and any other pertinent information directly related to the nature of the firm being submitted - that is, management-oversight, self-performing, etc.  More consideration will be given to those Offeror's who are self performing - that is, the primary business function of the firm is relevant to the PWS of this solicitation/synopsis. <br><br>Each firm submitting will be evaluated on a Go/No-Go basis for meeting SBA classification status. Priority consideration will be given to those firms who are classified as Small Business and meet the qualifications as established by the Small Business Administration. Any business not identified by classification in the submittal or identified as a Large Business will receive a No-Go determination. <br><br>The order of precedence for locality consideration is as follows: (1) those firms who are located within a 4-hour radius of Ft Bragg/Pope AFB regional school District will be given the highest consideration; rated as highly acceptable; (2) firms located outside the 4-hour radius but located in North Carolina and with current and established relationships with local contractors within the 4-hour response window; rated as acceptable; (3) firms located out of state but with current and existing established relationships with local contractors within the 4-hour response window; rated as acceptable; (4) firms located out of state and no apparent current relationships in local area; rated as unacceptable - and as such the entire submittal will be rejected as unacceptable. <br><br>Price lists or labor rates shall be shown for the trades as applicable to this solicitation/synopsis. <br><br>FACTOR 2: TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES.  <br><br>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's narrative on proposed capabilities in terms of maintenance and repair considerations and the Offeror's approach to meeting requirements as described in the PWS. <br><br>Discuss, by trades, the approach required for all requirements of work, demonstrating the Offeror's understanding of the PWS. Discussions shall also address the firm's capability to respond and perform repair and maintenance functions, as applicable.  Greater consideration will be given to those Offerors who, as a function of their firm, primarily perform the type of work requirements as described in the PWS for the type of BPA being solicited. For example, a solicitation/synopsis for a Plumbing BPA would be directed to firms who do plumbing work as a primary function of their business or plumbing is one of several major operations within the firm. A firm operating as a management oversight or pass thru type operation is less favorable for the intended BPA. <br><br>The Government will evaluate the capabilities submitted to ensure the Offeror has considered all requirements as listed in the PWS, to include response times and primary trade functions of the proposed firm.  The Government will give greater consideration on work performed as a primary or self-performing contractor than as a management or oversight firm with respect to the type of BPA being solicited. The order of precedence for consideration is as follows: (1) firm has a primary function as self-performing in the functions of the PWS; rated as highly acceptable; (2) firm performs at least 50% work of the PWS and sub-contracts the rest to one specific firm in performance of the PWS; rated as acceptable; (3) firm is a multi-functional firm that performs at least 25% of the work and oversees other contractors in performance of the PWS; rated as acceptable; (4) firm operates completely as a pass-thru or management over-sight firm; rated unacceptable - and as such the entire submittal will be rejected as unacceptable.<br><br>FACTOR 3: PAST PERFORMANCE/SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE. <br><br>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: Offerors shall be evaluated on their recent, relevant experience with experience similar in size, scope and complexity to the scope of work for this BPA. Past performance refers to the extent and quality of recent, relevant experience, from a subjective perspective. Offerors shall be evaluated on similar type services and/or work completed or in progress in the last five years that are same and/or similar in nature to the BPA requirements being solicited. Offerors shall provide their team's recent, relevant experience with work similar in size, scope and complexity to the requirements in the PWS. Each firm will be rated on its own performance; a firm may not solely establish past performance based on the past performance of a proposed sub-contractor or firm, apart from that of the firm if the firm was acting in an oversight management type function. The Offeror's past performance will be evaluated to determine technical capability to perform the proposed services described in the BPA PWS. The information presented in the Offeror's submittal, together with that from other sources available to the Government (such as CPARS) will comprise the input for evaluation of this factor.  <br><br>The Offeror shall provide project information on at least three (3) but no more than five (5) completed or current in-progress service type examples (preferably BPA's or other maintenance service contracts) within the last five (5) years that best represent their experience relevant to the PWS for this BPA. As a minimum, provide the data as specified in the Past Performance Information (PPI) format shown in the following paragraph as part of the narrative submittal. This is a predominate method of evaluating past performance along with any accompanying narrative for that particular example. <br><br>COMPANY PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION (PPI) NARRATIVE for HVAC SYSTEMS & CONTROLS SERVICES FORT BRAGG AND POPE AIR FORCE BASE REGIONAL SCHOOLS<br> NORTH CAROLINA<br><br>Use this suggested format as a guide per each example submitted.

Work will be considered relevant to this effort if they are similar in complexity, type, scope, and/or magnitude. More relevant past performance will typically be a stronger predictor of future success and have more influence on the past performance assessment than past performance of lesser relevance. Relevant qualifiers include past governmental service agreements or contracts, experience in line with PWS description, and work on the Fort Bragg & Pope Air Force Base Regional Schools, North Carolina. The order of precedence for consideration is as follows: (1) PPI and supplemental narrative with three (3) - five (5) relevant examples to the PWS; rated as highly acceptable; (2) PPI only with three (3) - five (5) relevant examples to the PWS; rated as acceptable; (3) narrative only; rated as marginal; (4) no minimum examples or non-relevant experience will be rated as unacceptable and as such the entire submittal will be rejected as unacceptable.<br><br>Government type service past performance will be given greater consideration than non-Federal Government past performance. Recent and relevant work in and around the Fort Bragg & Pope Air Force Base Regional Schools, North Carolina will be greater consideration than other experience in other areas. The Government will consider previous experience at the schools for which these BPA's will cover value added strength.  <br><br>QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP)<br>BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENT<br>FOR<br>HVAC SYSTEMS & CONTROLS SERVICE<br> FORT BRAGG AND POPE AIR FORCE BASE REGIONAL SCHOOLS<br> NORTH CAROLINA<br><br>9 July 2012<br><br>1.0 GENERAL<br><br>1.1 Description of Services: This QASP will establish oversight and surveillance for the Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) established for HVAC Systems & Controls Service per the Performance Work Statement (PWS) shown below for the DDESS schools located at Ft Bragg/Pope AFB Region of North Carolina. This plan sets forth the procedures and guidelines that the Corps of Engineers Southwest Fort Worth (SWF) will use in ensuring the required performance standards or services levels are achieved by the contractor.<br><br>1.1. Work Requiring Surveillance: The Contractors shall, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the awarded BPA IDIQ, and more particularly, in each individually placed call for work, provide all personnel, labor, plant, equipment, parts, tools, supplies, management, transportation and other items necessary to perform but not limited to provide installation, replacement,  preventative maintenance, scheduled maintenance, inspection services, emergency and repair services, schedule/demand services, state and federal required inspections to properly maintain HVAC systems and equipment and associated controls for heating, air conditioning, and ventilation that also includes the Metasys Energy Management Control System (EMCS), as well as disposal of equipment and materials. <br><br>2.0 PURPOSE<br><br>2.1 The purpose of the QASP is to describe the systematic methods used to monitor performance and to identify the required documentation and the resources to be employed.  The QASP provides a means for evaluating whether the contractor is meeting the performance standards identified in the PWS to ensure that the government pays only for the level of services received.  <br><br>2.2 This QASP defines the roles and responsibilities of all members of the integrated delivery team (IDT), identifies the performance objectives, defines the methodologies used to monitor and evaluate the contractor's performance, describes quality assurance documentation requirements, and describes the analysis of quality assurance monitoring results.<br><br>3.0 Performance Management Approach<br><br>3.1 The PWS structures the acquisition around "what" service or quality level is required, as opposed to "how" the contractor should perform the work (i.e., performance not prescriptive). This QASP will define the performance management approach taken by the COR to monitor and manage the contractor's performance to ensure the expected outcomes or performance objectives communicated in the PWS are achieved.  Performance management rests on developing a capability to review and analyze information generated through performance assessment. The ability to make decisions based on the analysis of performance data is the cornerstone of performance management; this analysis yields information that indicates whether expected outcomes for the project are being achieved by the contractor. <br><br>3.2 Performance management represents a significant shift from the more traditional quality assurance (QA) concepts in several ways. Performance management focuses on assessing whether outcomes are being achieved and to what extent. This approach migrates away from scrutiny of compliance with the processes and practices used to achieve the outcome. A performance-based approach enables the contractor to play a large role in how the work is performed, as long as the proposed processes are within the stated constraints. The only exceptions to process reviews are those required by law (federal, state, and local) and compelling business situations, such as safety and health. A "results" focus provides the contractor flexibility to continuously improve and innovate over the course of the BPA as long as the critical outcomes expected are being achieved and/or the desired performance levels are being met.<br><br>4.0 Performance Management Strategy<br><br>4.1 The contractor is responsible for the quality of all work performed. The contractor measures that quality through the contractor's own quality control (QC) program. QC is work output, not workers, and therefore includes all work performed under this BPA regardless of whether the work is performed by contractor employees or by subcontractors. The contractor will engage in performance management to assess and monitor its own performance. The contractor will perform self-inspection for quality, timeliness, responsiveness, customer satisfaction, and other performance requirements.  <br><br>4.2 The Government representative(s) will monitor performance to determine how the contractor is performing against industry norms. The contractor will be responsible for making required changes in processes and practices to ensure performance is executed and managed effectively.<br><br>5.0 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES<br><br>5.1 The Contracting Officer (KO). The Contracting Officer (KO) is responsible for monitoring compliance to the terms of the BPA and the individual orders (calls), administration, and cost control and for resolving any differences between the observations documented by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and the contractor. The KO will designate a COR as the Government authority for performance management. The number of additional representatives serving as technical inspectors depends on the complexity of the services measured, as well as the contractor's performance, and must be identified and designated by the KO.<br><br>5.2 The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR is designated in writing by the KO to act as his or her authorized representative to assist in administering the individual orders (calls) issued under this BPA. COR limitations are contained in the written appointment letter. The COR is responsible for technical administration of the project and ensures proper Government surveillance of the contractor's performance. The COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the Government's behalf. Any changes that the contractor deems may affect awarded price of an order (call), terms, or conditions shall be referred to the KO for action.  The COR will have the responsibility for evaluation of the contractor's work performance.  Government surveillance may occur under the inspection of services clause for any service relating to this BPA.<br><br>5.3 Ordering Officers. The Ordering Officer is designated in writing by the KO to act as his or her authorized representative to administer the BPA and the individual orders (calls). The ordering officer will be a designated school official that will maintain a BPA log, BPA call file, and be authorized to place orders (calls) up to the limit established by the KO in writing. The ordering officer may also confirm the satisfactory completion of work and request payment of submitted invoices for completed work. <br><br>6.0 IDENTIFICATION OF REQUIRED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, QUALITY LEVELS & PAYMENTS<br><br>The required performance standards and/or quality levels are included in the PWS (attachment 1) and "Performance Requirements Summary" (attachment 2).  If the contractor meets the required service or performance level, it will be paid the amount agreed on in the order (call).  Failure to meet the required service or performance level may result in a payment delay or deduction from the requested invoice amount.<br><br>Payment and Corrective Action:  Full payment for a BPA order (call) will be provided upon verification of overall acceptable performance by the DDESS BPA COR at the school, as rated on quality, timeliness and cost.  This verification will be recorded in a simplified performance evaluation form submitted to the KO and PM rating overall performance with a recommendation for payment. (Attachment 3)<br><br>6.1 METHODOLOGIES TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE<br><br>6.1.1 Surveillance Techniques. In an effort to minimize the performance management burden, simplified surveillance methods shall be used by the Government to evaluate contractor performance when appropriate. The primary methods of surveillance are:  (1) Random monitoring and/or (2) 100% Inspection. <br><br>Since each BPA order (call) is a Firm-Fixed-Price Contract, the Contractor's performance will be evaluated by assessing the milestones and deliverables associated with each individual order (call) according to two standards: quality and timeliness.  For each of these performance standards, the COR will assign one of three ratings to the A-E's performance: superior, acceptable, or unacceptable as shown in Attachment 2.  <br><br>6.1.2 Communications. The contractor is expected to establish and maintain professional communication between its employees and customers. The primary objective of this communication is customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is the most significant external indicator of the success and effectiveness of all services provided and can be measured through customer complaints. Performance management drives the contractor to be customer focused through initially and internally addressing customer complaints and investigating the issues and/or problems but the customer always has the option to communicate complaints to the COR or KO as opposed to the contractor. <br><br>6.1.3 Customer complaints, to be considered valid, must set forth clearly and in writing the detailed nature of the complaint, must be signed, and must be forwarded to the COR or KO. <br>Customer feedback may also be obtained either from the results of formal customer satisfaction surveys or from random customer complaints. <br><br>6.2 Acceptable Quality Levels <br><br>The acceptable quality levels (AQLs) included in Attachment 2, Performance Requirements Summary Table, for contractor performance are structured to allow the contractor to manage how the work is performed while providing processes for performance shortfalls. QUALITY <br><br>6.3 ASSURANCE DOCUMENTATION<br><br>6.3.1 Performance Management Feedback Loop. The performance management feedback loop begins with the communication of expected outcomes. Performance standards are expressed in the PWS and assessed using the performance monitoring techniques shown in Attachment 2.  <br><br>6.3.2 Monitoring Forms. The Government's surveillance will be annotated using the monitoring forms in Attachments 3. The forms, when completed, will document the Government's assessment of the contractor's performance under the individual orders (calls) to ensure that the required results are being achieved. The form will be maintained in the BPA file at the school. <br><br><br>6.4 ANALYSIS OF QUALITY ASSURANCE ASSESSMENT<br><br>6.4.1 Determining Performance. Government shall use the monitoring methods cited in paragraph 6.1.1 to determine whether the performance service levels have been met. If the contractor has not met the minimum requirements, a corrective action plan may need to be developed to show how and by what date performance is intended to be brought up to the required levels. <br><br>6.4.2 Reporting<br><br>At the completion of each individual order (call), the COR will prepare a written report for summarizing the overall results of the contractor's performance.  This written report, which may be the just the completed quality assurance monitoring form (Attachment 3), will become part of the BPA documentation file.  It will aid in the yearly required evaluation of the BPA contractor thru the CPARS. The COR must coordinate and communicate with the contractor and the KO to resolve issues and concerns regarding marginal or unacceptable performance and must should be clearly documented. <br><br>Point of contact is Tiffany Brooks at Tiffany.S.Brooks@usace.army.mil.

Material omissions may cause the technical proposal to be rejected as unacceptable. Submissions that tend to be vague, generic, or lacking detail may be considered unacceptable. The failure to include information requested in the individual factors may result in the offer being found deficient and therefore unacceptable. The Government cannot make award based on a deficient or unacceptable offer. Receipt of an "Unacceptable" determination of acceptability for any factor will make the offer ineligible for award, unless the Government elects to enter discussions and deficiencies are remedied in a revised proposal. <br><br>FACTOR 1:  BUSINESS TYPE/CLASSIFICATION & FIRM INFORMATION. <br><br>GENERAL: It is the objective of this solicitation/synopsis to give priority consideration to those firms who are classified as (1) Small Business per SBA identifications, (2) meet the qualifications as established by the Small Business Administration and (3) preference to firms located in the Ft Bragg area. All Offeror's shall provide a narrative detailing their small business status as well as the firm's information as requested in this solicitation/synopsis.  Firms shall detail their level of self performance for the required work and the level of all sub-contractors. Joint Venture partners should each demonstrate experience commensurate with their roles and explain in the subject narrative how their experience qualifies them for their role for these BPA's. The narrative shall also include the role and participation of each partner.<br><br> Included in this Factor is the requirement to submit price-lists and/or labor rates. <br><br>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's narrative on the requirements as described herein. <br><br>The Business Type/Classification & Firm information narrative shall describe the Offeror's status as a small business, large business, joint venture, etc. The narrative shall list the SAM registration status (with current date or expiration), DUNS number and Cage Code as well as the NAICS codes as applicable. (A copy of the SAM page can be included as an attachment to this Factor for expedient review but is not required and if included, will not count as to the total page count for this factor.) If the Offeror identifies themselves as a small business, the classification as defined by the SBA - that is, Women Owned, 8a, Service Disabled, etc. <br><br>The narrative shall include all information relevant to the firm as to address and primary office location, address of secondary or sub-contractor offices, telephone numbers, size, required certifications for applicable trades, and any other pertinent information directly related to the nature of the firm being submitted - that is, management-oversight, self-performing, etc.  More consideration will be given to those Offeror's who are self performing - that is, the primary business function of the firm is relevant to the PWS of this solicitation/synopsis. <br><br>Each firm submitting will be evaluated on a Go/No-Go basis for meeting SBA classification status. Priority consideration will be given to those firms who are classified as Small Business and meet the qualifications as established by the Small Business Administration. Any business not identified by classification in the submittal or identified as a Large Business will receive a No-Go determination. <br><br>The order of precedence for locality consideration is as follows: (1) those firms who are located within a 4-hour radius of Ft Bragg/Pope AFB regional school District will be given the highest consideration; rated as highly acceptable; (2) firms located outside the 4-hour radius but located in North Carolina and with current and established relationships with local contractors within the 4-hour response window; rated as acceptable; (3) firms located out of state but with current and existing established relationships with local contractors within the 4-hour response window; rated as acceptable; (4) firms located out of state and no apparent current relationships in local area; rated as unacceptable - and as such the entire submittal will be rejected as unacceptable. <br><br>Price lists or labor rates shall be shown for the trades as applicable to this solicitation/synopsis. <br><br>FACTOR 2: TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES.  <br><br>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's narrative on proposed capabilities in terms of maintenance and repair considerations and the Offeror's approach to meeting requirements as described in the PWS. <br><br>Discuss, by trades, the approach required for all requirements of work, demonstrating the Offeror's understanding of the PWS. Discussions shall also address the firm's capability to respond and perform repair and maintenance functions, as applicable.  Greater consideration will be given to those Offerors who, as a function of their firm, primarily perform the type of work requirements as described in the PWS for the type of BPA being solicited. For example, a solicitation/synopsis for a Plumbing BPA would be directed to firms who do plumbing work as a primary function of their business or plumbing is one of several major operations within the firm. A firm operating as a management oversight or pass thru type operation is less favorable for the intended BPA. <br><br>The Government will evaluate the capabilities submitted to ensure the Offeror has considered all requirements as listed in the PWS, to include response times and primary trade functions of the proposed firm.  The Government will give greater consideration on work performed as a primary or self-performing contractor than as a management or oversight firm with respect to the type of BPA being solicited. The order of precedence for consideration is as follows: (1) firm has a primary function as self-performing in the functions of the PWS; rated as highly acceptable; (2) firm performs at least 50% work of the PWS and sub-contracts the rest to one specific firm in performance of the PWS; rated as acceptable; (3) firm is a multi-functional firm that performs at least 25% of the work and oversees other contractors in performance of the PWS; rated as acceptable; (4) firm operates completely as a pass-thru or management over-sight firm; rated unacceptable - and as such the entire submittal will be rejected as unacceptable.<br><br>FACTOR 3: PAST PERFORMANCE/SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE. <br><br>SUBMISSION AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: Offerors shall be evaluated on their recent, relevant experience with experience similar in size, scope and complexity to the scope of work for this BPA. Past performance refers to the extent and quality of recent, relevant experience, from a subjective perspective. Offerors shall be evaluated on similar type services and/or work completed or in progress in the last five years that are same and/or similar in nature to the BPA requirements being solicited. Offerors shall provide their team's recent, relevant experience with work similar in size, scope and complexity to the requirements in the PWS. Each firm will be rated on its own performance; a firm may not solely establish past performance based on the past performance of a proposed sub-contractor or firm, apart from that of the firm if the firm was acting in an oversight management type function. The Offeror's past performance will be evaluated to determine technical capability to perform the proposed services described in the BPA PWS. The information presented in the Offeror's submittal, together with that from other sources available to the Government (such as CPARS) will comprise the input for evaluation of this factor.  <br><br>The Offeror shall provide project information on at least three (3) but no more than five (5) completed or current in-progress service type examples (preferably BPA's or other maintenance service contracts) within the last five (5) years that best represent their experience relevant to the PWS for this BPA. As a minimum, provide the data as specified in the Past Performance Information (PPI) format shown in the following paragraph as part of the narrative submittal. This is a predominate method of evaluating past performance along with any accompanying narrative for that particular example. <br><br>COMPANY PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION (PPI) NARRATIVE for HVAC SYSTEMS & CONTROLS SERVICES FORT BRAGG AND POPE AIR FORCE BASE REGIONAL SCHOOLS<br> NORTH CAROLINA<br><br>Use this suggested format as a guide per each example submitted. (This information along with the Supplemental Narrative shall be a maximum of two (2) pages.) <br><br>Firm's Name Accomplishing Work	<br>Type of Work 	<br>Location of Work	<br><br>General Scope of Work	<br><br>Role (Prime, Joint Venture, Subcontractor, etc.) and Work Your Company Self-Performed (with % performed):	<br><br>Describe Relevancy to this Requirement	<br><br><br>Cost (Dollar Value of Effort)	<br><br>Contracting Officer and/or Owner's Point of Contact for Reference<br>Name	<br>Company	<br>Telephone	<br><br>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance to determine how relevant it is to the intended services being solicited. Work will be considered relevant to this effort if they are similar in complexity, type, scope, and/or magnitude. More relevant past performance will typically be a stronger predictor of future success and have more influence on the past performance assessment than past performance of lesser relevance. Relevant qualifiers include past governmental service agreements or contracts, experience in line with PWS description, and work on the Fort Bragg & Pope Air Force Base Regional Schools, North Carolina. The order of precedence for consideration is as follows: (1) PPI and supplemental narrative with three (3) - five (5) relevant examples to the PWS; rated as highly acceptable; (2) PPI only with three (3) - five (5) relevant examples to the PWS; rated as acceptable; (3) narrative only; rated as marginal; (4) no minimum examples or non-relevant experience will be rated as unacceptable and as such the entire submittal will be rejected as unacceptable.<br><br>Government type service past performance will be given greater consideration than non-Federal Government past performance. Recent and relevant work in and around the Fort Bragg & Pope Air Force Base Regional Schools, North Carolina will be greater consideration than other experience in other areas. The Government will consider previous experience at the schools for which these BPA's will cover value added strength.  <br><br>QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP)<br>BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENT<br>FOR<br>HVAC SYSTEMS & CONTROLS SERVICE<br> FORT BRAGG AND POPE AIR FORCE BASE REGIONAL SCHOOLS<br> NORTH CAROLINA<br><br>9 July 2012<br><br>1.0 GENERAL<br><br>1.1 Description of Services: This QASP will establish oversight and surveillance for the Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) established for HVAC Systems & Controls Service per the Performance Work Statement (PWS) shown below for the DDESS schools located at Ft Bragg/Pope AFB Region of North Carolina. This plan sets forth the procedures and guidelines that the Corps of Engineers Southwest Fort Worth (SWF) will use in ensuring the required performance standards or services levels are achieved by the contractor.<br><br>1.1. Work Requiring Surveillance: The Contractors shall, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the awarded BPA IDIQ, and more particularly, in each individually placed call for work, provide all personnel, labor, plant, equipment, parts, tools, supplies, management, transportation and other items necessary to perform but not limited to provide installation, replacement,  preventative maintenance, scheduled maintenance, inspection services, emergency and repair services, schedule/demand services, state and federal required inspections to properly maintain HVAC systems and equipment and associated controls for heating, air conditioning, and ventilation that also includes the Metasys Energy Management Control System (EMCS), as well as disposal of equipment and materials. <br><br>2.0 PURPOSE<br><br>2.1 The purpose of the QASP is to describe the systematic methods used to monitor performance and to identify the required documentation and the resources to be employed.  The QASP provides a means for evaluating whether the contractor is meeting the performance standards identified in the PWS to ensure that the government pays only for the level of services received.  <br><br>2.2 This QASP defines the roles and responsibilities of all members of the integrated delivery team (IDT), identifies the performance objectives, defines the methodologies used to monitor and evaluate the contractor's performance, describes quality assurance documentation requirements, and describes the analysis of quality assurance monitoring results.<br><br>3.0 Performance Management Approach<br><br>3.1 The PWS structures the acquisition around "what" service or quality level is required, as opposed to "how" the contractor should perform the work (i.e., performance not prescriptive). This QASP will define the performance management approach taken by the COR to monitor and manage the contractor's performance to ensure the expected outcomes or performance objectives communicated in the PWS are achieved.  Performance management rests on developing a capability to review and analyze information generated through performance assessment. The ability to make decisions based on the analysis of performance data is the cornerstone of performance management; this analysis yields information that indicates whether expected outcomes for the project are being achieved by the contractor. <br><br>3.2 Performance management represents a significant shift from the more traditional quality assurance (QA) concepts in several ways. Performance management focuses on assessing whether outcomes are being achieved and to what extent. This approach migrates away from scrutiny of compliance with the processes and practices used to achieve the outcome. A performance-based approach enables the contractor to play a large role in how the work is performed, as long as the proposed processes are within the stated constraints. The only exceptions to process reviews are those required by law (federal, state, and local) and compelling business situations, such as safety and health. A "results" focus provides the contractor flexibility to continuously improve and innovate over the course of the BPA as long as the critical outcomes expected are being achieved and/or the desired performance levels are being met.<br><br>4.0 Performance Management Strategy<br><br>4.1 The contractor is responsible for the quality of all work performed. The contractor measures that quality through the contractor's own quality control (QC) program. QC is work output, not workers, and therefore includes all work performed under this BPA regardless of whether the work is performed by contractor employees or by subcontractors. The contractor will engage in performance management to assess and monitor its own performance. The contractor will perform self-inspection for quality, timeliness, responsiveness, customer satisfaction, and other performance requirements.  <br><br>4.2 The Government representative(s) will monitor performance to determine how the contractor is performing against industry norms. The contractor will be responsible for making required changes in processes and practices to ensure performance is executed and managed effectively.<br><br>5.0 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES<br><br>5.1 The Contracting Officer (KO). The Contracting Officer (KO) is responsible for monitoring compliance to the terms of the BPA and the individual orders (calls), administration, and cost control and for resolving any differences between the observations documented by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and the contractor. The KO will designate a COR as the Government authority for performance management. The number of additional representatives serving as technical inspectors depends on the complexity of the services measured, as well as the contractor's performance, and must be identified and designated by the KO.<br><br>5.2 The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR is designated in writing by the KO to act as his or her authorized representative to assist in administering the individual orders (calls) issued under this BPA. COR limitations are contained in the written appointment letter. The COR is responsible for technical administration of the project and ensures proper Government surveillance of the contractor's performance. The COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the Government's behalf. Any changes that the contractor deems may affect awarded price of an order (call), terms, or conditions shall be referred to the KO for action.  The COR will have the responsibility for evaluation of the contractor's work performance.  Government surveillance may occur under the inspection of services clause for any service relating to this BPA.<br><br>5.3 Ordering Officers. The Ordering Officer is designated in writing by the KO to act as his or her authorized representative to administer the BPA and the individual orders (calls). The ordering officer will be a designated school official that will maintain a BPA log, BPA call file, and be authorized to place orders (calls) up to the limit established by the KO in writing. The ordering officer may also confirm the satisfactory completion of work and request payment of submitted invoices for completed work. <br><br>6.0 IDENTIFICATION OF REQUIRED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, QUALITY LEVELS & PAYMENTS<br><br>The required performance standards and/or quality levels are included in the PWS (attachment 1) and "Performance Requirements Summary" (attachment 2).  If the contractor meets the required service or performance level, it will be paid the amount agreed on in the order (call).  Failure to meet the required service or performance level may result in a payment delay or deduction from the requested invoice amount.<br><br>Payment and Corrective Action:  Full payment for a BPA order (call) will be provided upon verification of overall acceptable performance by the DDESS BPA COR at the school, as rated on quality, timeliness and cost.  This verification will be recorded in a simplified performance evaluation form submitted to the KO and PM rating overall performance with a recommendation for payment. (Attachment 3)<br><br>6.1 METHODOLOGIES TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE<br><br>6.1.1 Surveillance Techniques. In an effort to minimize the performance management burden, simplified surveillance methods shall be used by the Government to evaluate contractor performance when appropriate. The primary methods of surveillance are:  (1) Random monitoring and/or (2) 100% Inspection. <br><br>Since each BPA order (call) is a Firm-Fixed-Price Contract, the Contractor's performance will be evaluated by assessing the milestones and deliverables associated with each individual order (call) according to two standards: quality and timeliness.  For each of these performance standards, the COR will assign one of three ratings to the A-E's performance: superior, acceptable, or unacceptable as shown in Attachment 2.  <br><br>6.1.2 Communications. The contractor is expected to establish and maintain professional communication between its employees and customers. The primary objective of this communication is customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is the most significant external indicator of the success and effectiveness of all services provided and can be measured through customer complaints. Performance management drives the contractor to be customer focused through initially and internally addressing customer complaints and investigating the issues and/or problems but the customer always has the option to communicate complaints to the COR or KO as opposed to the contractor. <br><br>6.1.3 Customer complaints, to be considered valid, must set forth clearly and in writing the detailed nature of the complaint, must be signed, and must be forwarded to the COR or KO. <br>Customer feedback may also be obtained either from the results of formal customer satisfaction surveys or from random customer complaints. <br><br>6.2 Acceptable Quality Levels <br><br>The acceptable quality levels (AQLs) included in Attachment 2, Performance Requirements Summary Table, for contractor performance are structured to allow the contractor to manage how the work is performed while providing processes for performance shortfalls. QUALITY <br><br>6.3 ASSURANCE DOCUMENTATION<br><br>6.3.1 Performance Management Feedback Loop. The performance management feedback loop begins with the communication of expected outcomes. Performance standards are expressed in the PWS and assessed using the performance monitoring techniques shown in Attachment 2.  <br><br>6.3.2 Monitoring Forms. The Government's surveillance will be annotated using the monitoring forms in Attachments 3. The forms, when completed, will document the Government's assessment of the contractor's performance under the individual orders (calls) to ensure that the required results are being achieved. The form will be maintained in the BPA file at the school. <br><br><br>6.4 ANALYSIS OF QUALITY ASSURANCE ASSESSMENT<br><br>6.4.1 Determining Performance. Government shall use the monitoring methods cited in paragraph 6.1.1 to determine whether the performance service levels have been met. If the contractor has not met the minimum requirements, a corrective action plan may need to be developed to show how and by what date performance is intended to be brought up to the required levels. <br><br>6.4.2 Reporting<br><br>At the completion of each individual order (call), the COR will prepare a written report for summarizing the overall results of the contractor's performance.  This written report, which may be the just the completed quality assurance monitoring form (Attachment 3), will become part of the BPA documentation file.  It will aid in the yearly required evaluation of the BPA contractor thru the CPARS. The COR must coordinate and communicate with the contractor and the KO to resolve issues and concerns regarding marginal or unacceptable performance and must should be clearly documented. <br><br>Point of contact is Tiffany Brooks at Tiffany.S.Brooks@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br /><br />In the vicinity of the Santa Ana River areas described in paragraph 2 above, the drilling contractor (Contractor) will drill and sample approximately four (4) soil borings to a depth of one-hundred (100) feet and approximately ten (10) soil borings to between thirty (30) and fifty (50) feet below the existing ground surface. Hollow-stem augers (HSA) are the preferred method of drilling. The soils consist primarily of sands, silts, and some clay with gravel and occasional boulders. Bedrock may be encountered in some of the holes, in which case drilling will be terminated. Groundwater may be encountered in some or all of the holes, and heaving/flowing sands are likely in the deeper holes. In the event that groundwater and/or heaving sands prevent the use of hollow-stem augers to reach total depth, the driller, at the direction of the Corps geologist, shall be prepared to convert from hollow-stem augering to the quote mark wet quote mark rotary drilling method through the HSA in order to advance a hole to its required depth. In addition to HSA drilling, the contractor will excavate approximately fifteen (15) test pits to a depth of twelve (12) feet with a backhoe or excavator to enable the geologist to log the test pits and collect bulk soil samples for laboratory testing.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC><strong>1. GENERAL INFORMATION:<br /></strong>For planning and information purposes, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is seeking potential sources for Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) of the Air Force AN/TMS-2 Portable Doppler Radar. AN/TMS-2s sustainment must be operationally accepted by the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA). A contractor shall provide supplies and services required to plan, manage, execute engineering, integration, logistics, and operational support tasks; including all software/hardware modifications/upgrades and merchandise purchase options for the current fielded systems.
<p><br /><strong>2. BACKGROUND: <br /></strong>AN/TMS-2 is a Portable Doppler Radar system that detects, collects, makes data available locally, and delivers weather data information to AFWA, who in turn provides PDR data and products to its customers. In particular, Operational Weather Squadrons use the PDR data and products as part of a comprehensive and ongoing environmental analysis and mission impact assessment to produce weather warnings, watches, advisories, and other mission-essential weather products that are delivered to support air and ground operators. The AN/TMS-2 system enables interoperability to provide consistent and relevant radar analysis information to joint decision makers. AN/TMS-2 will generate radar products using volume scan technology that greatly reduces man-intensive analysis and automates radar control. The AN/TMS-2 system operates at the UNCLASSIFIED security/classification level on DoD-provided common-user communications networks. <br /><br />The PDR to be sustained under CLS is the EWR-700XD, a commercial radar manufactured by EWR Weather Radar.&nbsp; The United States Air Force has approximately 20 systems at various locations worldwide which can be re-located to other locations within days.<br /><br />The sustainment effort described herein must be performed such that a common hardware and software configuration baseline is maintained. A common AN/TMS-2 hardware and software configuration baseline is critical to ensure form, fit, and function commonality to concurrently support the AN/TMS-2 mission and its interface with the Weather Product Management and Distribution System (WPMDS), at AFWA, as well as maintain commonality in operations, maintenance, and logistics among all AN/TMS-2 sites.</p>
<p><br /><strong>3. REQUESTED CAPABILITY:<br /></strong>The procurement contract is ending and sustainment will begin at the end of that contract. The radar must be maintained and spares supplied. The contractor must fully understand and show prior experience with maintaining radar systems, providing spare parts, and help desk support. This is an advance notice for potential work for which funding has not yet been approved. The contractor shall be responsible for:<br />1. Providing support to the AN/TMS-2 systems; including implementing help desk support, repairing and replacing of Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), and performing Information Assurance (IA) sustainment work which will include evaluating and disseminating Time Compliance Network Order (TCNO) updates, conducting annual scans, and updating the operating systems and application software to approved versions.<br />2. Identifying hardware obsolesce issues, determining form, fit, function replacement items, proposing them to the Government, and updating documentation after the changes are approved.<br />3. Identifying software obsolesce issues and proposing technical solutions to the government. For software changes any of the following tasks may be required but not limited to: obtaining a new IA certification, modifying/upgrading software, re-writing of technical documentation, administering training and supporting Government testing.</p>
<p><br /><strong>4. RESPONSES:<br /></strong>Please submit written responses no later than 15 days from issuance of this synopsis as e-mail attached Microsoft Word document, limited to 10 pages one sided 8.5" x 11" courier type, 10 point with 1 inch margins.

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice.  The Mission and Installation Contracting Command-Fort Bragg (MICC-FB), North Carolina intends to procure a non-personnel services contract to provide Red-cockaded Woodpecker (RCW) Cavity Tree Survey Support Services for the Endangered Species Branch, located on Fort Bragg, North Carolina.   <br>  <br> General Background:  Comprehensive surveys for new cavity trees will be conducted on Army lands that support RCWs. All pine trees inhabited by the federally endangered RCW must be located and protected from activities that may lead to harm or harassment.   Old-growth pine trees are the preferred nesting/roosting substrate for RCWs.  Old-growth pine trees, located on Fort Bragg exist as scattered individual trees on uplands and individual or small groups of pines located in low lying areas or drains.  Old-growth pines usually, but not always, have a large diameter, may have been boxed for resin production, may have one (1) or more red-heart fungus conchs on the bole, and virtually all have very large, often deformed, branches.  These pines usually, but not always, have a flat-topped appearance and are at least 150-175 years old.

This is an RFI released pursuant to FAR 15.201(e). This RFI is issued solely for information, planning purposes, and market research only; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is not at this time seeking proposals. CBP will not pay for any cost associated with responding to this RFI. All costs will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP. If a solicitation is released, it will be posted in the Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fbo.gov).

As the nation's single, unified border agency, CBP's mission is vitally important for the protection of the American people and the national economy. CBP represents the first line of defense of America's borders. One of CBP's strategic objectives is to establish and maintain effective control of air, land, and maritime borders with the appropriate mix of infrastructure, technology, and personnel. An integral component to this situational awareness is the use of mobile video surveillance systems, which provide information on the location and movement of potential Items of Interest (IoIs).</span></span></span></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="COLOR: black">CBP consistently seeks to obtain information and comments from industry that will provide the agency with insight into market conditions and/or scientific advances that will aid in the refinements of requirements and the formation of an acquisition strategy for mobile video surveillance systems. CBP plans to utilize mobile video surveillance technology to enhance agents' ability to detect and track illegal incursions and to provide CBP agents with improved situational awareness between the Ports of Entry (POE). This RFI is designed to conduct market research to determine the current level of technology and availability of such technology in the current market. CBP is interested in obtaining information related to existing, fully developed, and integrated mobile video surveillance system technology described in the following sections. CBP intends to deploy these surveillance systems as part of a tailored, layered approach to improve situational awareness along the U.S. Southwest Border. There is no intent to develop any items or systems under this program. </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Small businesses are encouraged to respond to this RFI in order to assist CBP in determining the potential level of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability of the Small Business community to fulfill this requirement. However, responses to this RFI are solicited from all interested parties.<br /><br />Solicitation:<br /><br /><span style="COLOR: #1f497d">U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Agency expects to release the Mobile Video Surveillance System (MVSS) Request for Proposals (RFP) between April 26, 2013 and May 26, 2013.&nbsp; The Government will provide an update on FBO.gov if this estimated solicitation release changes.&nbsp; </span></p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<DESC>** The following statement has been removed, in its entirety, from this RFI.** For a comprehensive list of the Department of the Navys AWICS performance requirements, refer to attachment "N98 Memorandum for AWICS Proposed Abbreviated Acquisition Program Requirements."** 

This announcement constitutes an RFI notice for planning purposes.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP).  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.
Air Combat Electronics (PMA 209), in support of the Director, Air Warfare (N98), is surveying industry for capabilities to provide an encrypted Aircraft Wireless Internal Communication System (AWICS) that can meet the requirements of air and ground crew members performing duties in the back of the aircraft, while dismounted from the aircraft, and during hoist and other normal aircraft operations.
  PMA 209 will use the RFI respondents information to formulate acquisition approaches and plan for appropriate future investments. 

AWICS was established to eliminate the entanglement hazards posed by the Internal Communications System (ICS) long cord component currently used by air and ground crew members on rotary wing, tilt rotor, and fixed wing aircraft.  Incorporation of this wireless technology will enable safer communication between air and ground crew members during all phases of ground and flight operations.  The Navys (on behalf of Naval Aviation: Navy and Marine Corps) principal requirement is to eliminate the long cord entanglement hazard.

The government encourages industry to respond to this RFI even if your system does not meet all of the current AWICS requirements, as the responses will assist the finalization of the requirements generation process.
  Therefore, there is a possibility that not all desired performance characteristics stated herein will be included in the potential AWICS solution.

These projects will support the Intelligence Community, Department of Defense customers and other Federal agencies. The contractors will be responsible for all aspects of construction and design (on DB task orders) to perform a broad range of construction services including new construction, repair, rehabilitations and/or alterations to existing buildings and also, demolition, infrastructure projects, interior fit-up, communications, security and force protection (AT/FP) projects in support of construction efforts. Projects will include SCIF construction, data centers, highly complex mechanical and electrical systems and experience in these types of work will be paramount. <br /><br />Projects may be awarded throughout the Continental United States and Hawaii with the focus of the projects in the Baltimore-Washington Corridor.</p>
<p>Currently, RSFO is looking to hold the Industry Day around early April. If you are interested in attending the Industry Day, please send an email to Melissa.A.Svetich2@usace.army.mil . Responses are required by COB 15 March 2013.</p>
<p>Once the level of interest is determined, we will post another notice with the venue details, date and time and instructions for attendance.</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to enter into any acquisition for any products or services. No solicitation document exists at this time.</p>

<p>Purchase Request Number: DHQCSD13MPT0048<br />Contract Number: HC1028-11-F-0138<br />Task/Delivery Order Number: N/A<br />Procurement Title: Defense Enterprise Computing Center - Oklahoma City (DECC OKC) Operational Support Teams (OST), Customer Support and Application Support Services Contracting Office: Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Office (DITCO)-SCOTT-PL83<br />Estimated Value: $175,449.60<br />Authority: FAR 16.505 (b)(2)(i)(C)</p>
<p>(1.) JUSTIFICATION FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY<br />Number: N/A</p>
<p>Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as the Contracting Officer, hereby approve this exception to fair opportunity pursuant to the authority of FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C).</p>
<p>1. REQUIRING AGENCY AND CONTRACTING OFFICE: Requiring Activity: <br />DISA OKC<br />8705 Industrial Blvd, Bldg 3900<br />Tinker AFB, OK 73145</p>
<p>Contracting Activity: DISA/DITCO-SCOTT-PL83<br />Building 3600<br />2300 East Drive<br />Scott AFB IL 62225-4764</p>
<p>2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION(S): The purpose of this action is to award a modification under HC1028-11-F-0138 with TechGuard Security to increase the contract level of effort in order to accommodate a surge in event support requirements. This is a firm fixed price contract. The estimated increase is $175,449.60. The surge is to cover the Enterprise Email servers being deployed in support of the Army migrations efforts. Additionally, these new positions will support the migration of the Mobility Service Desk from DISA Continental United States (CONUS) to DECC OKC, which will occur on 01 May 13. Without these additions, DoD Enterprise Email DEE will not be able to provide the additional Enterprise Email capacity for the Army and DISA CONUS will be required to renew their support contract which will be directly contrary to the mandate of DISA OPORD 12-106 (Mobility Pilot Program - SD Relocation).</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: This task order addresses the broad range of actions required for the Defense Enterprise Systems Customer Support Professional (JES-CSP). Utilizing Ticket Management System TMS Remedy System, open, close and otherwise manage all incidents reported to the<br />service desk in support of JESS supported by DISA. As well as monitoring the Joint Enterprise operating environment via monitoring tools such as System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) and Formula and coordinate Authorized Service Interruptions (ASI) between ASI coordinators and customers/DISA Command Center. Support all TIER II Service Desk functions directly related to the use of DoD Enterprise Email (JEE); specifically in support of DISA customer utilizing Microsoft Outlook Access, Outlook WEB Access and BlackBerry Administration tools. Perform coordination between customer base and TIER III on processing provisioning actions prior to account activation</p>
<p>The total estimated level of effort is $175,449.60. The period of performance for the modification to increase the contract is 1 April l3 thru 30 November 2013. A breakdown of estimated costs is as follows:</p>
<p>OY2: $175,449.60</p>
<p><br />4. SUPPORTING RATIONALE, INCLUDING A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY:</p>
<p>(a) Exception to Fair Opportunity. FAR 16,505(b)(2)(i)(C): The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.</p>
<p>(b) Description of the Justification. TechGuard is already performing these services; TechGuard provides exceptional planning and management expertise. TechGuard can deliver qualified applicants to perform the services required.</p>
<p>(c) Justification:<br />(1) Minimum Government requirements. The estimated requirements for the labor are<br />3,840 hours. An IGCE has been provided. This condensed timeline necessitates the decision to restrict competition.<br />(2) Proposed sole source contractor. TechGuard has been the incumbent for this requirement stating 1 December 2010. The contract had two option years which have been exercised. The current contract expires on 30 Nov 13.<br />(3) Discussion regarding cause of the sole source situation. This sole source situation is necessary due to time to conduct a competitive procurement and the complexity of the requirement.<br />(4) Demonstration of unique source. TechGuard is the ONLY source that can provide the labor category for a start date considering the timelines. These positions augment to the current staff assigned to the Defense Enterprise Email Service Desk.<br />(5) Procurement discussion.<br />&bull; Estimated start date: 1 April 2013.</p>
<p>(1) Impact: Failure to deploy Army Defense Enterprise Email</p>
<p>5. COST/PRICE FAIR AND REASONABLE DETERMINATION: The cost to the Government will be determined fair and reasonable prior to award.</p>
