<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 511210 with a small business size standard of $38.5M. <br /><br />AFRL/RISA requires a purchase of EXata Platform License renewal consisting of the following Government owned items: <br /><br />Part number SCA-EXA-BASE-MS-17; EXata Platform License maintenance and support; QTY 1; coverage period date of award through 19 FEB 2020
<p>Part number SCA-JNE; QTY 1;</p>
<p>Part number SCA-LTE-MS-17; LTE maintenance and support; QTY 1; coverage period date of award through 19 FEB 2020</p>
<p>Part number SCA-MRAD-MS-17; military radios Maintenance and Support; QTY 1; coverage period date of award through 19 FEB 2020</p>
<p>Part number SCA-SlthNet-MS-17; QTY 1</p>
<p>Part number SCA-PROPURBAN-MS-17; Urban Propagation maintenance and support; QTY 1; coverage period date of award through 19 FEB 2020</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with: <br />Scalable Network Technologies (SNT)<br />600 Corporate Pointe, Suite 1200<br />Culver City, CA 90230</p>
<p>The Government has determined that no other source can meet the unique EXata Platform product capabilities, software support/upgrades and bug fixes. This product simulates tactical battlefield network conditions in order to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of AFRL developed products if deployed under those conditions. This software product provides a very powerful network emulation capability and is very complex to use. Our ability to accurately predict this performance is negatively impacted without SNT's technical support, which increases technology deployment risks. The EXata Platform from SNT can meet all of these requirements. No other vendor is qualified to provide software support or upgrades or bug fixes to SNT's proprietary software. Therefore, SNT is the only source capable and available to provide these services. <br /><br />This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to richard.childres@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.<br /><br />Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 30 APR 2018.<br /><br />A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award.</p>

Introduction and Overview
An automated blood bank analyzer is needed which performs the full range of immunohematology testing, including crossmatches, cell panels, antigen testing and serial dilutions for titration studies. The analyzer must automate blood bank test processes including liquid pipetting, reagent handling, incubation, centrifugation, reaction grading and interpretation.
Scope of Work

Delivery of ORTHO VISION for the purpose of automated pre-transfusion testing of patient and donor specimens. Full range of immunohematology testing must include the following test menu:
ABO/RH Group
Antibody Screen
Antibody Identification
Antigen Typing
Cell Panels
Crossmatch (AHG)
DAT (IgG and Polyspecific)
Eluates
RH Phentotype
Serial Dilutions for Titration Studies

Performance Specifications

System must use column agglutination technology
Instrument must be capable of fully automated serial dilutions
Testing system must not utilize proprietary system liquids
Instrument must offer up to 24 hours walkaway time
When operational, the instrument must always be in a ready mode and at no time go into a hibernation or  sleep  state
Testing system must have capability for a minimum of three pre-diluted antibody identification panels FDA cleared for use in conjunction with the instrument
Instrument must be able to run selected antibody identification panels
Supplier s pre-diluted reagent red blood cells must utilize United States based donors. Reagent red blood cells and column agglutination technology cards must use United States based manufacturing
Vendor must supply an analyzer capable of bench top installation
Instrument system must have a pipette conditioning (e.g. dead) volume <20 l
Vendor must have a demonstrated ability to supply automated and non-automated FDA licensed reagents for blood bank or transfusion service testing under their own brand
Fully loaded waste containers shall each not weigh more than 11 lbs. and be accessible at waste height
Optical resolution of the on-board camera must be at least 5 megapixel resolution down to 32 x 32 microns, and store a digital image of both the front and back of each gel card to record test results
System must have capability to interface to the laboratory information system (LIS)
Performance Specifications with Detail

System must use agglutination technology

ORTHO VISION Analyzer utilizes IDMTS  Gel, a column agglutination technology

Instrument must be capable of fully automated serial dilutions

1) The ORTHO VISION Analyzer is an FDA cleared blood bank analyzer on the market that is capable of performing fully automated serial dilutions for titration studies with no manual dilution steps. Titration studies historically have been highly manual and laborious exercises prone to opportunity for error and tech to-tech variability. Fully automated serial dilutions allow for less hands-on time and less opportunity for human error. Serial dilutions are performed for disease monitoring, pregnancy, and transplant workups and ongoing evaluation.

c. Testing system must not utilize proprietary system liquids

The ORTHO VISION Analyzer uses readily available, non-proprietary, system liquids. The ORTHO VISION uses normal blood bank saline and distilled water   both of which are standard BB items 

d. Instrument must offer up to 24 hours walkaway time

The ORTHO VISION Analyzer is proven to have up to 24 hours of walkaway capability. Operator only has to interface with the system to load patient samples. The analyzer always has the capacity of reagents and waste storage on board to sustain for up to 24 hours of testing (and a minimum of 4 hours).

e. When operational, the instrument must always be in a ready mode and at no time go into hibernation or  sleep  state

The ORTHO VISION Analyzer does not need to be routinely interacted with when not in use to keep it ready for testing. It is always in a state in which testing can begin without a  warm up  period. 

f. Testing system must have capability for a minimum of three pre-diluted antibody identification panels

The ORTHO VISION Analyzer is the only column agglutination system to offer three fully pre-diluted, ready to run, and FDA cleared reagent red cells panels for automated antibody identifications; Associated ORTHO Reagent 0.8% Red Blood Cells Panels A, B and C. 

g. Instrument must be able to run selected antibody identification panels

1) The ORTHO VISION can run selected cell antibody identification panels and run a true auto control

h. Supplier s pre-diluted reagent red blood cells must utilize United States based donors. Reagent red blood cells and column agglutination technology cards must use United States based manufacturing

All ORTHO ID-MTS  Gel cards and pre-diluted Reagent Red Blood Cells are MADE IN THE USA in Raritan, NJ and Pompano Beach, FL. Additionally, all ORTHO pre-diluted reagent red blood cells are sourced from donors based in the United Stated. 

Vendor must supply an analyzer capable of bench top installation

The ORTHO VISION Analyzer is a bench top analyzer and can be used either on an existing lab bench top or with the optional instrument cart.
j. Instrument system must have a pipette conditioning (e.g. dead) volume <20 l

1) The ORTHO VISION Analyzer has < 20 l dead volume for the pipette probe. This translates into reagent savings (less dead volume = less waste).



k. Vendor must have a demonstrated ability to supply automated and non-automated FDA licensed reagents for blood bank or transfusion service testing under their own brand

1) ORTHO supplies automated and traditional reagents as a one stop shop under the Ortho Clinical Diagnostics brand name.
Fully loaded waste containers shall each not weigh more than 11 lbs. and be accessible at waste height

Minimizing the handling of heavy waste containers should always be an ergonomic and operator safety consideration. All fluid containers, as measured when they are full, on the ORTHO VISION Analyzer weigh less than 11lbs and are located at waist level to ease ergonomic concerns.

m. Optical resolution of the on-board camera must be at least 5 megapixel resolutions down to 32 x 32 microns, and store a digital image of both the front and back of each gel card to record test results

1) The digital camera for ORTHO VISION Analyzer has a Full color resolution of 5 megapixels down to 32 x 32 microns and stores all images digitally for ease of reference and operator interpretation of test results. The ORTHO VISION Analyzer also takes pictures of both sides of the ID-MTS  Gel card

This contract will replace the current contract for similar services awarded in June 2013. The total maximum value of the current contract is $800 million over the 5 year life of the contract. Information about the current contract and incumbent contractors (e.g.
 value of contracts, firms names, addresses, etc) will be included in the solicitation package. Requests under the Freedom of Information Act are not required for this information.

<DESC>NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk Philadelphia Office intends to procure, for the Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), the continued maintenance and support of the Enterprise Safety Application Management System (ESAMS) on their Navy servers. The ESAMS system is comprised of a unique suite of web-enabled applications that support and integrate safety and occupational health, traffic safety, recreational and off-duty safety, explosive safety, emergency management, fire and emergency services, anti-terrorism/force protection, security, and the chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive (CBRNE) program. HGW and Associates has developed this fully integrated and powerful web based system of applications which has been implemented throughout CNIC, NAVFAC, and other tenant commands and organizations. ESAMS utilizes a centralized database that allows personnel, supervisors, department coordinators/administrators, command administrators, regional administrators, claimant administrators, program administrators and commands providing base operational support (BOS) administrators, a system to track information that supports compliance for their OSHA, NFPA, National Fire Administration (NFA), DoD, Navy requirements: i.e., training, metrics, inspections, respirator fit tests, and occupational medical surveillance, equipment tracking, voluntary protection program compliance (VPP), personnel requirements, etc.
This is a sole source action to be awarded to HGW and Associates LLC. HGW is the only firm who can supply the required services for the acquisition. The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.
THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract will be issued as a result. Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based on the responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this notice. Any responses to this synopsis should be sent to the attention Laura Mattiford at laura.mattiford@navy.mil and reference this notice. The applicable NAICS and size standard are 541511 and $27.5M respectively.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.101(a)(1) requiring the dissemination of information regarding proposed contract actions. This Notice of Intent is for a proposed award of a sole source, firm-fixed price contract, as implemented by FAR 13.106-1   soliciting from a single source. It is not a request for competitive quotes.
The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 23 intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price contract to Cepheid for proprietary maintenance and repair support services for Cepheid GeneXpert Infinity Analyzer. VA requires the proprietary maintenance and repair services from Cepheid, as implemented by FAR 13.106-1- soliciting from a single source, because the software and services are unique or proprietary to Cepheid. Market research revealed that Cepheid is the proprietary developer and distributor for the equipment currently being utilized by VA. Additionally, Cepheid is the only manufacturer that can provide the required maintenance support for the equipment. The software system is routinely used by VA to provide medical services for veterans in the VA Healthcare System. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 811219 and the service code is J066. 
While this synopsis does not constitute a solicitation, interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the requirement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The Government understands that Cepheid is the only vendor that can provide the requested services. However, vendors that believe they can provide the capabilities required to fully meet the Government's requirement may submit information in writing to curt.larose@va.gov by 14 March 2018. Such documentation will be reviewed solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct the procurement on a competitive basis. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This notice serves as a pre-solicitation notice/procurement synopsis. United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Raytheon Company Missile Systems (hereinafter referred to as Raytheon), 1151 E Hermans Rd., Tucson, AZ 85756-9367 for the procurement of additional Griffin missiles and related engineering support as required over no more than five ordering periods covering calendar years (CY) 18 through 22. <br /><br />In Aug 2017, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Rapid Acquisition Cell, Eglin AFB in support of USSOCOM awarded an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to Raytheon for the procurement of Griffin missiles (multiple variants), equipment, and engineering and logistics system support. The IDIQ enables AFLCMC to order (on USSOCOM's behalf) up to 800 missiles per CY through the end of CY 21. Following award of the IDIQ contract, the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) provided guidance to the DoD to maximize munitions production, which is not within the scope of the AFLCMC IDIQ contract. Therefore, USSOCOM has a need for a "delta" IDIQ contract to procure the additional Griffin missiles necessary to maximize munitions production in accordance with the SECDEF's guidance.<br /><br />A determination not to compete this anticipated contract is being considered pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This determination is based on the fact that there are no known missiles other than the Griffin missile that meet the Powered Standoff Precision Guided Munition (SOPGM) requirements (attached to this notice as "SOPGM Requirements_Powered"). Further, Raytheon is the designer, developer, and sole qualified producer of the Griffin missile.<br /><br />USSOCOM contemplates award of an IDIQ contract with no more than five ordering periods covering CY 18 through CY 22. The anticipated contract award date is Jul 2018. USSOCOM anticipates procuring approximately 640 additional Griffin missiles per CY through CY 21 and potentially 1,440 Griffin missiles in CY 22 but actual missile quantities will be determined on a delivery order basis.<br /><br />The intent of this notice is for informational purposes only. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by USSOCOM. Please note that this notice is not a formal solicitation or request for competitive proposals and no award will be made on the basis of quotations or proposals received in response to this notice.

Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this notice will NOT be reimbursed. All information marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-Government personnel and entities. <br /><br />If you desire to respond to this notice, please do so no later than 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on Monday, 19 Mar 2018. All responses shall be sent via e-mail to:<br /><a href="mailto:michael.hawkins4@socom.mil">michael.hawkins4@socom.mil</a> and should include the following: company's full name, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, a detailed capabilities statement asserting their capabilities in providing the products described herein, a point of contact with phone and e-mail information, business status (Socio-Economic Factors: 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business, etc.), and business size based on North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 336414, Guided Missile and Space Vehicle Manufacturing.

This statement of capabilities shall include a description of facilities, equipment, personnel and other capabilities to produce these items within the United States. Technical Data for these items can only be made to US Companies that are certified through the Joint Certification Program (JCP). Prior to receiving the technical data companies are required to provide the capability statement to ascertain their capabilities to produce these items. Companies that are lacking cannon manufacturing capabilities will not be granted access to this critical technical data even if those companies are JCP certified due to the critical nature of the technical data. Additionally, any recipient of technical data for the cannon assemblies will be required to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements prior to receiving the technical data. Upon receipt of the technical data, the Government request information on production lead time, manufacturing rates and ROM cost estimates.<br />Submissions that are not fully compliant with all requirements are also encouraged so that JPMO-TAS and RDECOM-ARDEC may assess the capabilities of all currently available sources. The Government recognizes that proprietary and/or classified data may be a part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted/proprietary and classified data and present them as an addendum to the nonrestricted/non-proprietary and unclassified information. As a result of this Sources Sought a Request For Proposal (RFP) may be issued to acquire the supplies. Participation in this Sources Sought is completely voluntary by the vendor and as such all costs to develop the vendor's response are to be borne by the participating vendor. All interested sources are encouraged to submit their abilities/capabilities no later than 5 days from date of this publication to: Klaudia A.

<DESC><strong>This IS NOT a request for bids, quotes, or proposal. This is a sources sought announcement only.</strong> The purpose of this notice is to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>conduct market research</strong></span> and obtain information from qualified sources.&nbsp; <strong>No award may be issued from this Request for Information Notice.</strong>
<p><strong><br />Interested parties of any size may submit a response to this notice.</strong></p>
<p>The BEP seeks sources that can provide upper and lower electrodes for a Plastic Weld Machine (PWM). The PWM, manufactured by KBA NotaSys, SA, is 35 year old technology that is no longer used in the Intaglio Plate Making process. The PWM was purchased over 10 years ago and has since been replaced as an industry practice by the Computer to Intaglio Plate (CTiP) process. The Bureau is still required to use the PWM due to our legacy notes that were made using this process and&nbsp;are still currently being produced. Five of our current production denominations were manufactured using this outdated technology. There continues to be a need to replace parts for this equipment in order for the Office of Engraving to maintain quality and make much needed repairs to the PWM. BEP can expect to need this technology for the next 10 years or more&nbsp;until all denominations can be converted to CTiP or until the Catalysts family is released. <br /><br />The PWM is very sensitive and requires exact parts. Due to the sensitivity of the aged PWM, the BEP does not seek vendors to replicate the electrodes, but vendors who have parts for the PWM. Introducing parts that are not made for the PWM risk creating arc which may cause catastrophic damage to this equipment and destroy the product causing the office to lose months of production. Therefore, vendors must have the capability to provide the exact replacement parts. No drawings exist for the electrodes.<br /><br /><strong>Vendors are requested to provide the following:</strong><br /><br />Technical capabilities describing working with the PWM and the ability to provide replacement parts. <br /><br />Company name, address, phone number, primary contact(s), email address, ALL applicable NAICS code(s), business size (i.e., small/large), company's socioeconomics (i.e., woman-owned, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, HUBZone, 8(a), etc.) and DUNS Number.</p>
<p>Responses shall be emailed to gladys.wilks@bep.gov. Telephone responses will NOT be accepted. <strong>Responses must be received no later than 14 March 2018, 9:00a.m. (EST).</strong></p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any interested party responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed. Interested parties are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback with respect to any information submitted.&nbsp; No Proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation.</p>

<p>The Office of Clinical Research Training and Medical Education (OCRTME) develops, administers, and evaluates a comprehensive portfolio of clinical research training and medical education initiatives. The OCRTME centralizes many of the existing research training and medical education functions and emphasizes the NIH commitment to developing a cadre of well-trained and highly skilled medical researchers and clinician-scientists. The portfolio includes educational training courses that engages both domestic and international participants.</p>
<p>The OCRTME Long Distance On-Line Education System contains three web-based courses and a tracking mechanism for a certificate program.</p>
<p>Introduction to the Principles and Practice of Clinical Research (IPPCR) http://www.cc.nih.gov/training/training/ippcr.html The Introduction to the Principles and Practice of Clinical Research (IPPCR) consists of a curriculum on how to effectively conduct clinical research. Most medical schools lack a formal course in training for clinical research, and investigators have relied on mentors to learn how to conduct clinical trials. IPPCR usually runs from mid-October through mid-March. There is no charge for taking the course but a textbook is recommended.</p>
<p>CRT Clinical Research Training (Online) http://www.cc.nih.gov/training/training/crt.html The web-based Clinical Research Training On-Line Course for Principal Investigators addresses one of the essential standards (training and education) approved by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for performing clinical research in the Intramural Research Program. CRT may be taken at any time and completing it requires about 4 hours. There is no charge for taking the course and there is no required textbook.</p>
<p>Principles of Clinical Pharmacology (PCP) https://cc.nih.gov/training/training/principles1.html<br />The course provides an in depth review of pharmacokinetics, drug metabolism and transport, pharmacogenetics, assessment of drug effects, drug therapy in special populations, and drug discovery and development, and FDA drug regulation. The course is offered annually held from September through April (8 months). There is no charge for taking the course but a textbook is recommended. This course addresses an important professional development need for translational and clinical researchers given that most medical schools lack a formal curriculum in clinical pharmacology.</p>
<p>Clinical Research Curriculum Certificate (CRCC)<br />The Clinical Research Curriculum Certificate (CRCC) program was developed for individuals currently engaged or planning to become engaged in, clinical or translational research and wishing to acquire in-depth knowledge of clinical trial design, ethical concerns and human subject protection requirements, regulatory aspects of clinical research and the investigational new drug application (IND) process, and responsibilities of the clinical investigator.</p>
<p>These courses and certificate program accept applications on both a rolling basis and a defined application cycle. The estimated number of annual applications is 8500. Capabilities include, but are not limited to, the ability for applicants to register for courses, access course materials, complete final exams, and engage with course coordinators and faculty. The web-based applications provide program administrators the ability to search, sort and edit applications and run reports to analyze all data associated with each course and the certificate program.</p>

This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.

An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<strong><br /> <br /> </strong></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.&nbsp; It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.&nbsp; Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.&nbsp; No award will be made as a result of this notice.&nbsp; The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.&nbsp; This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.<strong><br /> <br /> </strong><strong>Background</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the Integrative Neurobiology Section of the Molecular Targets and Medication Discovery Branch,&nbsp;a Branch&nbsp;within the the National Institute on Drug Abuse Intramural Research Branch (NIDA-IRP), deals with the discovery of G-protein coupled receptor heteromers that are targets for addictive drugs or that are localized in brain circuits that are involved in substance use disorders. The analysis of their biochemical and pharmacological properties involves studies at the cellular level as well as at the in vivo level. The techniques used to dissect the properties of these receptor heteromers include the use of antibodies labeled with fluorescent molecules, which are used to establish their distribution within the nervous system. Additional fluorescence -labeled antibodies are used to establish the activation of intracellular signaling pathways upon stimulation of the elements of the receptors complexes. The evidence of the existence of a functional receptor complex both in cultured cells and in vivo is obtained by analyzing the response of the signaling pathways in the presence of pharmacological compounds with high selectivity for specific elements of the receptor complex. This response is measured accurately with instruments such as a laser scanner. Furthermore, the anatomic localization of the receptor complexes can be determined if a tissue is processed in such a way that multiple images can be acquired with a laser scanner and superimposed with analytical software.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <br /> Purpose and Objectives:&nbsp;</strong>The purpose of this acquisition is to provide NIDA-IRP&rsquo;s Molecular Targets and Medications Discovery Branch a Branch with one (1) laser scanner for fluorescence that meets all of the salient characteristics discussed below. The scanner should be capable of producing images with a spatial resolution compatible with the size of the biological sample under analysis. NIDA IRP intends to acquire images of rodent brain slices labeled with several fluorescent molecules. A single sample may have one or more fluorescent labels simultaneously. NIDA IRP also needs to acquire images of labeled proteins that are bound to membranes by the Western Blot technique as well as images of gels used for DNA and RNA analysis. Furthermore, NIDA IRP intends to analyze cell cultures also labeled with fluorescent molecules and capture images of phosphor-storage screens exposed to samples labeled with radioactive tracers. The equipment needed must have five laser configuration options for excitation of different fluorescent molecules, dichroic beam-splitter filters, photomultiplier tube detection and variable resolution ranging from 10 microns to 200 microns to cover all the imaging modes used in the laboratory.</span></p>

<DESC><p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>Background: </strong></p>
<p>The NCATS Screening facilities are state of the art laboratories whose goals are:</p>
<p>&bull; Collaborate with NIH investigators to perform genome-wide RNAi screening projects (assay development, screening and validation) to understand fundamental biology and accelerate target discovery.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop methods that advance the science of RNAi screening and informatics (e.g., by addressing the high incidence of false-positives in RNAi-based target discovery).</p>
<p>&bull; Perform education and outreach to increase awareness of the RNAi program's tools and methods.</p>
<p>&bull; Pursue new technologies for exploring gene function.</p>
<p>The facilities' current robotic system features key elements for an automated screen (reagent dispenser, incubators, pintool, and robotic arms), but lacks a plate reader.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>This acquisition is for a multimodal plate reader that offers the most advanced features that are compatible to NCATS current robotic system. Once integrated onto RNAi's robotic system, the plate reader will be able to read plates using many assay technologies including fluorescence intensity (FI), fluorescence polarization (FP), alpha screen, luminescence, absorbance and time resolved fluorescence (TRF), and can be configured with injectors which can inject and read at the point of measurement.</p>
<p>NCATS previously acquired three PHERAstar plate readers for offline laboratory use, and having additional readers integrated onto automated robotic platforms are necessary to provide continuity for scientific experiments that have been validated on an offline instrument. The addition of automated plate readers will make it possible for assays to be run in a fully automated fashion, which is critical towards NCATS achieving its scientific mission.</p>
<p><strong>Project requirements: </strong></p>
<p>NCATS seeks to purchase three BMG PHERAstar FSX multimodal plate readers, or brand equal, for integration on a variety of fully automated robotic platforms. The robotic systems currently feature key elements for an automated screen (reagent dispenser, incubators, pintool, and robotic arms), but lack plate readers.</p>
<p>The PHERAstar FSX multimodal plate readers are commercially available items that are customized with options to fit the specific laboratory needs. Brand name or equal multimodal plate readers must have the capabilities detailed below:</p>
<p>&bull; UV/Vis Absorbance Spectra<br />&bull; Fluorescence Intensity, including Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer<br />&bull; Fluorescence Polarization/Anisotropy<br />&bull; Time Resolved Fluorescence, including Time resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer<br />&bull; Luminescence (flash and glow), including Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer<br />&bull; High energy xenon flash lamp<br />&bull; Laser for TRF / TRFRET<br />&bull; Simultaneous Dual Emission (SDE) detection for microplates<br />&bull; SDE detection that can be used in any assay including FP, FRET<br />&bull; Allow for fast TRFRET measurements<br />&bull; Combination of laser excitation and Simulataneous Dual Emission detection<br />&bull; In single flash mode, must be able to read a 1536-well plate<br />&bull; Must capture a full UV/VIS absorbance spectrum (2201000nm)<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span><br />&bull; Maximum footprint 45cm W X 51cm D x 47cm H<br />&bull; 50 kg or less in weight<br />&bull; Easy Integration into the Kalypsys Robotic Platform</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated period of performance:</strong></p>
<p>Delivery is to be 4-6 weeks after receipt of award.</p>
<p><strong>Other Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<p>These units are replacements for obsolete outdated equipment. New equipment must not invalidate current results and protocols generated by the use of our current PHERAstar equipment. Best value can also be shown by demonstrating that the successful plate reader can utilize existing PHERAstar-compatible parts, consumables and accessories, so as to maximize the support already in place. Our staff is thoroughly familiar with PHERAstar's software and of its operation; brand-equal products should minimize the training required. Advantages of alternative plate readers must outweigh the cost and delay of incorporating them into existing systems.</p>
<p><strong>Capability statement /information sought.</strong></p>
<p>Responses to this notice must include sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities of providing the product or service. The response shall include: the unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, delivery days after contract award, delivery terms, prompt payment discount terms, F.O.B.

<p>(c)	This solicitation is issued for the purpose of: Information.</p>
<p>(end of clause)</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  This is a Request for Information (RFI); a market research tool used by the Government to gauge the marketplace and learn the industry's capabilities.  Responses from all qualified businesses will assist in that determination. The information requested hereunder is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued or contract awarded. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of information. Responses to the notice will not be returned.  The Government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with Government regulations.</p>
<p>The Western Acquisition Division (WAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Seattle, WA, on behalf of the National Marine Fisheries Service's (NMFS) Alaska Fisheries Science Center's (AFSC),  Midwater Assessment and Conservation Engineering (MACE) Program.</p>
<p>This request is issued for the purpose of exchanging information to improve the Government's understanding of industry capabilities. The RFI will enable potential offerors to determine whether, or how, they could satisfy the Government's requirements to provide supplies and services at reasonable price.</p>
<p>For purposes of determine Small Business size standard, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement 336612.</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND<br />The National Marine Fisheries Service's (NMFS) Alaska Fisheries Science Center's (AFSC),  Midwater Assessment and Conservation Engineering (MACE) Program conducts regular, acoustic-trawl surveys to estimate the size of important commercial fish stocks in Alaskan waters.  Data from these surveys are used to manage fisheries resources and to provide harvest guidance. Specifically, these surveys provide information on abundance, distribution, demographic composition, and spawning status of walleye pollock and other important fish species in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea.  The primary survey vessel used by MACE is the 209 ft stern trawler NOAA Ship Oscar Dyson, a diesel electric vessel with two 1,542-hp in-line motors, 2 large capacity net reels, a third wire system, and auto-trawl equipped main winches with 1 1/8" trawl warps.</p>
<p>The acoustic-trawl surveys require a midwater trawl to identify the species and size composition of acoustically observed fish aggregations. Presently, an Aleutian Wing 30/26 Trawl (AWT) is used on all current acoustic-trawl surveys.  Recent research has shown that small fishes (8-15 cm fork length) are poorly retained by the AWT and when encountered together with larger fishes, which leads to errors in survey abundance estimates, and hence impacts management of the resource.  In addition, the large size of the AWT trawl opening presents challenges when samples are needed from dense fish aggregations, as the catches quickly become overly large for survey purposes.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this Request for Information is to identify vendors that are capable of designing a replacement midwater trawl with improved performance in comparison with the current AWT. Specifically, the updated trawl design requires: 1) improved retention of small fish, 2) reduced catch amounts per unit effort in high fish density conditions compared to the AWT, and 3) ability to withstand occasional ground contact in areas with a smooth seafloor.  In addition, improved durability, ease of operation and maintenance relative to the AWT are of high importance.</p>
<p>General operating parameters for trawling operations are listed below; approximately 150 midwater tows are conducted per year, typically for durations of 20 minutes at fishing depth (range 5 - 60 min), with fishing depth ranging from 50-700 m and a towing speed is 2.5-3.5knots.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />RFI Response Instructions</p>
<p>Interested contractors should include the following information in their response:</p>
<p>1.	Capability statement (core competencies and other relevant information).</p>
<p>2.	Company size status (small business concern per 13 CFR, educational institution, federal, local or state entity, commercial entity, nonprofit organization, etc.).</p>
<p>3.	Your Socioeconomic status, if any.</p>
<p>4.	Your status as a manufacturer or reseller of the items noted.</p>
<p>5.	Your firm's DUNs and Cage Code.</p>
<p>6.	Relevant past performance. Relevant past performance is performance under contracts or efforts within 3 years that is of the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity to that which is described in this Request for Information. Include a list of current or previous contracts performed (both Federal and commercial) within the past 3 years that are of a similar nature to this request.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI are due no later than Saturday, March 24, 2018 by 5:00 pm Pacific Time.  Responses shall be sent via email to Paul Park, Contracting Officer, paul.park@noaa.gov of your response must be in ".pdf format" and readable by the Adobe Acrobat Reader. Questions pertaining to this notice may also be emailed to Paul Park.</p>

The DoD responded by issuing DoD Directive (DoDD) 6025.21E, 5 July 2006, &ldquo;Medical Research for Prevention, Mitigation, and Treatment of Blast Injuries,&rdquo; that designated the Secretary of the Amy (SECARMY) as the DoD EA. Through a series of delegations, the SECARMY delegated EA authority to the Commander, U.S. Army Medical Command (CDR, USAMEDCOM). In 2017, the EA authority was further delegated to the Commander, U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC). The Blast Injury Research PCO was established in 2007 at the USAMRMC, Fort Detrick Maryland, under a charter signed by the CDR, USAMEDCOM. The PCO&rsquo;s mission is to support the EA by performing the medical blast injury research coordinating activities directed in the DoDD. The USAMRMC provides direct management and sustainment of the PCO; however, as a DoD EA support office, the PCO has DoD mission responsibilities.</span></a></p>

(8) Ensure that service providers and contractors who have negotiated agreements with VA that involve VA sensitive information, but do not maintain systems that require C&A, complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) within 30 days of contract approval and annually on the due date of the contract renewal. The ISO/COTR or CO can also request that a CSCA be completed by the contractor anytime there are potential security issues identified or suspected by VA or to ensure that applicable security controls are being implemented. The completion of the CSCA by the contractor is the responsibility of the COTR.
The CSCA template is maintained on the IPRM portal under the C&A Section. The COTR can contact the ISO to obtain a copy of the CSCA from the portal or to seek assistance in the completion of the assessment. The completed CSCA must be provided and reviewed by the ISO and by the CPO to ensure that adequate security is being addressed by contractors in situations where the C&A of a system is not applicable. A copy of the CSCA is uploaded by the
ISO and maintained in the document section of the SMART database.

<DESC>** Notice ONLY **&nbsp;<br /><br />No contract will be awarded from this announcement.&nbsp; This is NOT a Request for Proposal or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.&nbsp;All portions of this announcement are merely for&nbsp;notification purposes ONLY.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Department of the Navy has resourced pre-program Science and Technology activities to replace the proven Family of Light Armored Vehicles (LAV) with the Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle (ARV). <br /><br />The ARV will be a modern, purpose built, combat vehicle capable of fighting for information and shaping the battlespace, coordinating and winning the counter-reconnaissance fight, and conducting reconnaissance and security in support of the main body of a Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF).<br /><br />Core capabilities for the ARV include robust land and shore-to-shore water mobility, transportability similar to the current LAV, full spectrum protection, and capacity for future capability growth. Enabling capabilities lead to improved system and formation lethality, more capable sensors, and a greater capacity to communicate. <br /><br />The Light Armored Reconnaissance (LAR) battalion will operate in increasingly complex and highly contested environments; the ARV must enable these operations and counter threats possessing greater reach and lethality. ARV equipped LAR Battalions will exploit marked improvements in the ability to sense, shoot, communicate, and conduct maneuver while remaining afloat ready and expeditionary. ARV is the materiel means to develop next generation armored reconnaissance capability.

<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<p>The National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB) intends to negotiate a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Iron Mountain Information Management, LLC, One Federal St Boston, MA, 02110-2012, of for office renovations. Iron Mountain management is the owner of the facility and this action is a firm fixed price, single award, open market, purchase order. The General Service Administration (GSA) has delegated this requirement to NBIB to complete and does not impact the terms and conditions of the established lease. Public Buildings Service (PBS) Leasing Desk Guide, Chapter 8, Alterations in Leased Space, Section 3 page 8- 10 states the following additional best practices apply to post occupancy alterations. GSA must always first approach the lessor to request a proposal for alterations, since alterations usually require tying into the building's existing electrical, mechanical, plumbing, or fire protection systems. Using alternative sources for alterations could negate the lessor's responsibility for maintaining these systems, especially in instances of negligence or damage on the part of the Government or the Government's contractor.</p>
<p>This action will utilize the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) as outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13. NBIB occupies leased space within in the Iron Mountain facility. The Justification and Approval for this action will be included as a part of the award notice. The NAICS Code is 531120 and the Size Standard is $38,500,000.00.</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation notice serves as notice of intent to award a sole source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals and is not a solicitation or a request for offers. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that a prospective offeror can fulfill the requirements of the solicitation, that competition would be advantageous to the Government and would not violate the occupancy lease. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties should submit a capability statement to the Contracting Officer within 3 calendar days of the date of this notice. Contractors must be actively registered in SAM (https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/) database to be eligible for award.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>Notice of intent to award a Purchase Order with Sysco in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 13.106-(1)(b)(1)(i), Contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). The 133rd Minnesota Air National Guard (MNANG) was administratively unable to issue a Task Order on contract W912LM-17-D-0002 (SYSCO WESTERN MINNESOTA, INC) to purchase bulk food to feed airmen in the unit during drill weekends. A Purchase Order is being issued to fulfill the intent of Contract W912LM-17-D-0002.</p>
<p>Sysco is the incumbent food provider for the 133rd, and option years exist on Contract W912LM-17-D-0002 through June 2022. The company is established on base, understands the process, has a system in place for ordering, and makes administrative sense.</p>
<p>It is our intent to award a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Contract for $36,000.00.</p>

<p>Federal Tax ID Number _____________________________________________<br />FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations.<br />(a) Any response to this synopsis/solicitation will be considered a "quotation". <br />"Offer" means a response to a solicitation that, if accepted, would bind the offeror to perform the resultant contract. Responses to invitations for bids (sealed bidding) are offers called "bids" or "sealed bids"; responses to requests for proposals (negotiation) are offers called "proposals"; however, responses to requests for quotations (simplified acquisition) are "quotations," not offers.<br />Quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />(b) When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing, as defined at 2.101. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />(c) If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. (See 13.302-4 for procedures on termination or cancellation of purchase orders.)<br />The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:</p>
<p>Note: The full text of a clause/provision may be accessed electronically at: http://farsite.hill.af.mil. Notice: Contractor performance may be evaluated in accordance with policy at FAR 42.1502.</p>
<p>Note: Contractor will be required to utilize Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) for electronic submission of payment requests (https://wawf.eb.mil/)</p>
<p>2. Information required by Provision for Evaluation above and references;</p>
<p>Quotes must also include completed representations and certifications in the provision 52.212-3 Alt. I. If the offeror has completed 52.212-3 Alt I in SAM.gov, include the appropriate certification for NAICS and size standard in this solicitation.</p>

<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>

<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR<br />4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor<br />prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final<br />determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which<br />shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day<br />of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure<br />to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested<br />parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the<br />date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act<br />and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are<br />included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage<br />determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the U.S.<br />Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the<br />contractor.</p>
<p>6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy<br />of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See<br />29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties<br />requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage<br />determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1)).</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<br />(End of Clause)<br />52.212-5 -- Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items.<br />As prescribed in 12.301(b)(4), insert the following clause:<br />Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items (Jan 2017)<br />(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:<br />(1) 52.203-19, Prohibition on Requiring Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements or Statements (Jan 2017) (section 743 of Division E, Title VII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act 2015 (Pub.

Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs:  

This Full-Service Maintenance contract is to support the PVAMC s current inventory of Stryker Neptune II Rovers and Dockers.  The equipment provides surgical waste collection and is classified as an HTME item.  This contract will provide Full-Service Maintenance for this HTME for a Period of Performance (POP) Base Period + 4 Option Periods beginning on 3/1/2018 - 2/30/2023.

 ( x )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
        Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
 (  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
 (  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability

 (  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
 (  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
 (  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
 (  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;


The authority for applying the Simplified Procedures for Commercial Items exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) of FAR 13.5 is 41 U.S.C. 1901 (a)(2) and is implemented by restricting competition on this procurement via FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) only one source available. 

Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

The Stryker Neptune line of surgical waste collection medical equipment is classified as a High Tech Medical Equipment (HTME) and, as such, is technologically complex.  Given the nature of the equipment and the need for reliability in providing patient care in a surgical procedure environment it is necessary to utilize only OEM certified technicians to test, calibrate, maintain and repair this line of HTME.  The PVAMC office of Biomedical Engineering has determined that these services can only be rendered by the OEM Stryker Corporation.  In addition Stryker Corporation has submitted documentation stating that Stryker does not provide any certifications to third-party technicians.  In addition, OEM replacement parts required as part of this maintenance agreement are not made available to non-certified third party technicians and Stryker will not provide any certification that the systems operational integrity has been maintained when Non-OEM replacement parts are utilized in Stryker equipment. 

The Authority permitting Other than Full and Open Competition is 41 USC 3304(a), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  This authority allows for sole source procurement when it is determined that there is only one source available.  In this procurement, the only source that is OEM Certified to provide the Full-Service Maintenance contract is the Manufacturer Stryker Corporation.  Stryker has the proprietary, highly technical, information to provide the Certified Technicians and can provide all OEM Certified replacement parts required to keep the inventory of Stryker Neptune systems currently in operation at PVAMC operational.  

This procurement is in accordance with FAR 13.106(b) which grants the authority to sole source procurements that exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold when it is determined that there is only one source available.  In this procurement, the only source that is OEM Certified to provide the Full-Service Maintenance contract is the Original Equipment Manufacturer, Stryker Corporation.  Stryker has the proprietary, highly technical, information to provide the Certified Technicians and can provide all OEM Certified replacement parts required to keep the inventory of Stryker Neptune systems currently in operation at PVAMC.  

Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

This action is exempt from solicitation as outlined in FAR 6.302-1 (b)(2) due to patent rights and control of basic raw materials and secret processes.  Stryker Corporation has provided a proprietary letter stating that only their Certified Technicians can work on the HTME and only their technicians have access to OEM replacement parts.  

FAR6.302-1 (b)(2)  The existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, or secret processes; the control of basic raw material; or similar circumstances, make the supplies and services available from only one source. 

In addition, due to the proprietary letter received from Stryker Corporation and information received from the VA Chief of Biomedical engineering the exemption found in FAR 6.302-1 (b)(4) also applies to this proposed action.   

FAR 6.302-1 (b)(4)  When the agency head has determined in accordance with the agency s standardization program that only specified makes and models of technical equipment and parts will satisfy the agency s needs for additional units or replacement items, and only one source is available 


Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

The contracting officer anticipates price will be considered fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 13.106 1(b) and based on FAR 13.106 3(a)(2), using market research and comparison to the proposed prices listed in the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE). The price will be determined to be fair and reasonable prior to award and documented in accordance with FAR requirements.


Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

Market research was conducted to satisfy the requirements of the FAR 10.002(a) and is in the included in the briefcase for this requested action.  As part of the market research the Vendor Information Page (VIP) database looking for SDVOSBs/VOSBs capable of providing the requested service.  Due to the proprietary nature of the service being purchased there was no reasonable expectation that any capable contractors under VHAPM Part 810.001 Veterans First Contracting Program would be available.  The results of the VIP Database queries are recorded in the briefcase as required by VAAR 810.002.  

As described in Section 6 above, this procurement is exempt from synopsis under FAR 6.302-1 because the services are confirmed to be only available from Stryker Corporation. Through the market research process, it was determined that the services required can only be supplied by Stryker Corporation.  As such Stryker is the Sole Source provider for this service contract.  This is due to the proprietary nature of both the Certified Technicians and Stryker Corporation being the Sole Source supplier of required OEM replacement parts.

The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be competed.

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  N/A

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  N/A


A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  

In an effort to encourage competition in the future, the VA will review the requirements periodically to ensure that all the requirements of the contract reflect the minimum requirements to perform the services covered in this contract.

FAR PART 8.405-6 
 
Acquisition Plan Action ID:    VA260-18-AP-2170

The proposed sole source action is a task order against Intuitive Surgical Inc. award contract VA119-14-D-0001.

Order against:     FSS Contract Number:  VA119-14-D-0001
Name of Proposed Contractor:
Intuitive Surgical Inc.
Street Address:
1266 Kifer Road
City, State, Zip:
Sunnyvale, CA  
Phone:
408-523-8661
Description of Supplies or Services:
The estimated value of the proposed action is $ 171,661.29
The contract will furnish all necessary services, including parts and labor, to maintain the da Vinci Robotic Surgical System for optimum performance. This includes but is not limited to software maintenance, diagnostics, troubleshooting, preventative maintenance, testing, adjustments, calibrations, replacement of defective parts, and repair of parts.  The total estimated value of the proposed action is $171,661.29 with a period of performance 03/15/2018-03/09/2019.


Authority:

ORDER AGAINST FSS:  Authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program, Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 USC 251, et seq.); Title 40 USC 501, Services for Executive Agencies; and Section 803 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2002 (PL 107-107) and implemented by FAR 8.405-6:

 Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized; FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B)) Due to the highly complex nature of the Davinci dual monitor surgical system it is not possible to have this full-service maintenance contract performed by anyone other than the equipment manufacturer and OEM certified technicians.
 In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. 

 Items peculiar to one manufacturer: 

 A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii.  The Davinci Surgical System is a piece High Technical Medical Equipment (HTME) that is patented by the manufacturer and is therefore the maintenance and repair of the system is proprietary and can only be provided by the manufacturer.

   direct replacements  parts/components for the Davinci Surgical System are only available from the manufacturer through OEM certified technicians.  

 The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Only OEM certified technicians with exclusive access to OEM replacement parts can ensure the Davinci Surgical System is maintained to OEM performance standards and specifications.

Rational/explanation to support cited authority:  

Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) negotiates contracts at the National Acquisition Center (NAC) for use by all Network Contracting Offices (NCO) within the Veterans Administration.  The pricing under these contracts were already considered to be fair and reasonable.  IAW 8.405-4, pricing offered under these NAC contracts is established at a price reduction from standard market rates.  






MARKET RESEARCH: 
 
This determination satisfies the requirements of FAR 8.405-6.  The requirement to prepare a written justification IAW FAR 6.303 does not apply to Federal Supply Schedules.
Market research was note conducted at this time, as this service should be sole sourced to the OEM because the proprietary DaVinci system can only be accessed for maintenance and support by the OEM Intuitive Surgical.

REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION: 

I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.

Date:9 March  2018

From: Veterans Health Care System of Ozarks (VHSO)

Solicitation Number: 36C25618R0242

Notice Type: Notice of intent to sole source

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Healthcare System Ozarks (Fayetteville, AR) has a requirement/need for nursing home services in Monett, Missouri (Barry County). This requirement was previously awarded to a local vendor in Monett, MO. The Government intends to issue a firm-fixed-price contract, on a sole source basis to Monett health Care, LLC in Monett, MO.

Nursing home facilities in the Community Nursing Home (CNH) program shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well-being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  All nursing home facilities in VA s CNH program must have current Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) certification (Medicare and/or Medicaid) and a State nursing home license.  VA developed quality of care standards utilizing CMS inspection criteria that are followed by VA in its selection of nursing homes.  See VHA Handbook 1143.2,  VHA Community Nursing Home Oversight Procedures (June 4, 2004) a copy of which is available at:  http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/publications.cfm?pub=2 . VA often has a particular need for specialty care services in the CNH program. The VA requires CNHs to have bed capacity to ensure their ability to take referrals when requested.  The CNH also must be able to accept VA referrals in a timely fashion (ideally within 24 hours of request). Provider visits will be available at the rate of one (1) visit per month. Laboratory, x-ray, and other special services will be available to VA patients as needed.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, primary medical care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA-authorized level of care, without extra charge.  Duly authorized representatives of VA will provide quality oversight visits to veterans placed to assure continuity of care and to assist in the veterans  transition back into the community.  These visits do not substitute nor relieve the CNH in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.  The per diem rate(s) established in this IDC will include the cost of primary medical care, one (1) provider visit per month and needed consultation, drugs and routine supplies, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted (see Schedule of Items in this IDC for details regarding per diem rates and coverage).  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, interested parties may submit a capability statement that includes technical specifications of services, demonstrating ability to provide services described herein.

Responses under this notice must be emailed by Wednesday, 14 March at 12:00 PM CST. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination not to compete this and future requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interesting parties in responding to this notice. The Government is not obligated and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.

Please email, Sheronda Stewart at sheronda.stewart@va.gov with responses or questions regarding this requirement. This notice will close on Wednesday, 14 March at 12:00 PM CST.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification for Single Source Awards IAW FAR 13.106-1
For
Over Micro-Purchase Threshold but Not Exceeding the SAT ($150K)


Acquisition Plan Action ID:  VA250-18-AP-6274

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 10, Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Station 506, 2215 Fuller Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48105-2303.

Brief Description of Supplies/ Services required and the intended use/Estimated Amount:  The estimated amount of this procurement is $4,399.00 which has been certified on Purchase Request No.: 506-18-2-022-2760 to purchase 1 Boxes, Titanium Clip, Cor-Knot Kits (MPN): 031350.

 These Titanium Clips are used during scheduled surgical procedures.  This item will be  purchased from LSI Solutions, Inc. 7796 Victor Mendon Road, Victor, NY 14564-8966.
 The item is required to be delivered on or before March 12, 2018.
Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used:  
 The COR-KNOT FASTENER provides a strong, secure and safe alternative to hand- tied knots.  This item is proprietary to LSI Solutions, Inc. and is the manufacturer and  sole distributor of this product.  The COR-KNOT DEVICE has several key benefits  that distinguish it as a leading suture fastening system.
 CONTROL
    Exquisite remote suture tensioning 
    Unsurpassed visibility of prosthetic-tissue interface
    One device simultaneously fastens and trims suture
 SPEED
    Faster and easier than hand tying
    Place fastener and precisely trim suture in seconds 
    May reduce cardiopulmonary bypass time
 SECURITY
    Low profile, always strong mechanical fastener
    Unparalleled automated reliability
    Excellent hemodynamic and clinical results
 This item dissolves within the human body and is used during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures.  Therefore, no 2268 is required for this procurement.  In addition, this is an emergent procurement and is required for a scheduled surgical procedure at the facility.    
Description of market research conducted and results or statement why it was not conducted:  Reviewed FPDS-NG, GSA, MedSurg Online Catalogs, NAC, for vendors with similar items without success. A google search was also conducted only to provide ineffective results.  There are currently no SDVOSB or VOSB organizations that are authorized to distribute this proprietary product.

Introduction
This Sources Sought Notice provides the opportunity for interested parties to submit statements of capabilities to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Real Property (ORP) to move/relocate a one story log structure constructed between 1795 and 1801 by Samuel Merrick.  The property is currently on the site of the Washington Crossing National Cemetery.  Maps and photographs of the property are included as Attachment 1 to this notice.
Description and Significance of the Property
The Merrick Log House is currently located within the Washington Crossing National Cemetery.  Residential properties of the Village of Dolington are located south of the property.  
The main block of the Merrick Log House was constructed between 1795 and 1800 by Samuel Merrick, a shoemaker.  Merrick conveyed the property, consisting of approximately 12 acres, to John Cadwallader on April 1, 1807.  The property transferred a number of times during the first half of the 19th century.  Alonzo Balderston retained the property from 1917 until his death in 1940.  The property remained in the Balderston family until 2007, when Ann P. and Janet U. Balterston conveyed it to Dolington Land, L.P.  The U.S Department of Veterans Affairs acquired the property in 2008.
The property was determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places in December 2008 under Criterion D for its potential to yield information about materials, usage, construction practices and dwelling forms of early cultural groups of Bucks County. The period of significance corresponds to the dwelling s date of construction, ca. 1800.
In 1990, the house was identified as one of only two log houses in Upper Makefield Township as part of a countywide historic resources survey.  At that time the Samuel Merrick Log House was described as having the better integrity of the two buildings.  The current configuration of the structure developed over the period of 1800 to 1940.  In 1870, a wagon shed was added.  In the 1920s a four bay, one room deep, frame shed addition was added to the west elevation.  In the 1930s, a three bay, one room deep frame shed addition was added to the south (rear) elevation.  And in the 1940s a hip roof addition was added to the southwest corner, connecting the two shed additions.
The structure is vacant and is not currently associated with any use.  VA NCA has mothballed the house to protect it from damage and deterioration.  The conditions of the structure are detailed in a Historic Structures Report (HSR) prepared by John Milner and Associates, Inc., in May 2011.  The HSR also contains additional maps, photographs, architectural drawings and historical information that may be helpful in developing a proposal for the rehabilitation of the property.  To request a copy of the HSR, contact Ed Hooker, III, VA NCA Historic Architect, 202-632-6631, or William.Hooker@va.gov.  
Questions and Answers
All questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing to the project manager by February 6, 2018 to allow VA sufficient time to respond in writing.  VA will answer all questions received in a single document that will be sent to all registered interested parties.  Oral instructions or explanations provided will not be binding.  Questions should be addressed to maina.gakure@va.gov with a copy email to Ed Hooker, III, NCA Historic Architect, Willliam.Hooker@va.gov.

The proposed action is to conduct analysis of Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA) and PIA submissions to ensure compliance in accordance with Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002, which requires all Federal agencies to conduct PIAs for all new and substantially changed IT systems that collect, maintain, or disseminate personally-identifiable information (PII) and/or protected health information (PHI).  The Government also requires support to review, verify and assess each PTA and PIA submission for conformance with privacy and related regulatory requirements, as well as provide technical support to manage, administer and update the tools and databases used in the PIA review process.

Introduction:
The West Palm Beach VA Medical Center has a requirement to create a Smart Phone app to improve veteran access to VA suicide prevention programs and tools.  The app will be implemented in stages, with West Palm Beach being the primary focus. As the app is implemented and the system moves through the phases, more features will be added, and it will be expanded to more sites. 
Phase I - Create app with One Touch Button Calling an Agency (Similar to Life Alert, Life line, etc.). 
Have the button available via BOTH
App
Device
Veteran Provider is notified by Agency each time the Veteran utilizes the App/Device. 
Target Population: 
REACH Vet population
Pilot the System with 20-50 Veterans from West Palm Beach VAMC
(Baseline is 40-70 Veteran contacts are received per month)
Provide Free Phone with free data or provide a Device to call for Help. 

Phase II - Improve app to include additional generalized  Buttons 
Personalized Safety Plan
Coping Skills
Problem Solving
Stress Reduction
Have Shortcut on widgets screen to call for Help (like the current Emergency button is on the locked home screen)

Phase III - Incorporate other Mental Health Apps into the Main App
 Each of buttons could have link to the current app s we have available within the VA (i.e.; PTSD/Mindfulness/ CPT apps)
Phase IV - Link CPRS (Computerized Patient Record System) to the App to create provider notes/provider notifications each time the App Help Button is used. 
Link the Patient Safety Plan in CPRS to the personalized patient safety plan in the APP (include Health Factors)

Phase V - Implement a Full standing call center managed by VA Providers and phase out Agency contract (Life alert/Life Line, etc.). 

Phase VI - Expand Pilot/Project to other agencies with VISN 8
Phase VII - Expand Project VA Nationwide

<p>1) High Accuracy Arm with seven axis (joints) of movement that includes the following:<br />a. Single Point Repeatability of 0.002 inches. <br />b. Fully integrated scanner designed to capture 3D point data across a range of surface types. It must not require any calibrations, warm-up time or additional cables and controllers and be able to capture 500,000 points per second or greater with a scanning system accuracy of 0.0033 inches. <br />c. Counterbalance System to minimize torque in the base of the arm, allowing effortless user movement, greater accuracy and a variety of mounting options, including lightweight tripods and magnetic and vacuum bases.<br />d. Lock mechanism to lock the arm safely in the rest position when not in use, or conveniently fix the arm in any intermediate position during measurement.<br />e.

Dimensions must be able to be extracted from measured point clouds, polygonal models built from point clouds, or probed points. Nominal dimensions must also be extracted from a CAD model or a reference measured part. It must allow the integration of all manually-operated and numerically-controlled point cloud digitizing and single-point probing 3D measurement technologies within a common framework to include full CAD 3D modeling capabilities within the software package.</p>

<p>4. Supplies Required<br />The requested semiochemical lures when combined with a variety of traps have been shown to be an effective monitoring tool for L. botrana.

The USDA APHIS PPQ has been tasked by Congress with detecting, monitoring and managing these insects. These insects, should they become established, would have irreversible impacts on natural resources, hinder trade and increase costs of productions. Ultimately, an eradication and/or control program could cost millions of dollars if these insects were to go undetected in our environment.</p>
<p>5. Product Specifications<br />Lobesia botrana lure - with the following semiochemicals:<br />&bull; E7,Z9-dodecadien-1-ol acetate (E7,Z9-12:Ac).<br />&bull; Minimum 1mg load rate in each lure</p>

<CONTACT>Jacquelyn P. Lyne, Email Jacquelyn.P.Lyne@usps.gov
<DESC>The U. S. Postal Service plans to issue a Fixed Price Contract to complete a security project at the Los Angeles Bell CA NDC located at 5555 Bandini Blvd, Bell, CA 90801. All work will be done in accordance with USPS approved specifications and drawings.
<p>The estimated cost range of the project is $1,200,000 to $1,400,000 with construction completion within 300 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. Contractors must submit a Qualification Statement and a Management Plan with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered.<br />To be considered, a company must meet the following minimum requirements:<br />(1) Contractors must be licensed, as required by the State, to perform the work as stated in this solicitation. USPS does not exempt suppliers from licensure for federal projects unless indicated otherwise in the solicitation. <br />(2) Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five-year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five-year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained, this should also be clearly explained. <br />(3) Contractor must be capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for 100% of the contract price.<br />(4) Contractors must provide their EMR rating on insurance company letterhead. If the EMR rating is greater than 1.0, the contractor must provide an explanation from its insurance company in order to be given further consideration for prequalification.<br />(5) Company must submit information for three comparable projects that have either been completed within the past five years or are currently ongoing. Comparable projects are defined as renovation projects with similar scopes of work and costs of $500,000 or more.</p>
<p>The Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated: experience/performance and capabilities. The price proposals for only the most highly qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>The Postal Service is more concerned with making an award at the lowest overall price than with obtaining superior technical or management features. However, the Postal Service may not necessarily make an award at the lowest price in order to achieve a small price savings if better value can be achieved with superior technical or management features. The benefits of a higher priced proposal may merit a higher price. The evaluation factors outlined in Section 2-26.2, of the Supplying Principles and Practices, listed in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of proposals.<br />prequalified contractors will be placed on a list for inclusion in future solicitations in this area with similar scopes of work. There is no guarantee that a specific number of solicitations will be issued to these prequalified contractors.</p>
<p>A PRE PROPOSAL MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE SITE ON MARCH 20, 2018, AT 11:00 A.M. PACIFIC TIME. ATTENDANCE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p>The SOLICITATION PACKAGE and all applicable attachments are posted in Emptoris.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO Paige Lyne at Jacquelyn.p.lyne@usps.gov , Tom Pio at Thomas.m.pio@usps.gov or Nikhil Soni at Nikhhil.Soni@usps.gov. Deadline for questions is noon on 3-27-18.</p>
<p>Submit proposals via Emptoris, the USPS esourcing venue.

Technical and past performance, when combined, are N/A. (Contracting Officer state, in accordance with FAR15.304, the relative importance of all other evaluation factors, when combined, when compared to price.)
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award<BR><BR>(a) Inspection/Acceptance. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights (1) within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.

performance of this contract to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3727).

Failure of the parties to this contract to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal or action arising under or relating to this contract shall be a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract.
(e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.
(f) Excusable delays.

The

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<BR><BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the
Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<BR><BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the
Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command
