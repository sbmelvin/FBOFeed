Hosting companies would have to be able to comply with applicable Information Assurance (IA) requirements and operate in the Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) Network and the Non-classified Internet Protocol Router (NIPR) Network.  Work on SIPR Networks requires Contractors that can assure proper training and clearance of their personnel in compliance with the DoD Secret clearance level. <BR><BR>This acquisition will be a full and open competition using FAR Part 15 procedures.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Centerplans to issue a NASA Research Announcement for Development of	Low-Emissions CombustorConcepts and Associated Fuel Control Valves.The projected expansion of the air transportation system by a factor of two or threewithin the next two decades will increase the aviation contribution to climate changethrough emission of greenhouse gases, NOX, water vapor, and particulates.  The impact ofaviation on noise within communities surrounding airports will also increase with growthin air traffic.  A balanced approach to achieving dramatic reductions in fuel burn,emissions, and noise is the focus of current NASA research.  The research includesdevelopment of advanced airframe and propulsion technologies, along with integration ofthese technologies, to achieve simultaneous decreases in fuel burn, emissions, and noisefor future aircraft.  While the future air transportation system will include a mix ofdifferent types of aircraft that includes subsonic fixed wing (SFW), supersonictransports, and rotorcraft, SFW aircraft are expected to be the predominant mode of airtransportation for the foreseeable future.This NASA Research Announcement (NRA) entitled Research and Development of Low-EmissionsCombustor Concepts and Associated Fuel Control Valves solicits research proposals thatoffer new and creative solutions to meeting the N+2 NOx performance goals of theEnvironmentally Responsible Aviation Project. NASA goals are to expand the viable andwell-informed trade space for vehicle design decisions and enable simultaneousrealization of National noise, emissions, and performance goals. With this solicitation,NASA is seeking proposals that will identify new combustor concepts capable of meeting orexceeding the N+2 NOx goal by: 	Developing and investigating novel low emission combustion technologies, inflametube experiments, that demonstrate NOx emissions that meet or exceed the N+2emissions goals.	Developing fuel actuation technologies to enable control of combustioninstabilities that could potentially be encountered in these low emissions combustiontechnologies. 	An optional task to extend these successful novel low emission combustiontechnologies to a multi-injector sector at full engine pressures. The total funds anticipated to be available for baseline awards offered in this NRA are2.3 million dollars, which will allow selection of multiple awards depending on themerits of the submitted proposals. The total funding anticipated for optional awards is1.5 million dollars. The typical period of performance for an award in the baselineprogram is two years with an option for an additional year. Organizations of every type,domestic and foreign, for profit and not-for-profit may submit proposals withoutrestriction on number or teaming arrangements. Participation in this program is open toall categories of organizations. It is open to industry, educational institution, andother non-profit organizations. It is NOT open to other government agencies, FederallyFunded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and NASA Centers or to their employees.NASA employees are NOT permitted to be co-principal investigators on these proposals.  The ANTICIPATED release date of the NRA via NSPIRES is on or about May 28, 2010 withanticipated offer due dates of on or about June 28, 2010. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>Recovery  This notice is provided for information purposes only.  NASA LaRCintends to issue a fixed-price contract to Wyle Laboratories, Inc. entitled Low BoomCommunity Response.  This competitive action will be funded by the American Reinvestmentand Recovery Act (ARRA). This award results from a competitive selection under theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters released NASA ResearchAnnouncement (NRA) for foundational research in support of the Aeronautics ResearchMission Directorate (ARMD), entitled "Research Opportunities in Aeronautics (ROA) 2009under NNH09ZEA001N, Amendment 4, A.4 Supersonics Project (SUP1) (Recovery Act Funds) Sonic Boom Modeling.   The Supersonics Project is aligned with the Aeronautics ResearchMission Directorate (ARMD) principles of maintaining intellectual stewardship ofaeronautical core competencies for the nation in supersonic flight technologies andresearch appropriate to NASAs unique capabilities.  The Project supports the FundamentalAeronautics Program strategy of developing systems level multidisciplinary capabilities(e.g., airframe design, engine design, airspace modeling and simulation) for supersoniccivilian and military applications.  The Supersonics Project is a broad-based effortdesigned to develop knowledge, capabilities and technologies that support vehicles thatfly supersonic by eliminating the efficiency, environmental and performance barriers topractical supersonic cruise vehicles. The Project has identified a set of key TechnicalChallenges that are barriers to success for this vehicle type.	The efforts described inthis SOW address the Sonic Boom Modeling Technical Challenge.Successful supersonic civil aircraft must be capable of supersonic flight over land.However, the sonic boom that occurs when aircraft travel at speeds greater than sound isperhaps the most significant environmental barrier to supersonic commercial flight.  Inthe near term, the Supersonics project is emphasizing understanding and overcoming thisbarrier, both through the development of approaches to reducing sonic boom noise andimproving understanding of the impact of these reduced noise booms.The Supersonics Project is developing technologies that potentially will lower a sonicboom to levels acceptable to the general community.  There is very little data on theeffects of such booms, and the project therefore has adopted a three-pronged approach tostudying the atmospheric effects, transmission into structures (living area of a typicalresidence and a large multi-cubical office environment), and human reaction to thesebooms. In this effort, the Contractor shall design and execute an experiment to gather datarelating the impact to community residents resulting from sonic boom exposure consistingof multiple low-boom events generated by existing aircraft.  The Contractor shall acquiredata of sufficient quantity and quality to enable a thorough evaluation of the surveymethods used, data acquired, and analysis methods employed.  The effectiveness of thetest methodology for community response testing shall be demonstrated.	The Contractorshall identify and address issues related to conducting future experiments with a navecommunity not previously subjected to sonic booms, including the identification ofstrategies to minimize transient/adaptation effects associated with the introduction of anew noise source to a community.Components of the experimental design that shall be addressed include: noise exposure(levels and numbers of sonic booms), number of participants and their selection, subjectquestionnaire design, and data acquisition methods (both acoustical and meteorological).Questionnaire design shall enable comparisons to be made with results from previous sonicboom and community noise surveys. The questionnaire shall be pre-tested before the flighttests begin, and survey methodologies shall be developed in sufficient detail to providethe material necessary to secure OMB approval for data collection from the general publicin future experiments.The referenced solicitation is a broad agency announcement as specified in FAR 35.016 andNFS 1835.016. Additional information regarding the 2009 ROA solicitation can be found athttp://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method =init&solId={8AA62753-0F6B-3791-4A43-3DEF562FA257}&path=open (ROA-2009 CompleteSolicitation as of November 24, 2009).

GOVPAY
GOVPAY ELECTRONIC INVOICINGAll payment requests must be submitted electronically through GovPay.  "Payment request" means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment by a contractor. To constitute a proper invoice, the GovPay payment request must conform to the requirements identified in FAR 32.905(b), "Payment Documentation and Process" and FAR 52.232-25, "Prompt Payment (OCT 2008)". To ensure the timely processing of invoices GovPay uses an automated "workflow" process to route invoices for review, approvals and payment; as required by the "Prompt Payment Act". Detailed GovPay information for use of GovPay may be obtained on the Internet at www.govpay.gov.  This web site includes user manuals, training resources, instructions for registration and contact information for the GovPay help desk for additional support.  All users can access reports on the status of their invoices. Supporting documentation shall be attached to the GovPay invoice in the form of "flat files" in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) and an Adobe PDF file.  There is a 15MB limitation on file size for these attachments, per header or line item.  Facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents are NOT acceptable electronic forms for payment requests.   GovPay uses the contractor information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as one of the components for validating contractor registration.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to submit accurate and current CCR information.  Failure to register and maintain CCR information, or if it has expired, been suspended, been deleted, or could not be found, will result in rejection of your invoice.  An invoice submitted during the period for which information in the CCR could not be verified must be resubmitted for payment after successfully registering or updating registration in CCR.  Contractors are encouraged to review their CCR information to ensure the most current information is available for GovPay. The CCR Assistance Center is available to provide assistance and answer questions.  They can be reached at 1-888-227-2423 or on the web at http://www.ccr.gov. [End of clause]

SYNOPSIS
"Downtown" Moose Creek, in the Kantishna Hills area of DENA, is the site of extensive aquatic, riparian, and upland mining-related impacts.  Stream course locations of both Moose Creek and Eldorado Creek are in channels constructed as by-pass measures for mining purposes, and for the original construction and maintenance of a mid-floodplain airstrip. Mining pits and tailings piles dot the floodplain and remain devoid of vegetation. Flood events amplify the problem of streamflows characterized by unstable or excessively confined channels, and increased sediment loading from unstable and eroding banks resulting in additional problems downstream, such as cementing of substrates and clogging of benthic invertebrate habitat. Additionally, channel capacities and geometries are not designed in consideration of bankside private lodges or properties located just downstream. Based on previous reclamation projects in DENA, a plan is desired to restore critical riparian and aquatic habitat in Eldorado and Moose Creeks. The focus of the plan involves creating a stable channel geometry, building functional floodplains, and using bioengineered erosion control structures along the banks, in consideration of both near-natural reconstruction of the floodplain and protection of the private properties.  The work also serves to progress wetlands mitigation agreements required under the Clean Water Act. Performance of the work will likely be carefully analyzed and assessed.  
The NPS wishes to retain a hydraulic engineer for data collection, engineering analysis, and engineering design for a comprehensive stream channel and floodplain reclamation plan, for Moose and Eldorado Creeks (Downtown Kantishna).  Additionally, the contractor will be responsible for compiling information and completing requirements for submitting documents to obtain a US Corps of Engineers 404 permit, completing an EPA Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan, and the State of Alaska Fish Habitat permit.  The tasks required to complete the engineering analysis and design for these reclamation plans, and to prepare permitting documents, are described below.  Upon completion of this contract, the NPS will have design and construction documents available for use.  These documents may be used by NPS to conduct the stream reclamation project in-house, using NPS crews, or to provide information for contractors retained by NPS to conduct the reclamation project.  The National Park Service will also have the necessary permitting applications from the US Corps of Engineers and State of Alaska Fish and Game completed, and an EPA-required Stormwater pollution plan on file.  This project consists only of a stream channel, floodplain, and access road reclamation plan.  This project does not require any planning or design work related to mining debris removal and disposal, or hazardous waste treatment or disposal.  
A selection of field sites will be visited and basic site conditions will be surveyed. Park management wishes to acquire the consulting services of a professional engineer with expertise in mined stream reclamation to develop, in conjunction with park scientists, an overall restoration implementation plan for downtown Kantishna.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 332992   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Criminal Investigations Division (CID) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Federal CartridgeCompany of Anoka, MN.  The requirement is for 77 cases of Federal 9 mm Luger Pistol Ammunition, 45 cases of LE132 Police Load 12 gauge Ammunition, and 45 cases of Federal LE127 Tactical Rifle Slugs to be shipped to various locations throughout the United States.  In order to accomplish its essential mission CID requires ammunition for use by its federal law enforcement officers.  The minimum standard for the purchase of ammunition for law enforcement purposes is to maintain quality assurance by purchasing from the manufacturer only.  Firearms and the ammunition that compliments it are used in deadly force situations.  The law enforcement officer must rely on the manufacturer to guarantee that the ammunition used in the firearm will not fail in those situations that the officer is defending human life.  The original manufacturer will guarantee the effectiveness and quality of the ammunition regarding its performance.   In addition, the original manufacturer will also immediately notify the purchasing agency when and if there is a concern regarding the performance of the ammunition or a defect.  The original manufacturer will replace what is in question.  Quality assurance regarding ammunition for law enforcement carry and training is of upmost consideration when an agency purchases ammunition and cannot be undermined.

NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing via e-mail to Schwartz.rachel@epa.gov by May 27, 2010 at 1 PM EST.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.  The decision not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the government.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.
The point of contact for this procurement is Rachel Schwartz, Contract Specialist, at Schwartz.rachel@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The A/E contractor must provide bid-ready design documents 180 calendar days after A/E contract award. Provide construction period services following the construction contract award based upon this design work. Evaluation and selection will be based on qualifications stated under CBD Numbered Note 24. The selected firm or organization must have significant experience in the design of medical laboratories for large health care facilities.

<DESC>Each pipe manufacturer typically has a different method of connecting pipes together, which means that one brand of pipe will not connect to a different brand of pipe without the use of special fittings or adaptors.  Because this office currently has approximately 100,000 total feet of ADS N-12 pipe installed in our various dredge material disposal areas, it is important that future pipe purchases be of the same type of pipe in order to keep the pipes interchangeable.  In this way, if a single pipe is damaged during dredging operation, that pipe can be dug up and replaced by a new pipe.  If a different brand of pipe was used to repair the damage the entire pipe run (up to as many as ten connected pipes) would have to be dug up and replaced with the new brand of pipe because the new pipe would not be able to be connected to the undamaged pipes, resulting in considerable extra expense to the Government.  ADS pipe has been used in our application for the past ten years and has meet and exceeded our expectation for ease or use, functionality, and durability.  This request is for Advanced Drainage Systems (ADS) HDPE corrugated gravity drainage pipe, specifically N-12 ST IB Soil-tight pipe with 36' inside diameter.  In total 54, 20Ft. sections (1080 ft) are needed.  ADS N-12 ST IB Mega Green which is comprised of 40% recycled high density polyethylene is also acceptable in the event there is no pricing discrepancy with regard to the standard HDPE blended pipe.  Product should include appropriate quantities of joint/gasket lubricant and be deliverable to USACE open storage yard located at the corner of Business 98 and 2nd Street in Springfield Florida.

<p>3. Hunley Park - 54 acre parcel located on the west side of Dorchester Road at the intersection of Dorchester and Cross County Road. Bounded on the south by a Charleston AFB family housing area, on the west by wetlands, on the east by Dorchester Road and on the north by vacant land and private residential development.</p>
<p>Information Requested:</p>
<p>Please provide the following information:<br />1. Your identity and a brief description of your experience in developing this kind of project.<br />2. Which parcel or combination of parcels most interests you for developing a project?<br />3. Describe your views of the advantages/disadvantages of developing the three parcels individually and in combination.<br />4. What land uses are most feasible and profitable at the parcels?<br />5. What kind and how large a project would be feasible or optimal and how much land would be required? <br />6. Please explain any concerns you have about base security requirements on such a development.<br />7. How would such a project likely be financed? Do you expect any problems acquiring financing? <br />8. What would be the impacts, particularly financial, of continued Aero Club operations in any development of the Area 2000 parcel? Would continued Aero Club operations affect your interest in responding to any future solicitation? If so, how?<br />9. Would development of these parcels be related to activities at the Port of Charleston?<br />10. Is current infrastructure at the parcels adequate for optimal development of them? If not, what else is required?<br />11. Describe the issues, concerns, and challenges to developing these parcels.</p>
<p>Handling and Processing:<br />All responses received will be considered. Under this Request for Information or under future issuances, the Air Force may terminate or continue to pursue this topic. Under 10 USC &sect; 2667, the Air Force will use competition to pursue any leases, agreements, etc., that may be sought in connection with these properties.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement. There is no solicitation available at this time.
<p>The 319th Contracting Squadron at Grand Forks AFB, ND is conducting market research to determine the existence of certified companies that perform HVAC repair/installation. The Government's estimated construction time for the project is 168 days. This is based on the most current information available to date. Updated information will be posted electronically on Federal Business Opportunities as it becomes available.</p>
<p>The general scope of the requirement is to provide all personnel, tools, equipment, materials, vehicles, supervision and other items and services necessary to replace an existing building's HVAC systems with new zone controlled source heat pump systems and to install a loop field nearby. The maintenance bays will continue to utilize the existing infrared heating system and cooling will not be provided in those areas. All systems and associated equipment taken out of service will be removed. Construction will occur in four stages. Occupants in areas under construction will temporarily relocate to other portions of the building. The first stage will begin in the south section and will install the geothermal well field. The second stage will renovate the central section of the building. The third stage will begin construction on the north portion of the building. The fourth stage of construction will renovate the west office area of the building.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238220, and the small business size standard is $14M. The government anticipates award of a firm fixed price contract.</p>
<p>Any interested and qualified sources are requested to provide a brief capabilities statement and letter of interest to TSgt (Darrell) Scott Haas via email to Darrell.Haas@grandforks.af.mil.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made as a result of this request.  This request for information is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.<BR><BR>1. SCOPE.<BR>Background: The mission of the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) is to rapidly increase mission capability while reducing risk to Soldiers and others by equipping operational commanders with off-the-shelf (government or commercial) solutions or near-term developmental items that can be researched, developed and acquired quickly.  The REF receives requirements from operational commanders in war zones setting forth the capabilities needed.  The REF is chartered by the Senior Army leadership to provide material solutions to meet these requirements in a significantly reduced timeline compared to traditional Department of Defense acquisition procedures.<BR><BR>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain potential solutions to provide personnel / vehicle radar tracking systems.  The REF believes that Counter-Insurgency Operations (COIN) in Iraq and Afghanistan will require the use of micro surveillance radar in order to accomplish these efforts.  Alternative solutions submitted by companies responding to this RFI will also be considered. <BR><BR>Experience and information obtained from this request for information will be provided to Army Product Manager REF who will evaluate the information and feasibility of issuing a procurement action to resolve the stated problem.<BR><BR>2. REQUIREMENTS. <BR>The REF has a need for a radar technology or system that will provide the ability to detect and track personnel and vehicles while stationary and on the move.  The system will operate during day, night and all weather conditions.<BR><BR>2.1.	The system must be quickly affixed to the vehicle without modification to vehicles.<BR>2.1.1  Must have an installation time of less than five minutes.<BR>2.1.2  System must have the ability to be powered from a vehicles auxiliary power output.<BR>2.1.3. The system shall not draw more than 15 Watts.  <BR>2.2.	The system shall have a coverage area greater than 500,000 square meters and 120 degree or greater field of view.<BR>2.3.	The system shall operate in the frequency range between 6-10.5 GHZ.<BR>2.4.	The system must have the ability to detect mobile or stationary personnel and vehicles while the radar system itself is mobile or stationary.<BR>2.5.	System must have the ability to be powered up and operational within 60 seconds.<BR>2.6.	Must have an update rate of one frame per second.<BR>2.7.	System must weigh less than five pounds.<BR>2.8.	Must have the ability to track at least six personnel/vehicles simultaneously.<BR>2.9.	The system must be significantly robust to operate in a rugged environment.<BR>2.9.1.	Operating Temperature Range: -24 Celsius to +50 Celsius.<BR>2.9.2.	Must be able to sustain extensive dust, sand, snow and wind.<BR>	2.14  System must be an off-the-shelf (government or commercial) or a near-term developmental item. <BR><BR>3. DELIVERABLES<BR>Specific information on industry capability to produce a system that can meet the requirements identified in paragraph 2 above, or otherwise solves the problem of identifying and detecting objects being emplaced.<BR><BR>This is NOT a Request for Proposal. Companies who desire to participate in this market survey are encouraged to submit a white paper which supports the companys claim that it presently has the technology, qualifications, and capabilities to satisfy one or more of the performance and technical objectives described above.  The white paper should discuss the companys ability to develop and or provide existing technologies to detect items placed in culverts in Iraq and Afghanistan and should provide a ROM (rough order of magnitude) price and its anticipated delivery for the solution proposed.<BR><BR>The white paper should also discuss related company experience and include point(s) of contact.  The white paper should be prepared in MS Word, limited to ten (10) pages, and submitted electronically to the contracting officer at gregory.wagenknecht@us.army.mil.  The company shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research.  All requests for further information must be made in writing or via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.  The government will review RFI submissions as they are received.  The government reserves the right to close this RFI once they have received adequate response(s) to this RFI.<BR>

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, management, and financial capability of such offerors to perform this type of work.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside is warranted or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is: 541620 Environmental Consulting Services.  The small business size standard for NAICS Code 541620 is $20 million. 
The purpose of the proposed project is for environmental support services in hydrology on the Colorado River and support in meeting attendance of the Colorado River Hydrology Work Group.       
The Colorado River is of strategic importance in the southwestern United States for water supply, hydropower production, recreation, fish and wildlife habitat, and other benefits; and has experienced the worst nine-year drought in recorded history.  In the future, low reservoir conditions may not be limited to drought periods as additional development of Colorado River occurs.  
Reclamation assembled a climate technical workgroup consisting of engineers and scientists with expertise in climate and hydrology for the Final Environmental Impact Statement.  The workgroup was charged with assessing the state of knowledge related to long-term climatic forecasts and providing recommendations as to what methods might be used to evaluate future hydrologic scenarios in the Colorado River basin.  In an effort to pursue these recommendations, Reclamation has re-assembled the Colorado River Hydrology work group for which support and assistance is needed.  The results of this assessment in combination with ongoing related work will be used to advise and advance Reclamation's understanding of the future variability of Colorado River basin hydrology.  
The project period of performance (5 years) is anticipated to begin October 1, 2010 with an anticipated completion date of September 30, 2015. 
Should you be interested in this effort, please submit a capability package to Brian Switzer at the address listed below.  Capability statements are to be submitted no later than June 1, 2010.  The capability statement shall address the work listed above, demonstrate the company's capability to perform the work, and describe previous procurements performed of similar size and complexity.  Additionally, all responses to this sources sought shall include company name and address, business size and type (8(a), HubZone, Small Business, etc), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number.   Capability statements shall not exceed five pages in length.  This information will be used to assist the Contracting Officer in developing the procurement strategy, in particular, including whether an 8(a) or Hubzone set-aside is warranted or if another socio-economic set-aside strategy is more appropriate.  
All responses to this sources sought notice shall be provided to Brian Switzer/LC-10114, Contract Specialist, P. O.  Box 61470, Boulder City, NV 89006-1470 or via e-mail bswitzer@usbr.gov.  
When it is determined that a formal solicitation will be issued, a pre-solicitation notice will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities web site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

The final two year period, years 8 and 9, will serve as the colony close-out period. Animals shall be maintained and disbursed, but entry of animals shall cease at the beginning of year 8 or when entries begin in a renewal contract colony.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  This is not a solicitation request for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this notice.  There will not be a solicitation, specifications or drawings available at this time.
Naval Facilities Engineering Command Mid-Atlantic is seeking Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, certified HUBZone Small Businesses, and certified 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses with current relevant qualifications, experience, personnel and capability to perform this proposed project.  
The project will be located at Building W-5, Norfolk Naval Station, Norfolk, Virginia.
 Building W-5 was constructed in the 1920's as a two-story storage facility. Several years later, a third story was added. Subsequently, it became a brig, a Port Operations Administration Building, and then was converted to office spaces for the Second Fleet Command. Currently the facility is utilized as swing space. This facility is now required for permanent office spaces for Carrier Strike Groups 2, 8, 10 & 12. Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) has the mission requirement to provide office space for the Carrier Strike Groups when they are home ported. 
This project will renovate the existing 24,624 square foot, three-story facility and provide three-story additions on the front and rear of the existing building adding 5,728 additional square feet.  Existing fixtures, finishes and walls in the interior of the existing building will be totally demolished. This project will provide a completely renovated space for public toilets, an Admiral's suite (consisting of three offices, a private toilet, and a conference room), vending space, and open office space on each floor. The existing exterior metal stairs will be removed. Existing windows will be removed and new AT/FP compliant windows provided. The existing roofing system will be removed and new provided. The front addition will provide an ADA compliant entry ramp, exterior entry stair, egress stair, entry vestibule, elevator, badge room, and storage on each floor. The rear addition will provide an egress stair, galley, vending space, mechanical room, and electrical room, loading dock, NIPR/SIPR and telephone rooms. A sprinkler and fire alarm system will be added including a mass notification system and a new water line.  Exterior brick walls will be pointed and repaired as needed.
Site work will remove existing pavement and provide sod, new sidewalks, grass drainage swales, a dumpster enclosure, landscaping, bike rack, flag pole, and relocation of existing steam lines.
This project will also have to comply with AT/FP criteria, LID and LEED Silver certification.
The target award range for this project is $5,000,000.00 to $10,000,000.00.
All Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, certified HUBZone Small Business, certified 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.  The Government will not pay for any information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. One of the main functions of this synopsis is to assist the Contracting Officer in determining whether an 8(a), HUBZone Small Business or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-aside is an acceptable strategy for this procurement.   If a full and open competition is ultimately pursued, responses to this synopsis will be used to aid in establishing small business subcontracting goals.  All qualified firms are encouraged to respond. The Government anticipates a contract award for this project in June 2010.  The appropriate NAICS Code is 236220 with a size standard of 33.5 million dollars.

It is requested that interested parties submit a brief capabilities package. This capabilities package shall address, at a minimum the following:
	(1)	Examples of projects worked within the last five years of similar size, scope and complexity as the work indicated.  Indicate whether your firm worked as a prime or subcontractor, contract value, brief description of how the referenced contract relates to the work described, and a Government / Agency point of contact.
	(2)	Company profile, to include number of employees, annual receipts, office location(s), available bonding capacity in excess of $10,000,000 per contract, DUNS number, and CAGE Code.
	(3) Please indicate if you are an 8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Woman Owned, and Veteran Owned.
The capabilities package for this sources sought notice is not expected to be a proposal, but rather a short statement regarding the company's ability to demonstrate existing, or developed, expertise and experience in relation to this project.  Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the capabilities package.   Submission of a capabilities package is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Navy in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities.  
Responses to this Sources Sought Notice shall be mailed to the following address:  Commander, NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic, Attn Joycelyn Sharp-Clark, 9324 Virginia Avenue, Room, 309, Bldg Z-140,  Norfolk, VA 23511.  Responses must be received no later than 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time on 11 March 2010.  Electronic submission will not be accepted.  Questions regarding this sources sought notice may be addressed to Joycelyn Sharp-Clark at the above address, via email at joycelyn.sharpclark@navy.mil, or via phone at 757-445-8972.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, National Geospatial Programs Office has a requirement for high resolution orthophotography and LiDAR in eastern Nebraska.
The coverage area for the high resolution orthophotography will be Omaha, Council Bluffs, Lincoln, and surrounding areas in eastern Nebraska, an area of approximately 4,511 square miles.  The USGS has the opportunity to obtain all this orthophotography from the Omaha-Council Bluffs Metro Planning Agency at 19% of the cost of the entire project because other agencies and local governments are contributing to this project.  The orthophotography data shall be collected to the following specifications:  1) This project will be collected with Leica ADS digital sensors  2) Flight is supported with differentially corrected Airborne GPS (ABGPS) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data  3) Capture at an altitude sufficient to support a pixel size less than or equal to the desired orthophoto pixel resolution  4) No pan-sharpening will be performed on the imagery  5) 100% forward overlap in the direction of flight  6) 30% side lap between adjacent flight lines  7) 80% side lap in areas with concentrations of tall buildings (i.e. downtown).
The coverage area for the LiDAR data will be Omaha, Council Bluffs, Lincoln, and surrounding areas in eastern Nebraska, an area of approximately 1,991 square miles.  The USGS has the opportunity to obtain all this LiDAR data from the Omaha-Council Bluffs Metro Planning Agency at 44% of the cost of the entire project because other agencies and local governments are contributing to this project.  The LiDAR data shall be collected to the following specifications:  1) The contractor shall utilize an ALS 50 Phase II LiDAR sensor to collect the LiDAR data for the areas specified   2) The contractor shall acquire the LiDAR data during leaf-off, no snow on the ground conditions   3) The contractor shall fly the LiDAR mission as close as possible with the aerial imagery mission. The imagery will assist in processing the LiDAR data to bare-earth and for break line compilation   4) The bare-earth LiDAR will be used for rectification of the imagery in the areas of coverage  5) The LiDAR will be collected at 1.4 meter ground sample distance (GSD)
All deliverable data and documentation shall be free from restrictions regarding use and distribution.  
Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253, implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the government considers these items specified as a sole source from the Omaha-Council Bluffs Metropolitan Area Planning Agency (MAPA), 2222 Cuming St, Omaha, NE 68102-4328 and proposes to negotiate with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and provide considerable cost sharing are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-response to this request without further consideration.  Affirmative response shall be received by this office by close of business June 3, 2010 by 3:00 PM Mountain Standard Time.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is in the process of seeking a near-term replacement for the Automated Fire Extinguishing System (AFES) in Marine Corps tactical wheeled vehicles (TWVs) identified herein. This RFI seeks to obtain data from sources that are capable of fully satisfying this need. The information requested is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind. Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create the resulting acquisition strategy for a potential requirement. Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received and are encouraged not to provide proprietary data or business sensitive information as any information received may be used by the Government and / or released to the public. However, proprietary information received in response to this market research synopsis will be safeguarded and protected in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Proprietary information submitted as a result of this market research shall be marked in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(e). The Government is seeking suitable commercial items, developmental items, or commercial items that can be easily modified to meet existing Government requirements. Information on capable sources is sought for the following desired characteristics: 
The system must provide the ability to protect Marines against internal cab fires caused by Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and other munitions.  An aqueous based, non-toxic fire suppression agent and delivery system mounted in the vehicle cab is desired.  The fire suppression agent should also employ cooling properties which immediately cool the cab environment and provide protection from skin burns to personnel in the cab.  The system should be designed to be automatically activated by system sensors that detect a fire event and should also provide a manual discharge option. The system shall be compatible with a vehicle electrical system per MIL-STD-1275, characteristics of 28 volt DC Electrical Systems in Military Vehicle, without generic any false alarms or suffering to any systems or platform components. The system shall be operated over an input voltage range of 18-30 VDC and is desired to draw no more than 30 amps during extinguisher(s) discharge. The system should not cause hearing damage to occupants of the cab after activation. The Government desires a system comparable in weight and space claim to the current FM 200 AFES system which is currently employed in Marine Corps and Army TWVs.  This system shall be initially designed and tested in Marine Corps HMMWVs and shall have minimal effect on the existing configuration of the HMMWV cab.  The system must not interfere with the crew's ability to egress and ingress of the vehicle.
An Industry Day for interested vendors will be held at Marine Corps Systems Command during November of 2009.  During the Industry Day vendors in attendance will be free to take measurements and photographs of Marine Corps HMMWVs in order to assess cab dimensions, space claim, etc.  Interested parties should contact the Government Contract Specialist listed below for additional information.  Sources capable of satisfying the above requirements should submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessaryinformation to determine actual capability. At a minimum, this information should include: 1) identification of your company or organization, 2) your company's or organization's assertion of existing, full capability to meet proposed requirements, 3) business/contacts/marketing office point(s) of contact information, 4) notification of business size and/or special status and 5) any additional information that may be useful to the successfulprocurement of the requirements, if solicited. These expressions of interest shall adhere to a two (2) pages submission limit, plus commercial marketinginformation or web links and all should be submitted via email to Michelle Etienne at michelle.etienne@usmc.mil, referencing the following tracking #M67854-10-R-5013. 
The information should be submitted on or before 09 Nov 2009. This market research announcement should not be considered a commitment of any kind by the Government and individual correspondence should not be expected inadvance of any resulting pre-solicitation notice for the proposed requirements.

ATTACHMENT: SUBJECT: Follow on Justification, Purchase Request #F2XTA8011A001.
<p><br />MEMORANDUM FOR: 42 CONS</p>
<p>FROM: AFLMA/DD<br /><br />SUBJECT: Follow-on Justification</p>
<p>1. Description of the supplies and services being acquired:</p>
<p>The Air Force Logistics Management Agency (AFLMA) has an ongoing requirement to provide vital programming, modeling, and analysis support to the Air Force. The support provided includes advanced supply analysis covering other aspects of Air Force inventory requirements determination and inventory distribution including (a) recommendations for improving AF inventory stockage policy, (b) recommendations for improving contingency inventory support, (c) improving integrity and quality of data used to determine AF inventory requirements, (d) assisting in the review, loading and deletion of Contingency High Priority Mission Support Kits (CHPMSKs), (e) conducting analysis of RBL code and output, and (f) recommending improvements to AF data systems to improve supply support. Specifically, the AFLMA must complete a number of projects to include, but not limited to, an analysis of the impact of more accurate flying hour predictions for Air Mobility Command, and an ananlysis of the non-optimized formula for wartime requirements for aircraft wheels and tires as well as spare gun parts. Futhermore, research is also required to determine, at an enterprise level, the health of Air Force Logistics processes.</p>
<p>These efforts are performed in conjuction with numerous evaluations of current stockage levels across the Air Force to reduce aircraft downtime and drive readiness. Specific studies/tasks that are currently in work (and not completed from previous contract) by LMI are:</p>
<p>- AF Retention Policy<br />- Requisitioning Objective Holes Compared to Backorders<br />- Non-Optimized Formula for Wheels and Tires<br />- Non-Optimzed Formula for Gun Parts<br />- RBL Problem Item Analysis<br />- EXPRESS Constraints<br />- Inventory Control Part II (Develop a strategy)<br />- Determine Impact of more accurate flying hour prediction<br />- AF Logistics Working Groups<br />- Measuring the Impact of Reduced Order and Ship Time on AF Requirements and Base <br />Levels</p>
<p>These tasks are a follow-on to contract # FA3300-08-C-0005. The quality and timeliness of AFLMA support is critical to ensuring the accuracy and effectiveness of Air Force peacetime and contingency inventory requirements and support. AFLMA estimates the price to complete the above task to be at or about $XXXXXX.</p>
<p>2. Authority and Applicability of Authority: In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for continued provisions of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in "substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition".</p>
<p>LMI is the only one that can finish these projects because they have completed at least 75% of the work associated with them and it would not be beneficial to the Government to bring someone new on the job. No other contractor would have the technical and cooperative knowledge to perform the tasks above without substantial duplication of effort and time. Logistics Management Institute (LMI), is the only company capable of satisfying this requirement.</p>
<p>The time estimated to recompete would be 3 months. The estimated learning curve time for another contractor to reach the current knowledge level of LMI is approximately 12 months. The re-competition time and learning curve delays would result in a day for day slip in AFLMA meeting its requirements and the delivery of much needed capabilities to the Air Force.</p>
<p>The follow-on contract length is less than one year with an expected award in May 2010 for the purpose of completing the present AFLMA task. Future AFLMA contract requirements will be competed when feasible.</p>
<p>3. Justification that source is the only known source:<br /><br />LMI has over 30 years of academic research experience in the Supply (Inventory Management) career field. LMI is the only known source with the required intellectual credentials, years of experience, and current expertise in the Air Force Supply (Inventory Management) field needed to meet the mission requirements of AFLMA. LMI's possesses astute academic research and high level functional leadership not easily found. There is no current government employee of AFLMA that can step in and do the high level of work that LMI does. Market research dictates that in order to fulfill this need, AFLMA would have to hire more than one position to achieve success. This is something that is neither advantageous to AFLMA nor necessary. No other consultant would provide the same benefit to AFLMA's mission.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will make a determination that the final negotiated costs are fair and reasonable before contract award based on historical data and a review of the rates proposed to determine that the rates remain fair and reasonable for the logical follow-on.</p>
<p>4. Actions taken to preclude future sole source acquisitions:<br /><br />This information is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. No action can be taken to preclude future sole source acquisitions under the current conditions. Upon a change in the AFLMA mission requirements, another contractor may be able to fulfill this requirement negating the need for future sole source.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER GSA SCHEDULE 874-1. The ARRA provides over $100 billion for education and is a historic opportunity to stimulate the economy and improve education. The Race to the Top program, authorized under the ARRA, is a competitive grant program designed to encourage and reward States that are creating the conditions for education innovation and reform; implementing ambitious plans in four core education reform areas; and achieving significant improvement in student outcomes, including making substantial gains in student achievement, closing achievement gaps, improving high school graduation rates, and ensuring student preparation for success in college and careers. Race to the Top States will lead the way with ambitious yet achievable plans for implementing coherent, compelling, and comprehensive education reform. Race to the Top winners will help trail-blaze effective reforms and provide examples for States and local school districts throughout the country to follow as they too are hard at work on reforms that can transform our schools for decades to come. The Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) requires the services of a contractor to work with the Department in establishing and implementing a technical assistance network to support the Race to the Top program. The intended audience for these services includes all states, with a portion of the technical assistance dedicated to supporting grantees, and other technical assistance designed to encompass work with all states, especially with respect to sharing effective practices and bringing systemic solutions to scale. Some key goals of the technical assistance include: &bull;Direct impact: Support grantees' efforts to achieve significant improvements in student outcomes &bull;Scaling impact: Help scale effective systemic approaches and practices within and across grantee states and nationwide &bull;Sustain impact and continuous improvement: Facilitate building of sustainable learning communities within and across states and Local Educational Agencies (LEAs) &bull;Nationwide learning: Identify, codify, and share effective (and ineffective) practices to facilitate learning from Race to the Top grantees and others &bull;Productive relationships: Support redefinition of relationships between ED and states, between states and their LEAs, across states, and across similar LEAs &bull;Ensure transparency, accountability, and appropriate, efficient, and effective use of funds. It is anticipated that the resulting contract will be issued on a time and material basis to support a period of performance of 48 months. The contract will include provisions for performance incentives that are aligned with grantee achievement on student outcomes and implementation of Race to the Top plans, and contractor delivery of high quality and relevant service. The Department anticipates issuing a solicitation to a pool of vendors under GSA's Federal Supply Schedule 874-1. Issuance of the solicitation is planned for early June 2010 and with contract award before September 30, 2010. Interested GSA Schedule 874-1 holders with expertise and experience in the following areas are invited to participate: (a) system-wide and statewide education reform efforts, (b) professional capacity building at the state and district levels, (c) standards-based curriculum, instruction, and assessment, (d) data-driven continuous instructional improvement, (e) teacher and principal evaluation and feedback systems, (f) low-performing school turnaround efforts, (g) evaluation of practices, (h) identifying, codifying, sharing, and replicating effective education practices, (i) knowledge management and sharing of education resources, (j) interacting with and providing services to states and (k) logistic support. Please contact Cynthia Duncan at cynthia.duncan@ed.gov or on (202) 245-6196 for additional information.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, through the Program Support Center, Strategic Acquisition Service, intends to award a sole source contract in accordance with Parts 6.302-1 (a)2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation to Research and Evaluation Solutions, Inc. (REESSI)  6188 B Old Franconia Road, Alexandria, VA 22310. The purpose of this acquisition is to provide professional services to develop and implement standardized outcomes and measures for the pilot Women of Faith Advocacy initiative. The Office on Womens Health requires the services of the Research and Evaluation Solutions, Inc. (REESSI) to continue their participation (as a private research firm) in our pilot Women of Faith Advocacy initiative which is designed to meet the needs of women experiencing gender-based violence and who identify themselves as members of a faith community.  Program contractors educate and equip faith-based organizations to create healthy and safe congregations focusing on the primary prevention and intervention of issues related to Violence Against Women. Prior to and following the implementation of such programs, REESSI will update and refine the standardized outcome measures, collect additional information, provide recommendations to OWH and publish reports on the outcomes of the Women of Faith Advocacy Pilot Initiative. REESSI will also develop and implement a project plan for the teen dating violence prevention project.

The Office on Womens Health (OWH) require this acquisition to be a sole source because the Research and Evaluation Solutions, Inc. (REESSI) acts as the only institutional entity of its kind that has had a primary role in providing peer based technical assistance on evaluation issues to OWH grantees for the past five years. The firm is respected by contractors/grantees for their expertise in evaluation and intervention research and willingness to share ideas, concepts and solutions. REESSI has engaged with OWH in performing similar tasks that include the production on an evaluation monograph customized exclusively for programs serving women and girls. Additionally, REESSI is the original developer of the assessment tools for the Women of Faith Pilot Project. Not awarding this contractor will adversely affect the outcomes of the pilot project and the information needed for OWH to develop a program focused on preventing and addressing gender-based violence in faith-based communities. Hence, this contract meets regulations as stated in FAR 6.302-1.  Moreover, the services of this contract foster outreach and support the mission of OWH, to eliminate health disparities among minority populations and promote health for women and girls across the lifespan. To that end, Research and Evaluation Solutions, Inc. (REESSI) is the only responsible source that will meet the needs of the Government. 

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES AND SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITHY OF FAR 6.302-1. INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 10 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, through the Program Support Center, Strategic Acquisition Service, intends to award a sole source contract in accordance with Parts 6.302-1 (a) 2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation to Garden of Hope Community Development Center  1317 E. Brambleton Ave., Norfolk, VA 23504. The purpose of this acquisition is to provide professional services to develop and implement the First Lady as an Advocate Program (FLAP). The Office on Womens Health requires the services of the Garden of Hope Community Development Center to participate in our pilot Women of Faith Advocacy initiative which is designed to meet the needs of women experiencing gender-based violence and who identify themselves as members of a faith community.  The FLAP is a training program designed to educate and equip First Ladies (female spouses of clergy), female lay leaders and healthcare ministry leaders to create healthy and safe congregations focusing on the primary prevention and intervention of issues related to Violence Against Women. 

The primary purpose of this contract is for the development of a method/approach which will meet the needs of women of faith who experience gender-based violence and to implement programs within a targeted faith community in a specific geographical area to increase the participation of the faith community in prevention and intervention activities focused on areas under the auspices of Violence Against Women (domestic violence, intimate partner violence, sexual assault, stalking, etc.). 

The Office on Womens Health (OWH) requires this acquisition to be sole source because the Garden of Hope Community Development Center (CDC) acts as the only institutional entity of its kind in the Hampton Roads area that works to improve the health of women through programming which focuses on linking the communities of faith to community service providers focusing on violence against women.  The Garden of Hope, CDC is leading the way in Hampton Roads in integrating the social and human service disciplines into the fabric of the faith institution.  The Garden of Hope, CDC is one of the three original pilot sites in the Women of Faith Advocacy initiative and their services are still needed to complete the project. Not awarding this contractor will adversely affect the outcomes of the pilot project and disrupt the process OWH has implemented to develop a program focused on preventing and addressing gender-based violence in faith-based communities. Hence, this contract meets regulations as stated in FAR 6.302-1.  Moreover, the services of this contract foster outreach and support the mission of OWH, to eliminate health disparities among minority populations and promote health for women and girls across the lifespan. Garden of Hope Community Development Center (CDC) is the only responsible source that will meet the needs of the Government.

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R & D Maintenance Services, Inc W91278-09-C-0020 Operation and Maintenance of Government Owned Facilities<br><br>Using Recovery Act funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-09-C-0020, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway, Columbus, Mississippi, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815, Hennessey, Oklahoma.  The contractor will: supply required floating plant to include tow boat, 300 ton crane and barge to support the lock closures on the Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway and Black Warrior & Tombigbee systems.  Contract clauses required for this project involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the basic contract. This existing contract must be used because - 1)  This contract enables work to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on commercial shipping and the economy.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation , and, to the maximum extent practicable, making fixed-price (FP) contract awards using competitive procedures.  However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts.  Although Mobile District's contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk.  In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles for the work anticipated under this modification.  <BR>

<SOLNBR>M6785410R0203

<CONTACT>
<DESC>Marine Corps Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S); Industry DayConference Notice; Purpose: The Program Executive Office, Land Systems (PEO LS) CAC2S Program Manager, and the Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM),Quantico, VA, will host an Industry Day conference on 10 June 2010 at American Systems, 3600 Pointe Center Court, Second Floor, Dumfries, VA 22026. The CAC2S Industry Day will provide industry with a description of the current state of the CAC2S Program. Industry will be provided an opportunity to ask questions about the program and the intended future solicitations. The intent of the Industry Day is to provide advance information about the program to Industry and obtain feedback to assist MARCORSYSCOM with structuring future solicitations. 

Background: PEO LS is the Corps' first PEO and is comprised of eightweapons systems programs. PEO LS is a separate command, reporting directlyto the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research Development andAcquisition (ASN RDA). PEO LS maintains an integral relationship with MarineCorps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) (http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil) thatleverages infrastructure, competencies and technical authority. 

Requirement: PEO LS and MARCORSYSCOM are interested in pursuing a programmatic approach that will lead to the acquisition of systems to meet the Marine Corps' need for a modernized, expeditionary, modular, scalable, and adaptable aviation command and control capability. The revised acquisition strategy is based on an evolutionary acquisition approach that will facilitate rapid development and fielding of capabilities in increments and phases.  Increment I collectively groups requirements into the following functional areas:  Communications Subsystem (CS), Processing and Display Subsystem (PDS), and Sensor Data Subsystem (SDS). The CS and PDS baseline requirements will be met through modification of existing Marine Corps Systems Command fielded equipment, specifically upgrades to the AN/MRQ-12(v)3 Communications Interface System (CIS), which is currently fielded with the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS), and upgrades to the AN/TSQ-239 Combat Operations Center (COC), a system that is widely fielded throughout the Marine Corps.  The SDS will be developed and fielded upon the baseline hardware foundation created by the early implementation of the CS and PDS following an assessment of mature technologies than can meet SDS requirements.  

Conference: Meeting Location: American Systems, 3600 Pointe Center Court, Second Floor, Dumfries, VA 22026

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements.</p>
<p><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements.

A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written (formal) solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), solicitation number FA7000-10-T-0043, in accordance with FAR Parts 12 &amp; 13. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-41, 13 April 2010. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 423430 and the size standard is 100 employees. This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. All responsible sources may submit a quote, which if received timely, will be considered by the 10th Contracting Squadron, USAF Academy (USAFA).
<p>Please read and comply with all requirements for submitting a quote. Failure to comply with all instructions contained within this combined synopsis/solicitation could result in the quote being ineligible for award. It is the offeror's responsibility to ensure their quote meets all the requirements identified herein.</p>
<p>The USAF Academy has a Brand Name Only requirement to purchase HP Printers and Memory further described below. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 39 requires Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPV6) capable IT equipment. Through experience and testing other brands, HP has demonstrated over the past 13 years to be the only Brand Name that has experienced printer life cycle of 6 or more years. HP has demonstrated the high-speed volume capability and robust life cycle standards required for the heavy use by USAFA customers. Although other printers meet the technical needs of USAFA, only HP has proven to have an extended life cycle. Therefore, HP Printers provide a more cost effective solution for USAFA's printing needs. The Government has been mandated to consider factors that will lead to not only savings, but significant cost savings. Analysis shows a longer life cycle will result in significant savings to the USAFA. An extended life cycle results in better management of USAFA's limited funding resources and equipment allocation.</p>

During increased Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs), entry requirements to the installation may change with little to no notice. During FPCON Charlie, contractors without a "C" on their CAB may be denied access. Depending on the incident or threat, all personnel to include contractors may be denied access to the installation for safety/security reasons.<br />(I) Contractors are subject to spot checks or inspections of their vehicles and personal items at entry control points or facility access points during higher threats or during random antiterrorism measure checks. Failure to comply with these added security measures may result in denial of access to the installation.<br />(II) Contractors are encouraged to receive Antiterrorism Awareness Training annually available at no cost, but it is not required in CONUS. Installation, Mission Element or the Unit Antiterrorism Representative (ATR) can provide this training when requested. Contractors can play an important role in protecting the installation and are encouraged to report suspicious activity to Security Forces by either calling 911 during emergencies or 333-2000.<br />(ii) Operations Security (OPSEC): As applicable based on the scope and nature of the contract, the contractor shall comply with Government OPSEC guidance and training as prescribed in AFI 10-701, Operations Security, Chapter 4, paragraph 4.1 and AFI 33-332, Privacy Act, for handling of For Official Use Only (FOUO) information and HQ 10 ABW/CC Memorandum, USAFA Operations Security (OPSEC) Policy.

Criminal history checks may include accessing the appropriate state crime information center and national crime information center database to include, but not limited to, any state listed by the employee as current and past addresses. If this contract requires that any of the contractor's personnel must submit to a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) background check, the Government shall bear the expense of that background check. Contractor employees found in violation of this process will be immediately removed from Academy grounds, are subject to barment, and will not be allowed to re-enter until completion of the CAB process. <br />(ii) Convictions. Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years shall constitute indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer (CO), with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require denial of access or removal of the employee from the effort under this contract. For felony convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the contractor may recommend the employee be retained on the contract. In addition, any misdemeanor conviction in the past five (5) years shall also constitute indisputable grounds, with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to restrict or immediately remove employees from effort under this contract. <br />(I) Applicable convictions include: Murder; Assault with intent to commit murder; Espionage; Sedition (Conspiracy); Kidnapping or hostage taking; Treason; Rape or aggravated sexual abuse; Unlawful possession, use, sale, distribution, or manufacture of an explosive or weapon; Extortion; Distribution or intent to distribute a controlled substance; Illegal possession of a controlled substance; and Any felony conviction involving: Armed or unarmed robbery, Arson, Acts involving a threat, Willful destruction of property, Importation or manufacture of a controlled substance, Burglary or theft, Dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation, Possession or distribution of stolen property, Aggravated assault, Bribery, Violence at international airports (18 USC 37), or Conspiracy or attempt to commit any of the criminal acts listed above or any violations of immigration and naturalization laws. <br />(II) Actions that involve restrictions or removal do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(iii) Warrants. If during the course of the CABs processing, any contractor personnel are found to have an outstanding warrant, Security Forces may detain the contractor employee and may notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities. The 10th Air Base Wing Commander may issue a barment letter based upon the gravity of the offenses surrounding a warrant.<br />(iv) Barment. Employees removed by the CO may also be subject to barment from entering the USAFA. <br />(I) Barment appeals are processed through 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(II) Individuals have 30 days from the date of the initial contractor access denial letter to submit a justification in writing to 10 SFS/S5B, along with any notarized copies of court documents or other documents they determine necessary to rebut the disqualifying information.<br />(III) In the case of a barment based on an outstanding warrant, the contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(IV) The CO may require the contractor to restrict the employee's use on this contract until the case is resolved. <br />(V) Actions that involve barment do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(b) See USAFA implementation procedures below.<br />(1) Added: The contractor shall submit a letter to the CO specifying contractor personnel authorized to sign a USAFA Form 111, Application for Personnel and Vehicle Pass to Work Under Air Force Contract. The contractor shall submit a USAFA Form 111 on each contractor employee requiring access to the installation to perform work cited in the contract. All contractors require issuance of a CAB from the Pass and Registration Center (PRC). CABs will be issued to contractors performing duties on USAFA as identified on the USAFA Form 111 and who require weekly access to the installation for a period of time exceeding 7 days. If required access is less than 7 days, contractors are issued an AF Form 75, Visitor Pass. CABs will be issued for a performance period not to exceed one year. <br />(2) Added: The CO, Contract Specialist (CS) or Sponsoring Official will endorse the USAFA Form 111 and the individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original USAFA Form 111 to the PRC for processing. Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract.

The CO will maintain a copy of the letter and forward the contractor's original letter to PRC. By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written (formal) solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), solicitation number FA7000-10-T-0044, in accordance with FAR Parts 12 &amp; 13. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-41, 13 April 2010. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 423430 and the size standard is 100 employees. This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. All responsible sources may submit a quote, which if received timely, will be considered by the 10th Contracting Squadron, USAF Academy (USAFA).
<p>Please read and comply with all requirements for submitting a quote. Failure to comply with all instructions contained within this combined synopsis/solicitation could result in the quote being ineligible for award. It is the offeror's responsibility to ensure their quote meets all the requirements identified herein.</p>
<p>The USAF Academy has a Brand Name Only requirement to purchase HP Printers and Memory further described below. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 39 requires Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPV6) capable IT equipment. Through experience and testing other brands, HP has demonstrated over the past 13 years to be the only Brand Name that has experienced printer life cycle of 6 or more years. HP has demonstrated the high-speed volume capability and robust life cycle standards required for the heavy use by USAFA customers. Although other printers meet the technical needs of USAFA, only HP has proven to have an extended life cycle. Therefore, HP Printers provide a more cost effective solution for USAFA's printing needs. The Government has been mandated to consider factors that will lead to not only savings, but significant cost savings. Analysis shows a longer life cycle will result in significant savings to the USAFA. An extended life cycle results in better management of USAFA's limited funding resources and equipment allocation.</p>

The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>The US Department of Agriculture currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Natchez, Mississippi, that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 6,534 contiguous rentable square feet of space and 35 parking spaces. The rentable square feet of space shall yield a minimum of 6,534 contiguous ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 5 years, with a 5 year renewal option. The space must be available for occupancy by October 1, 2010. The delineated area is:
<p>North: by a section of Cemetery Road, an un-named tributary, Cemetery Bayou, a section of Pine Ridge Road, Homewood Park subdivision, Illinois Central Gulf Railroad, St. Catherine Creek, Morgantown Road, Oakland Drive and Old Plantation road.</p>
<p>East: by Melvin Bayou, St. Catherine Creek, Hurricane Bayou and Trinity Episcopal Church property.</p>
<p>South: by Hills subdivision, Ashland Pipe Line Co, Natchez-Adams County Higher Education Inc. property, Beltline Hwy, St. Catherine Creek, Spanish Bayou, Point Plantation Crossroad, Southside subdivision, Dunkerron subdivision, Lower Woodville Road, Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills subdivision, Gloucester tract, Flora Merry Estate and Cargill Road.</p>
<p>West: by Old Providence Road, Lewis Road, original lower city limits of Natchez and live thalweg of the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements to be considered:<br />&bull; Safety: safety characteristics of the proposed space such as fire safety, structural safety of the building, presence of environmental contaminates and other safety related factors that affect employees and visitors;<br />&bull; Location: proximity to the center of producer activity, accessibility to primary, hard-surfaced roads, and the suitability of the location for a County Office;<br />&bull; Quality/Physical Characteristics: quality of building design, materials, maintenance, ground maintenance.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>&bull; Building name and address and location of the available space within the building;<br />&bull; Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced, must indicate whether or not the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any;<br />&bull; Date of space availability;<br />&bull; Method of rentable space measurement;<br />&bull; Building ownership information;<br />&bull; Amount of parking available on-site and its costs; include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of required Government parking.<br />&bull; Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building;<br />&bull; List of building services provided.<br />The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.</p>

<p>Background checks as outlined below shall be accomplished prior to the first day of&nbsp;performance. Background checks shall be accomplished at no additional cost to the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;GENERAL</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has determined that performance of the tasks as described in this future award requires that the Contractor, subcontractor(s), vendor(s), etc. (herein known as Contractor) have access to sensitive DHS information, and that the Contractor will adhere to the following.</p>
<p>SUITABILITY DETERMINATION</p>
<p>DHS shall have and exercise full control over granting, denying, withholding or<br />terminating unescorted government facility and/or sensitive Government information access for Contractor employees, based upon the results of a background investigation. DHS may, as it deems appropriate, authorize and make a favorable entry on duty (EOD) decision based on preliminary security checks. The favorable EOD decision would allow the employees to commence work temporarily prior to the completion of the full investigation. The granting of a favorable EOD decision shall not be considered as assurance that a full employment suitability authorization will follow as a result thereof.<br />The granting of a favorable EOD decision or a full employment suitability determination shall in no way prevent, preclude, or bar the withdrawal or termination of any such access by DHS, at any time during the term of the contract. No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed to EOD and/or access sensitive information or systems without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the Office of Professional Responsibility, Personnel Security Unit (OPR-PSU). No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed unescorted access to a Government facility without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the OPR-PSU. Contract employees assigned to the contract<br />not needing access to sensitive DHS information or recurring access to DHS' facilities will not be subject to security suitability screening.</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS</p>
<p>Contract employees (to include applicants, temporaries, part-time and replacement employees) under the contract, needing access to sensitive information, shall undergo a position sensitivity analysis based on the duties each individual will perform on the contract. The results of the position sensitivity analysis shall identify the appropriate background investigation to be conducted. Background investigations will be processed through the Personnel Security Unit. Prospective Contractor employees with adequate<br />security clearances issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) may not be required to submit complete security packages, as the clearance issued by DISCO may be accepted. Prospective Contactor employees without adequate security clearances issued by DISCO shall submit the following completed forms to the Personnel Security Unit through the COTR, no less than 5 days before the starting date of the contract or 5 days prior to the expected entry on duty of any employees, whether a replacement, addition, subcontractor employee, or vendor:</p>
<p>1. Standard Form 85P, "Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions" Form will be<br />submitted via e-QIP (electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing)<br />(2 copies)</p>
<p>2. FD Form 258, "Fingerprint Card" (2 copies)</p>
<p>3. Foreign National Relatives or Associates Statement</p>
<p>4. DHS 11000-9, "Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports<br />Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act"</p>
<p>5. Optional Form 306, "Declaration for Federal Employment" (applies to<br />contractors as well)</p>
<p>6. Authorization for Release of Medical Information</p>
<p>Required forms will be provided by DHS at the time of award of the contract. Only complete packages will be accepted by the OPR-PSU. Specific instructions on submission of packages will be provided upon award of contract.<br /><br />Be advised that unless an applicant requiring access to sensitive information has resided in the US for the past three of the past five years, the Government may not be able to complete a satisfactory background investigation. In such cases, DHS retains the right to deem an applicant as ineligible due to insufficient background information.</p>
<p>The use of Non-U.S. citizens, including Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), is not permitted in the performance of this contract for any position that involves access to, development of/or maintenance to any DHS IT system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;CONTINUED ELIGIBILITY</p>
<p>If a prospective employee is found to be ineligible for access to Government facilities or information, the COTR will advise the Contractor that the employee shall not continue to work or to be assigned to work under the contract.</p>
<p>The OPR-PSU may require drug screening for probable cause at any time and/or when the contractor independently identifies circumstances where probable cause exists.</p>
<p>The OPR-PSU may require reinvestigations when derogatory information is received and/or every 5 years.</p>
<p>DHS reserves the right and prerogative to deny and/or restrict the facility and information access of any Contractor employee whose actions are in conflict with the standards of conduct, 5 CFR 2635 and 5 CFR 3801, or whom DHS determines to present a risk of compromising sensitive Government information to which he or she would have access under this contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor will report any adverse information coming to their attention concerning contract employees under the contract to the OPR-PSU through the COTR. Reports based on rumor or innuendo should not be made. The subsequent termination of employment of an employee does not obviate the requirement to submit this report. The report shall include the employee's name and social security number, along with the adverse information being reported.</p>
<p>The OPR-PSU must be notified of all terminations/resignations within five days of occurrence. The Contractor will return any expired DHS issued identification cards and building passes or those of terminated employees to the COTR. If an identification card or building pass is not available to be returned; a report must be submitted to the COTR, referencing the pass or card number, name of individual to whom issued, the last known location and disposition of the pass or card. The COTR will return the identification cards and building passes to the responsible ID Unit.</p>
<p>SECURITY MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>The Contractor shall appoint a senior official to act as the Corporate Security Officer. The individual will interface with the OPR-PSU through the COTR on all security matters, to include physical, personnel, and protection of all Government information and data accessed by the Contractor.</p>
<p>The COTR and the OPR-PSU shall have the right to inspect the procedures, methods, and facilities utilized by the Contractor in complying with the security requirements under this contract. Should the COTR determine that the Contractor is not complying with the security requirements of this contract; the Contractor will be informed in writing by the Contracting Officer of the proper action to be taken in order to effect compliance with such requirements.<br /><br />CLAUSES AND PROVISIONS: The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:<br /><br />Vendors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Vendor Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with its quote, as required.<br /><br />FAR 52.252-2 CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (Feb 98) <br />This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference with the same force and effect as if they were given in their full text.

<p>(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.</p>
<p>(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 66 months.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>Economic Price Adjustment for Gasoline: The awarded prices for the option period line items, if exercised, shall be adjusted for increases/decreases in gasoline prices at time of exercise.</p>
<p>(a) To the extent that contract cost increases/decreases are provided for by this economic price adjustment clause, the vendor warrants that the prices in this proposal for any option periods do not include any amount to protect against such contingent cost increases (no increases for gasoline prices included in the option periods).</p>
<p>(b) The cost index, for the purpose of price adjustment under this clause, shall be the American Automobile Association (AAA) Daily Fuel Gauge Report, Current Price per Gallon for Honolulu, Hawaii, unleaded regular, available at http://www.fuelgaugereport.com, as of April 12, 2010<br />(1) The Base Index, for the purposes of price adjustment under this clause, shall be $3.50, the most recent index published prior to the issue of this solicitation (rounded .5 and up, to the next higher number). This Base Index shall remain constant throughout the life of the contract, including all options.</p>
<p>(2) The Adjusting Index shall be the most recent Index published on the date the Government provides the contractor preliminary written notice of its intent to exercise an option period. In the AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report Current Price per Gallon for Honolulu, Hawaii, Gasoline, unleaded regular discontinues, or alters substantially, its method of calculating the Index cited herein, the parties shall mutually agree upon an appropriate substitute for determining the price adjustment described herein.</p>
<p>(c) In preparation for exercise of an option period, the Contracting Officer shall apply the difference between the Base Index and the Adjusting Index to the option year prices by multiplying the increase/decrease times the number of gallons identified for each line item. Only the line items of the option year being exercised will be adjusted.</p>
<p>(d) An example of an adjustment calculation is provided below for informational purposes only.<br />For purposes of this example, assume that the contract price for the option period being exercised $2,000.00 per month, and includes costs for 200 gallons of gasoline. If the Base Index (the most recent index published prior to the issue of this solicitation) is $3.50 per gallon and Adjustment Index (the most recent Index published on the date the Government provides the contractor preliminary written notice of its intent to exercise an option period) is $3.65 per gallon, the calculations for contract price adjustment would be as follows:</p>
<p>Adjusting Index $3.65 per gallon</p>
<p>Minus the Base Index -$3.50 per gallon<br />Equals increase (or decrease) to the Base Index <br />$ .15 increase<br /><br />Option Line Item gasoline quantity multiplied by increase (or decrease) 200 * .15 = $30.00</p>
<p>Option Line Item price adjusted by increase ( or decrease) $2,000.00 + $30.00 = $2,030.00</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

The solicitation number is NHLBI-PB-(HG)-2010-174-DLM and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). 

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-41 (May 13, 2010).

Period of Performance:  The proposed performance for this service will consist on a one year contract period. (July 1, 2010  June 30, 2011)

The estimated level of effort is 3700 direct labor hours.

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 622110 and the business size standard is $34.5M. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) on behalf of The NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) and the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Disease program (TRND) of the National Human Genome Research Institute to negotiate and award an order to Yale University School of Medicine, P.O. Box 208047, 47 College Street, Suite 203, New Haven, CT 06520-8047 for assaying of compounds in multiple assays associated with Anti-Hookworm activity.

The sole source determination is based on the fact the National Institute of Health (NIH)  is the nations medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives.  The NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) and the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Disease program (TRND) of the National Human Genome Research Institute has developed an oxadiazole-2-oxide class of compounds identified agents capable of killing the hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum in both ex vivo and in vivo models.  To continue to further our understanding of the structure activity relationships surrounding this class of compounds and establish a mechanistic link between the NO (Nitric Oxide) donation by these agents and the down-regulation of key reductases in both species.  One of the key goals is for the research results to be used as the basis for the filing of an investigational new drug application (IND) for phase 0/1 clinical evaluation of advanced agent(s) as a therapy by NCGC and/or TRND.  Therefore, TRND needs the following tasks to be carried out by the Contractor: 1) synthesize newer analogues of this molecule 2) examine selected pharmacokinetic properties of these agents (including plasma and microsomal stability and the ability of these agents to cross membranes) 3) additional testing of these agents anti-hookworm properties including the assaying of compounds for NO donation, for ex vivo worm killing, a pulse worm killing assay, LD50 determinations, worm killing in plasma shift environments, and in vivo worm clearance assays.    

The NIH Chemical Genomics Center and the NIH Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases laboratories (referred to as NCGC and TRND, respectively) have discovered agents capable of inhibiting thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR), a reductase required by the parasites causing schistosomiasis and other helminth parasites to maintain proper cellular redox balance.  Gratifyingly, these agents are capable of inhibiting this enzyme and have subsequently been found to be active anti-schistosomal and anti-hookworm agents in both ex vivo and in vivo models. 

Starting in July of 2010 TRND will initiate a comprehensive effort to expand on these discoveries in order to develop small molecule therapeutics for Hookworm infection either as a single agent or in combination with albendazole.   

The administration of this contract will be responsible for the accurate and timely of all data in regards to activities only as requested and directed by the TRND Project Officer and may not conduct work on the contract without receiving advanced approval from TRND.  The decision of which animal species to be used and any requirements for specific pathogen free (SPF) animals shall be made jointly by the TRND and concerns scientific leadership with TRND having final approval authority.  The Contractor will use state-of-the-art techniques and technologies in evaluating promising therapeutics and will incorporate new and improved techniques and technologies into the contract activities

The objective of this agreement is to establish a set of mutually agreeable research parameters and anticipated contract terms all of which can be incorporated into a future fee-for-service contract executed between the qualified agencys and/or small business concerns and TRND.  Under this contract the Contractor will be responsible for all analyses associated with novel small molecules versus the hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum. There is compelling data that suggests that these agents would be appropriate for clinical use and the primary purpose of this contract is to assess new small molecules versus a battery of tests associated with anti-hookworm activity.  

The major functions to be carried out by this contract are:

-- Assaying of compounds for pulse worm killing assay	
-- Assaying of compounds for LD50 determinations	
-- Assaying of compounds for worm killing in plasma shift	
-- Assaying of compounds for in vivo worm clearance assays	
-- Assaying of compounds for pulse mediated in vivo worm clearance assays	
-- Analysis of compounds for animal GI effects	
-- Analysis of plasma for exposure to compound 	

All data associated with this program will be handled and disseminate in accordance to guidelines set by the TRND Project Officer.  The Contractor may not disseminate data associated with this project without receiving advanced approval from TRND.  

-- The Contractor shall conduct an assessment the quality of all assays and submit data in a timely fashion.
--  No data will be sent without the minimal amount of quality requirements that meet the accepted standards for advancement of the project as determined by the TRND staff.	
-- The Contractor shall identify the biological techniques that are not previously recorded in the published literature and forward such methods and record all alterations to experimental procedures.
-- The primary task is the determination of activities of new compounds in all assays and timely delivery of this data.  
-- The Contractor shall provide the both final data and raw data.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 15, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Office of the Director (OD), and the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) intends to procure professional services on a sole source basis from the New England Research Institutes. The period of performance shall be from date of award through August 31, 2011. The resultant award will be a cost-reimbursement contract. <br />
<p><strong><br />1. Background Information</strong><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is comprised of the Office of the Director (OD) and 27 Institutes and Centers. The Office of the Director is the central office at NIH. The OD is responsible for setting policy for NIH and for planning, managing, and coordinating the programs and activities of all the NIH components.</p>
<p>The NIH Director provides overall leadership to NIH activities in both scientific and administrative matters. Although each institute within the NIH has a separate mission, the NIH Director plays an active role in shaping the agency's research agenda and outlook. With a unique and critical perspective on the mission of the entire NIH, the Director is responsible for providing leadership to the institutes for identifying needs and opportunities, especially for efforts that involve several institutes. The NIH Director is assisted by the Principal Deputy Director, who shares in the overall direction of the agency's activities.</p>
<p>In carrying out these responsibilities, the NIH Director stays informed about program priorities and accomplishments through regular staff meetings, discussions, and briefing sessions with OD and institute staff. The Director also receives input from: <br />&bull; the extramural scientific community, including both individual researchers and scientific organizations <br />&bull; patient advocacy and voluntary health groups that deal directly with NIH or indirectly through Congress and the media <br />&bull; the Congress and the Administration the Council of Public Representatives, which brings public views to NIH.</p>
<p>Ongoing discussions with these groups and others provide the basis for an established framework within which priorities for the agency are identified, reviewed, and justified. <br /><br />The Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) opened officially on July 1, 1995. The U.S. Congress established OBSSR in the National Institutes of Health, Office of the Director, in recognition of the key role that behavioral and social factors often play in illness and health. The OBSSR mission is to stimulate behavioral and social sciences research throughout NIH and to integrate these areas of research more fully into others of the NIH health research enterprise, thereby improving our understanding, treatment, and prevention of disease. To provide the OBSSR with counsel in fulfilling its mission, the Behavioral and Social Sciences Research Coordinating Committee (BSSRCC) serves as an internal advisory board.<br /><br />OBSSR's mission is to:<br />&bull; provide leadership and direction in the development, refinement, and implementation of a trans-NIH plan to increase the scope of and support for behavioral and social sciences research;<br />&bull; inform and advise the NIH director and other key officials of trends and developments having significant bearing on the missions of the NIH, DHHS, and other federal agencies;<br />&bull; serve as the principal NIH spokesperson regarding research on the importance of behavioral, social, and lifestyle factors in the causation, treatment, and prevention of diseases; and to advise and consult on these topics with NIH scientists and others within and outside the federal government;<br />&bull; develop a standard definition of "behavioral and social sciences research," assess the current levels of NIH support for this research, and develop an overall strategy for the uniform expansion and integration of these disciplines across NIH institutes and centers;<br />&bull; develop initiatives designed to stimulate research in the behavioral and social sciences arena, integrate a bio-behavioral perspective across the research areas of the NIH, and encourage the study of behavioral and social sciences across NIH's institutes and centers;<br />&bull; initiate and promote studies to evaluate the contributions of behavioral, social, and lifestyle determinants in the development, course, treatment, and prevention of illness and related public health problems;<br />&bull; provide leadership in ensuring that findings from behavioral and social sciences research are disseminated to the public; and to<br />&bull; sponsor seminars, symposia, workshops, and conferences at the NIH and at national and international scientific meetings on state-of-the-art behavioral and social sciences research.</p>
<p>On March 29, 2006 the New England Research Institute (NERI) submitted an unsolicited contract proposal to OBSSR/OD for the purpose of a Web-based textbook on research methods in the behavioral and social sciences relevant to research on health. In early 2007, after conducting a review of the proposal, OBSSR through the National Library of Medicine (NLM/NIH) contracted with NERI for the proposed project, <em>Advancing Behavioral and Social Sciences Research through Interactive Learning</em>. NERI has completed this project and published the product at <a href="http://www.esourceresearch.org">http://www.esourceresearch.org</a>.</p>
<p>Since the development and online publication, the web-based course has been well received by the scientific community. NERI and OBSSR have received requests for additional features. Among these are (1) the ability to print out paper copies or save electronic (PDF) copies of the chapters, (2) the opportunity to post questions and engage in dialogue with other researchers about the course materials, and (3) the addition of hyperlinks to reputable resources regarding research methods in the behavioral and social sciences.</p>
<p>NERI and OBSSR have received requests for additional features.

Objectives</strong><br />OBSSR desires that NERI maintain the site in order to assure proper functioning of the electronic course, make corrections to any emerging technical and content problems, and to add features enhancing the utility and value of the course to the NIH and the scientific public.</p>
<p><strong>3. Tasks and Deliverables</strong><br />&bull; Conduct maintenance of the previously developed Internet site, eSource (http://www.eSourceresearch.org), consisting of monitoring the site's functioning, correcting programming malfunctions, providing technical assistance to users, as well as editing and updating content (e.g., correcting errors, clarifying the meaning of content).<br />&bull; Add new features to the Internet site:</p>
<p>(1) <em>Chat</em> capabilities to permit users to post messages to the Web Master that may be used, for example, to identify functional problems, assess usability of the site, receive recommendations for new content or features to improve the site.<br />(2) <em>Print function</em> to enable the downloading of PDF files and/or printing of chapters.<br />(3) <em>Links</em> to/from other reputable resources in the methods of behavioral and social science research.</p>
<p><strong>Sole Source Justification</strong><br />The New England Research Institute (NERI) prepared and tested a Web-based interactive textbook for state-of-the-art science research methods in the behavioral and social sciences (BSS). The continued success of this project depends on the contractor developing, maintaining, publishing, augmenting, where necessary, the Internet website. NERI coordinated the creation of the textbook content for the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) and translated this information into innovative and interesting Web products for the extramural research community engaged in health-related behavioral and social sciences at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research. NERI has the expertise and resources to maintain and enhance the site. Transferring this project to another contractor will compromise NERI's proprietary information as well as impede the continuity of the requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance</strong><br />The period of performance shall be from date of award through August 31, 2011.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 39.2, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act is implemented in this order. Pursuant to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, all electronic and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, and/or used under this contract/order must comply with the "Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions" set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in 36 CFR part 1194. Information about Section 508 provisions is available at http://www.hhs.gov/od . The complete text of Section 508 Final provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/provisions.htm.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is a RFP available; however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM. Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the referenced service as specified above. Responses must be in writing and must be received electronically at the Government infrastructure by 4:00 PM EST on Wednesday, June 2, 2010. Proposals must include pricing information and should reference Synopsis No. NLM-10-129/SRE and should be submitted to sheila.edmonds@nih.gov. Inquiries regarding this procurement shall be submitted electronically to sheila.edmonds@nih.gov and shall be received by 12:00 PM EST on Wednesday, May 26, 2010.</p>

The following NAVSUP Clause reference Contractor Access is incorporated in full text: 
SUP 5252.204-9400 Contractor Access to Federally Controlled Facilities and/or Unclassified Sensitive Information or Unclassified IT Systems (May 2010) 
Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors.  The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12.  This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.  This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform certain unclassified both non-sensitive and sensitive duties.  It is the responsibility of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.    The requirement to control access to sensitive information applies to all US government IT systems and/or areas where unclassified but sensitive information may be discussed, displayed or maintained.  DON policy prescribes that all unclassified data that has not been approved for public release and is stored on mobile computing devises must be treated as sensitive data and encrypted using commercially available encryption technology. Whenever granted access to sensitive information, contractor employees shall follow applicable DoD/DoN instructions, regulations, policies and procedures when reviewing, processing, producing, protecting, destroying and/or storing that information.  Operational Security (OPSEC) procedures and practices must be implemented by both the contractor and contract employee to protect the product, information, services, operations and missions related to the contract. The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative.  Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the Navy Command's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative.  The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter.  The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer.  
Non-Sensitive PositionsContractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements: 
.	Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the US (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and .	Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) fingerprint check prior to installation access.  
To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor's Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following: 
.	SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions.	Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards.	Original Signed Release Statements
The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed NACI.  
The Contractor's Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required.  Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.   Sensitive Positions Contractor employee whose duties require accessing a DoD unclassified computer/network, working with sensitive unclassified information (either at a Government or contractor facility), or physical access to a DoD facility must be a US citizen and possess a favorable trustworthiness determination prior to installation access.  To obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination, each contractor employee must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Local Credit Checks (NACLC) which consists of a NACI including a FBI fingerprint check plus credit and law enforcement checks. Each contractor employee applying for a trustworthiness determination is required to complete:
.	SF-85P Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions.	Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards.	Original Signed Release Statements 
Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.  To maintain continuing authorization for an employee to access a DoD unclassified computer/network, and/or have access to sensitive unclassified information, the contractor shall ensure that the individual employee has a current requisite background investigation.  The Contractor's Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required and ensuring that background investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period.
IT Systems AccessWhen access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.  Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources.  The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date.  Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.      When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation.  The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.  
Security Approval ProcessThe Contractor's Security Representative shall ensure that each individual employee pending assignment shall accurately complete the required forms for submission to the Navy Command's Security Manager.  The Contractor's Security Representative shall screen the investigative questionnaires for completeness and accuracy and for potential suitability/security issues prior to submitting the request to the Navy Command's Security Manager.  Forms and fingerprint cards may be obtained from the Navy Command's Security Manager.  These required items, shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager for processing at least 30 days prior to the individual employee's anticipated date for reporting for duty.  The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy Command's Security Manager may render the contract employee ineligible for the assignment.  A favorable review of the questionnaire and advance fingerprint results are required as an interim measure prior to the contract employee start date.  An unfavorable determination made by the Navy Command's Security Manager is final and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract.If contractor employees already possess a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the Navy Command's Security Manager will use the Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS).  The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR.  The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract. 
The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing.  Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a position of trust determination.  When a favorable determination is not made, contractor employees shall not be permitted to work on this contract effort and if already working on the contract shall be removed immediately.  
The potential consequences of any requirements under this clause including denial of access for a proposed contractor employee who fails to obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract.  Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees for working in non-sensitive positions, with sensitive information, and/or on Government IT systems.  The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have physical access to a federally controlled facility and/or access to a federally-controlled information system/network and/or access to government information.

Any questions with regard to this requirement shall be addresses to the Purchasing Agent/Contract Specialist identified elsewhere on the solicitation/award document.USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM - STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 
(1) The offeror's past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable. This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System - Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services. 
(2) The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems. PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3) Quality: The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier's past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC). Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier's overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class. The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1. Dark Blue: Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2. Purple: Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3. Green: Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4. Yellow: Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5. Red: Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4) Delivery: Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier's percentage of on time deliveries. On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5) PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/. Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications. Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov. The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6) Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

            WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
be:

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
   a wage determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
and 3.) should be followed.

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process described here, initial contact should be with the
Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage
payment data, project description, area practice material,
etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, appliesto this acquisition.9.   The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, will not beused.  The following clause will be used to evaluate proposals.M-307  EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD (BEST VALUE)(a) The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to thatresponsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation, is determinedtoprovide the "best value" to the Government.  Such offer may not necessarily bethe proposal offering the lowest cost or receiving the highest technical rating.(b) Proposals will be rated and ranked on the evaluation factors listed below.It should be noted that cost is not a numerically weighted factor.  Althoughtechnical factors are significantly more important than cost, cost is animportantfactor and should be considered when preparing responsive proposals. Theimportance of cost as an evaluation factor will increase with the degree ofequality of the proposals in relation to the remaining evaluation factors.Whenthe offerors within the competitive range are considered essentially equal interms of technical capability, or when cost is so significantly high as todiminishthe value of the technical superiority to the government, cost may become thedetermining factor for award.  In summary, cost/technical trade-offs will bemade, and the extent to which one may be sacrificed for the other is governedonly by the tests of rationality and consistency with the establishedevaluationfactors.Factor 1 and Factor 2 are of equal importance and are more importantindividually than Factor 3.Factor 1: RELEVANT CORPORATE  EXPERIENCE.Factor 2: PAST PERFORMANCE.Factor 3:  ABILITY TO MEET CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS / SPECIFICATIONS.10.  Offerors shall include in their proposal a completed copy of the provisionat 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items,with its offer.  A copy of 52.212-3 is included as Attachment 2 to thissolicitation.11.  The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- CommercialItems, applies to this acquisition and is included in this solicitation..12. The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required ToImplement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items, applies to thisacquisition.  Additional FAR clauses cited in the clause are included as anattachment to this solicitation.13.  Additional Information:The full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) may be accessed at:http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.Offerors shall submit a price for each CLIN in paragraph  5 above based on thenine milestones described in paragraph 7 above.L-324  INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF TECHNICAL PROPOSALS(a) The technical proposal shall cover your understanding of the work and yourmethod to attain contract objectives.  The technical approach shall enabletechnical personnel to make a thorough evaluation and a determination as towhether the product proposed and described will satisfy the requirements of thegovernment.  The technical proposal shall be specific, detailed and completeand fully demonstrate that the prospective offeror has a thoroughunderstanding of the government's requirements.  Statements that theprospective offeror understands, can or will comply with all specifications,statements paraphrasing the specifications or parts thereof, and phrases suchas "standard procedures will be employed" or "well known techniques will beused," etc., will be considered insufficient.(b) Specifically, the following information should be included in yourtechnicalproposal:Factor 1: RELEVANT CORPORATE  EXPERIENCE:The offeror shall provide  3  descriptions of relevant projects worked on inthepast 10 years that are of similar structural size and also included sea towing.Factor 2: PAST PERFORMANCE:The offeror shall provide 3 contact references for projects worked on in thepast10 years.Factor 3:  ABILITY TO MEET CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS / SPECIFICATIONS:The offeror shall submit a project plan, similar to a business plan, detailingtheprocess either planned or in place for the project that will confirm allcriticalrequirements and specifications listed in the Statement of Work (SOW) will bemet.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:<br />(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement;<br />(ii) price<br />Basis for award: The award will be made to the vendor whose quotation represents the best value to the government. As allowed by FAR 13.106-2(b)(1), the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) selection process shall be applied. Award will be made to the vendor who is deemed responsible and responsive, and represents the best value to the Government based on selection of the technically acceptable quotation with the lowest evaluated price. The best value is represented by the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation. To be eligible for award, a quotation must meet all technical requirements, conform to all required terms and conditions, and provide all information required. The technical area will be evaluated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis. Only those quotations determined to be technically acceptable will be evaluated on price. If the quotation received is determined to be unacceptable, the vendor will be excluded from competition and will not be considered for award.<br />(b) Reserved<br />(c) A purchase order, mailed or otherwise furnished to the vendor shall result in a binding contract upon receipt of written acknowlegement by the vendor or commencement of performance.<br />________________________________________________________________________<br />NOTE: In accordance with FAR 13.004, the following information regarding quotations is provided:<br />Legal Effect of Quotations<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.</p>
<p>In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. <br />CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010) <br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- <br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- <br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ] , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); <br />(C) Are / are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have [ ] have not [ ] within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(End of provision)<br />52.209-7 Information Regarding Responsibility Matters. <br />INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010) <br />(a) Definitions.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) 0 Are, 0 are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) 0 Have, 0 have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) 0 Are, 0 are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) 0 Have, 0 have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695. <br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 28 MAY 2010, 10:00 a.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 28 MAY 2010.

No solicitation will be available. The draft BOA and the BOA submittal requirements are posted on FED BIZ OPPS in conjunction with this announcement. The United States Coast Guard Civil Engineering Unit Oakland is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) firms serviced by SBA District Offices in Washington, Oregon, and California, and other 8(a) participants with SBA recognized bona-fide places of business in Washington, Oregon, and California to participate in a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) Pilot Program. BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U.S. Small Business Administration. The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the US Coast Guard, Civil Engineering Unit (CEU) Oakland, and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of construction services, if and when ordered. The BOA contains contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to all task orders issued under the BOA according to the dollar amount of each task order. Annually, CEU Oakland will review the continued need for the BOA in light of (a) usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program for new entrants once a year. Under the BOA 8(a) firms compete on task orders for construction and construction related service requirements pursuant to the BOA. General contractors are preferred, but specialty contractors will be considered as well. Individual projects will be solicited and awarded if and when required. CEU Oakland gives no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Coast Guard to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Coast Guard solicit and acquire covered services from that contractor only. The anticipated construction work may require a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. The anticipated construction work to be covered under the BOAs include, but is not limited to, new construction, minor construction projects [exterior and interior renovations, alterations, repairs (emergency and routine)], handling of hazardous waste and material, maintenance, mechanical, electrical, heating/air conditioning, painting, paving, earthwork, demolition, installing pipelines, and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls only).

Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly. The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. Either party may cancel the agreement with 60 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on task orders issued prior to the effective date of cancellation.</p>
<p>SOLICITATIONS: Each project solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror, and evaluation criteria and the basis for award to be used for each project. The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, may consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price. If the award basis will be on price alone, the Contractor may be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000. CEU Oakland will require Payment Bonds on each Task order over $25,000 and Performance Bonds on task orders over $100,000. The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time.</p>
<p>ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded using the Optional Form 347 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract.</p>
<p>LIMITATION OF ORDERS: The range will be from $3,000 to a maximum of $3,000,000. Firms must demonstrate they meet the qualifications to receive a BOA.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country&rsquo;s political process.</span></p>

The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.<BR>HQ Army Material Command<BR>Office of Command Counsel<BR>9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401<BR>Ft.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />GENERAL<br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has determined that performance of the tasks as described in this future award requires that the Contractor, subcontractor(s), vendor(s), etc. (herein known as Contractor) have access to sensitive DHS information, and that the Contractor will adhere to the following.</p>
<p>SUITABILITY DETERMINATION<br />DHS shall have and exercise full control over granting, denying, withholding or terminating unescorted government facility and/or sensitive Government information access for Contractor employees, based upon the results of a background investigation. DHS may, as it deems appropriate, authorize and make a favorable entry on duty (EOD) decision based on preliminary security checks. The favorable EOD decision would allow the employees to commence work temporarily prior to the completion of the full investigation. The granting of a favorable EOD decision shall not be considered as assurance that a full employment suitability authorization will follow as a result thereof. The granting of a favorable EOD decision or a full employment suitability determination shall in no way prevent, preclude, or bar the withdrawal or termination of any such access by DHS, at any time during the term of the contract. No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed to EOD and/or access sensitive information or systems without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the Office of Professional Responsibility, Personnel Security Unit (OPR-PSU). No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed unescorted access to a Government facility without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the OPR-PSU. Contract employees assigned to the contract not needing access to sensitive DHS information or recurring access to DHS' facilities will not be subject to security suitability screening.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS<br />Contract employees (to include applicants, temporaries, part-time and replacement employees) under the contract, needing access to sensitive information, shall undergo a position sensitivity analysis based on the duties each individual will perform on the contract. The results of the position sensitivity analysis shall identify the appropriate background investigation to be conducted. Background investigations will be processed through the Personnel Security Unit. Prospective Contractor employees with adequate security clearances issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) may not be required to submit complete security packages, as the clearance issued by DISCO may be accepted. Prospective Contactor employees without adequate security clearances issued by DISCO shall submit the following completed forms to the Personnel Security Unit through the COTR, no less than 5 days before the starting date of the contract or 5 days prior to the expected entry on duty of any employees, whether a replacement, addition, subcontractor employee, or vendor:</p>
<p>1. Standard Form 85P, "Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions" Form will be submitted via e-QIP (electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing)<br />(2 copies)</p>
<p>2. FD Form 258, "Fingerprint Card" (2 copies)</p>
<p>3. Foreign National Relatives or Associates Statement</p>
<p>4. DHS 11000-9, "Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act"</p>
<p>5. Optional Form 306, "Declaration for Federal Employment" (applies to contractors as well)</p>
<p>6. Authorization for Release of Medical Information</p>
<p>Required forms will be provided by DHS at the time of award of the contract. Only complete packages will be accepted by the OPR-PSU. Specific instructions on submission of packages will be provided upon award of contract.</p>
<p>Be advised that unless an applicant requiring access to sensitive information has resided in the US for the past three of the past five years, the Government may not be able to complete a satisfactory background investigation. In such cases, DHS retains the right to deem an applicant as ineligible due to insufficient background information.</p>
<p>The use of Non-U.S. citizens, including Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), is not permitted in the performance of this contract for any position that involves access to, development of, or maintenance to any DHS IT system.</p>
<p>CONTINUED ELIGIBILITY<br />If a prospective employee is found to be ineligible for access to Government facilities or information, the COTR will advise the Contractor that the employee shall not continue to work or to be assigned to work under the contract.</p>
<p>The OPR-PSU may require drug screening for probable cause at any time and/or when the contractor independently identifies circumstances where probable cause exists.</p>
<p>The OPR-PSU may require reinvestigations when derogatory information is received and/or every 5 years.</p>
<p>DHS reserves the right and prerogative to deny and/or restrict the facility and information access of any Contractor employee whose actions are in conflict with the standards of conduct, 5 CFR 2635 and 5 CFR 3801, or whom DHS determines to present a risk of compromising sensitive Government information to which he or she would have access under this contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor will report any adverse information coming to their attention concerning contract employees under the contract to the OPR-PSU through the COTR. Reports based on rumor or innuendo should not be made. The subsequent termination of employment of an employee does not obviate the requirement to submit this report. The report shall include the employee's name and social security number, along with the adverse information being reported.</p>
<p>The OPR-PSU must be notified of all terminations/resignations within five days of occurrence. The Contractor will return any expired DHS issued identification cards and building passes, or those of terminated employees to the COTR. If an identification card or building pass is not available to be returned, a report must be submitted to the COTR, referencing the pass or card number, name of individual to whom issued, the last known location and disposition of the pass or card. The COTR will return the identification cards and building passes to the responsible ID Unit.</p>
<p>SECURITY MANAGEMENT<br />The Contractor shall appoint a senior official to act as the Corporate Security Officer. The individual will interface with the OPR-PSU through the COTR on all security matters, to include physical, personnel, and protection of all Government information and data accessed by the Contractor.</p>
<p>The COTR and the OPR-PSU shall have the right to inspect the procedures, methods, and facilities utilized by the Contractor in complying with the security requirements under this contract. Should the COTR determine that the Contractor is not complying with the security requirements of this contract; the Contractor will be informed in writing by the Contracting Officer of the proper action to be taken in order to effect compliance with such requirements.</p>

<p>This Statement is for Information Only:<br />It is not a Wage Determination<br />Employee Class Monetary Wage -- Fringe Benefits<br />Driver Courier $20.37 - $3.35<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>52.217-5 -- Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990)<br />Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206<br />(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999)<br />The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 calendar days before the contract expires.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000)</p>
<p>(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 calendar days before the contract expires; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.</p>
<p>(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.</p>
<p>(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 66 months.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>Economic Price Adjustment for Gasoline: The awarded prices for the option period line items, if exercised, shall be adjusted for increases/decreases in gasoline prices at time of exercise.</p>
<p>(a) To the extent that contract cost increases/decreases are provided for by this economic price adjustment clause, the vendor warrants that the prices in this proposal for any option periods do not include any amount to protect against such contingent cost increases (no increases for gasoline prices included in the option periods).</p>
<p>(b) The cost index, for the purpose of price adjustment under this clause, shall be the American Automobile Association (AAA) Daily Fuel Gauge Report, Current Price per Gallon for Honolulu, Hawaii, unleaded regular, available at http://www.fuelgaugereport.com, as of April 12, 2010<br />(1) The Base Index, for the purposes of price adjustment under this clause, shall be $3.50, the most recent index published prior to the issue of this solicitation (rounded .5 and up, to the next higher number). This Base Index shall remain constant throughout the life of the contract, including all options.</p>
<p>(2) The Adjusting Index shall be the most recent Index published on the date the Government provides the contractor preliminary written notice of its intent to exercise an option period. In the AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report Current Price per Gallon for Honolulu, Hawaii, Gasoline, unleaded regular discontinues, or alters substantially, its method of calculating the Index cited herein, the parties shall mutually agree upon an appropriate substitute for determining the price adjustment described herein.</p>
<p>(c) In preparation for exercise of an option period, the Contracting Officer shall apply the difference between the Base Index and the Adjusting Index to the option year prices by multiplying the increase/decrease times the number of gallons identified for each line item. Only the line items of the option year being exercised will be adjusted.</p>
<p>(d) An example of an adjustment calculation is provided below for informational purposes only.<br />For purposes of this example, assume that the contract price for the option period being exercised $2,000.00 per month, and includes costs for 200 gallons of gasoline. If the Base Index (the most recent index published prior to the issue of this solicitation) is $3.50 per gallon and Adjustment Index (the most recent Index published on the date the Government provides the contractor preliminary written notice of its intent to exercise an option period) is $3.65 per gallon, the calculations for contract price adjustment would be as follows:</p>
<p>Adjusting Index $3.65 per gallon</p>
<p>Minus the Base Index -$3.50 per gallon<br />Equals increase (or decrease) to the Base Index <br />$ .15 increase<br /><br />Option Line Item gasoline quantity multiplied by increase (or decrease) 200 * .15 = $30.00</p>
<p>Option Line Item price adjusted by increase ( or decrease) $2,000.00 + $30.00 = $2,030.00</p>

<p>Reason: Inform offerors of annual new staff orientation held in the Fall of each year for new staff. This is a 2-day orientation. There is usually no need for contractors to budget for this orientation as it can usually be absorbed within the main contract budget. However, if offerors prefer to included a budget line item for this orientation it is fine to do so.</p>

The site comprises portions of the former country estate of Frederick and Louise Vanderbilt, known historically as Hyde Park.  The Vanderbilt house was built on a ridge overlooking the Hudson River in 1895-98 by McKim, Mead and White, one of the most important architectural firms in the history of the United States. A number of important decorators contributed to the house interiors, including Georges Glaenzer, Jules Allard, and Ogden Codman, in additional to Stanford White.  The interiors are richly appointed, fashionable rooms and are archetypes of the American Renaissance period.  All textiles that are the focus of this contract are original to the house and therefore of high associative and historic value.  
The site was designated a National Historic Site in 1940 under the direction of President--and native Hyde Park resident-- Franklin D. Roosevelt, and is currently managed jointly by the NPS with FDR's home and that of Eleanor Roosevelt.
Scope of WorkUPON AWARD OF CONTRACT, perform the following services:  
Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, materials, facilities and travel needed to eradicate pests in selected historic collections of the Vanderbilt house by exposure to an anoxic environment.  The selected Contractor shall:

With the exception of veggie sandwiches, is it permissible to omit these items on the sandwiches?<br /><span style="COLOR: blue"><br />Answer:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Yes it is permissible to omit these items on sandwiches.</span>
<p>2.&nbsp; An ice cart/cooler is required for the storage of ice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Will there be a need for a storage device for the sandwiches?</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: blue">Answer:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>No, there is not a need for a storage device for the sandwiches. They are distributed within a couple of hours of receipt.<br /></span><br />3.&nbsp; Can the beverages (juice and sports drink) be in cans versus bottles?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="COLOR: blue"><br />Answer:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>We would prefer bottles. I do not know of too many juices and/or sports drinks that come in cans.<br /></span><br />4.&nbsp; Can the beverages be delivered ALL at once on the 10th of July?<br /><span style="COLOR: blue"><br />Answer: No. We do not have enough storage space.<br /></span><br />5.&nbsp; Can the coffee be delivered ALL at once on the 6th of July?<br /><span style="COLOR: blue"><br />Answer: No. We do not have enough storage space.</span></p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will we have to separate the sandwiches by content type or will they have to be mixed per box (in the past we had to wait on daily headcount and then subdivide each box based upon the breakdown they gave us.<br /><span style="COLOR: blue"><br />Answer: We would prefer mixed per box. Either way is fine if it would cut costs. However, we will need to the contents identified in each box.<br /></span><br />7.&nbsp; Is there a minimum requirement for the bread thickness since it's one sandwich per person ( &frac34;" or &frac12;" minimum?)</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: blue">Answer:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is not a minimum requirement for bread thickness. It needs to be sufficient to make a decent sandwich and the contents must be fresh.</span></p>

<DESC><p>The following is an update to the information previously&nbsp;modified on April 6, 2010:&nbsp; <br /><br />The Dyess AFB (DAFB)&nbsp;Biomass Energy Plant project as&nbsp;stated below is still a bonafide requirement.&nbsp; It is the Government's intention to proceed forward with a RFP.&nbsp; However, we have determined that it is in the best interest of the Government and all interested parties to&nbsp;refrain from posting a solicitation at this time.&nbsp; We are currently awaiting the&nbsp;results of&nbsp;a&nbsp;required Environmental Assessment and&nbsp;are uncertain of the duration of the assessment at this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government&nbsp;appreciates&nbsp;your patience during this process and asks that you please continue to monitor FedBizOpps.gov for updated status on this project.<br /><br />As previously stated, this project calls for a utility contract (Power Purchase Agreement) for renewable energy (electricity) from a biomass energy plant. This plant will be contractor funded, designed, constructed, operated and maintained on&nbsp;DAFB under a utility service contract pursuant to FAR Part 41. The facility will be fueled from municipal solid waste and/or biomass that meet the requirements of The Energy Policy Act of 2005, section 203 (b)(1). The minimum size plant contemplated is 2 MW with a maximum determined by the offeror as a business decision.
<p>The objective of DAFB is to procure the renewable energy generated from the Plant at life cycle cost over an anticipated 20-25 year period. The expectation is that DAFB would pay lower costs than it does under its current pricing structure. The contractor may sell the Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) to a third party. The successful offeror's proposal will become part of the contract upon award. Award will be made to the lowest-price technically acceptable offer. In this context, price refers to the present value total estimated electricity costs over the life of the lease. The Air Force reserves the right not to make an award. The current DAFBs energy profile includes a base load of approximately 4 MW and a summertime peak load of approximately 13 MW. DAFB currently consumes approximately 65 million kWh per year.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237130, Power and Communication Line and Related Structures Construction. The solicitation will be issued electronically following the results of the Environmental Assessment via the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Paper copies will not be available. It is the responsibility of all interested parties to review the FBO website frequently for updates/amendments to any and all documents for the solicitation. All prospective offerors interested in submitting a proposal must be registered in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov) in order to be eligible for an award. The closing date, time for submission of offeror's, and site visit information will be contained in the solicitation package.</p>

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION HAS BEEN REOPENED AND WILL BE ADVERTISED UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION on April 21, 2010. 

THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS SOLICITATION IS BROUGHT FORWARD FROM PREVIOUS SOLICITATION NUMBER DTFH68-09-B-00036.

PROJECT DETAILS: The project is located within the Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge, which is adjacent to the City of Lawton, Oklahoma and the Fort Sill Army Base. 

This project consists of the placement of fills on both sides of an existing 2-mile asphalt paved road (Six Mile Scenic Road) to provide additional width, and the construction of paved shoulders along both sides of the road. A double 10-foot by 5-foot concrete box culvert will be extended in place to match the new widths, along with the construction of new headwalls and wingwalls. Other circular metal culverts along the route will need to be extended. In order to perform the widening, both edges of the existing pavment must be saw cut along most of the length. Also included in the project are the replacement of guardrails and guardrail end terminals, grouted riprap at the culvert extensions, and the replacement of permanent signs. After the widening and paved shoulders are completed, the entire roadway surface will be treated with a 3/8-inch modified slurry seal.

In addition to the road work described above, a prefabricated single span steel pedestrian bridge will be constructed at the Elk Mountain Campground area of the Refuge. Other work associated with the bridge construction includes the removal of an existing small pedestrian bridge in the same area, the placement of loose Class 5 riprap at the new bridge abutments, and the use of concrete formliner, which will be painted, on the bridge abutments. The deck of the new bridge will be poured and finished concrete.

Construction can be performed year-round. The project is anticipated to begin in late summer 2009, and should take six months to complete. The estimated price is between $1 and $2 million.

PLEASE NOTE: The Invitation for Bid are expected to be available for download on or after November 10, 2009, from the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fedbizopps.gov. PLANS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD IN ADOBE (.pdf) FORMAT ONLY ON CFLHD's WEBSITE at http://www.cflhd.gov/procurement/construction/advertised-projects.cfm under the Project Name. Other information regarding this solicitation will also be available at the above website. 

Technical questions specific to the project will only be addressed by FHWA via written correspondence to e-mail address CFLContracts@fhwa.dot.gov or FAX to (720) 963-3360.

<DESC><p>Requirement: <br />The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Chelsea, MA, that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 4,122 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 3,504 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for&nbsp;10 years,&nbsp;with cancellation rights after&nbsp;5&nbsp;years. The space must be available for occupancy by September 10, 2010. The delineated area is:
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">North</span>: Revere Beach Parkway (Route 16) <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">East</span>: Broadway to Eastern Avenue to Chelsea Street to Curtis Street to Route 1A to I90 <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">South</span>: Boston Inner Harbor <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">West</span>: Mystic River to Island End River to Market Street, to 2nd Street.</p>
<p>The offered space must meet Government requirements for Fire Safety and Handicapped Accessibility.</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements include:</p>
<p>&bull; Proximity to Logan International Airport.<br />&bull; Parking (number of on site, reserved spaces (structured vs. surface) for official Government vehicles).</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Please send expressions of interest to:</p>

<p>Expressions of Interest must be submitted to the above address by 5:00 PM on May 25, 2010, and must include the following information:</p>
<p>&bull; Building name and address and location of the available space within the building.<br />&bull; Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.<br />&bull; ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF) to be offered and expected rental rate per OASF, fully serviced. Indicate whether or not the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any.<br />&bull; Date of space availability.<br />&bull; Method of rentable space measurement.<br />&bull; Building ownership information.<br />&bull; Amount of parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).<br />&bull; Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building.<br />&bull; List of building services provided.</p>
<p>The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) for the award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Contract to perform maintenance dredging of Hudson River, New York. The work involves maintenance dredging of approximately 54,000 cubic yards of material from the Hudson River Federal Navigation Project Channel at the Albany Turning Basin, with upland placement of the dredged material in the federally owned Houghtaling Island Placement Site. The dredging area is located approximately 15 miles from the placement site. The contractor is required to properly prepare the placement site prior to placing the dredged material in accordance with the contract requirements including the construction of new and/or reinforcement of existing containment dikes in the area designated for placement of the Albany Turning Basin sediments. The designated placement area was previously used for placement of dredged sediments that contained elevated levels of PCBs. Following completion of the Albany Turning Basin dredging, the contractor is required to place a minimum of two (2) feet of clean cover over the entire area designated for use for the Albany Turning Basin sediments even if the entire designated area is not used during the Albany Turning Basin placement operations. The contract includes a designated Mandatory Excavation Area (MEA) that must be used for dike construction/reinforcement and covering contaminated material. The Contractor is required to excavate a minimum of 100,000 cubic yards of material from the designated MEA. If the entire mandatory excavation quantity from the MEA is not used in the site construction and placement of a clean cover, the remaining material to be excavated is required to be deposited at designated stockpile locations within the Houghtaling Island Placement Site. The contractor will also be responsible for performing all sampling, testing, and monitoring activities to insure compliance with contract requirements.<br /><br />It is anticipated that dredging and disposal would take place within the approximate time period of June 2010 to December 2010; with final stabilization and clean-up of the Houghtaling Island placement site completed by May 2011. The work, including any option/s, is estimated to cost between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. Funding is provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Plans and Specifications for the subject project would be available on or about 12 May 2010, with Bid Opening on or about 12 June 2010. Bid opening will be held at 26 Federal Plaza, New York, New York 10278 in Room 1841.<br /><br />The Contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of receipt by the firm of the Notice to Proceed, to prosecute said work diligently, and to complete the work no later than three hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days after the receipt by the firm of the Notice to Proceed, depending on the award of options.

Brand Name Justification:

The VistA Imaging hardware and software platforms have been certified as a medical device by the FDA; therefore there are very specific requirements concerning the types of equipment that must be used for scanning, storing, and archiving images. The FDA requires that hardware vendors pursuing certification must go through the Veteran Administrations validation process.   Hewlett Packard has completed the validation process and is certified to provide the hardware, installation, and maintenance services for VistA Imaging.  As part of the equipment purchase, HP provides the following: Assemble equipment in the rack and deliver to site ready to go; Provide pre-site visit to facility to make sure that the computer room is ready, all equipment was delivered, and give an overview of the system to the staff; Provide field engineer to work with the facility staff to configure the equipment and train staff to maintain system; Provide on going support for hardware problems.  Additionally, a delivery order was awarded for a dedicated VistA Imaging infrastructure support Expertise Center.  The contract provides support for the sites that have implemented VI, or will be implementing VI in 2009/2010.  HP provides technical support to the medical facilities named below that use VI.  The support is specifically for the HP VI hardware.  Therefore, other VI VHA-certified brands cannot be accepted. 
 
Existing Facilities with VistA Imaging:  Navajo Area (Fort Defiance, Gallup, Chinle, Kayenta, North Navajo, Crownpoint, Shiprock); Billings Area; Phoenix Area;  Gila River Health Care Corporation; Portland Area; Nashville Area; Cherokee Indian Health Authority, Cherokee, NC; Chickasaw Nation; Choctaw Nation; Cherokee Nation; Tanana Chiefs (Fairbanks, AK).

THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): N/A<br><br>Prepare a Gross appraisal in accordance with the described Scope and Purpose following the USACE Gross Appraisal requirements and format example (attached). The format example contains pre-inserted (required) project information, estates to be appraised, etc. The appraiser shall address the other required appraisal elements in the gross appraisal format to complete the report.<BR><BR>Due to size of project / number of parcels, a cursory estimation of value for the identified parcels/real estate interests is required. Although the appraiser is required to utilize all sources of available market data to support value conclusions (comparable sales, MLS data, assessment data, SEV data, other professional sources, etc.), a separate appraisal for each parcel is not required. Although the gross appraisal methodology may reflect aspects of a market study or project/multiple parcel appraisal report, the appraiser is expected to apply the appropriate unit of measurement (land value, improvement value, easement value, damages, etc.) and assign a separate value estimation to each parcel. An exterior site inspection and photograph of all parcels is required. The appraiser is not required to make owner contact or complete an interior inspection of the improvements. There are numerous vacant and/or improved residential, commercial, and industrial properties that will require either a total acquisition or a partial acquisition of a levee or flowage easement.<BR><BR>It is the appraisers responsibility to estimate the value of the required Fee and Easement estates and, if applicable, identify, estimate, and apply all measures of damages (severance, proximity, parking loss, etc.) to the remainders resulting from the proposed easements.<BR>

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition



1.  Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, VA Puget Sound Health Care System.

2.  Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of technical support for the Dictaphone Enterprise Express Voice and Text software and hardware. 

3.  Description of Supplies or Services: VA Puget Sound Health Care System has a need for technical support for the software and hardware for the Dictaphone Enterprise Express Voice and Text. The dictation system must be operational 24x7 and requires experienced technical support in order to correct any problems as soon as possible so that the health care providers can continue using the dictation system. There are some hardware items that require being sent back to the repair service and shipped back to the medical center. This requirement was once available on GSA contract, but the vendor Nuance did not exercise the option renewal. 

4.  Statutory Authority:  
	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability, or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  This is technical software/hardware that requires specialized training, certification and experience in order to provide the level of diagnosis, repair and testing of the dictation system that are need for VA Puget Sound HCS. 

6.  Actions to Promote Competition:  No actions are taken at this time to seek sources outside of statutory requirements.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:   Historical rates from previous identical contracts varied less than 5% per year.

8.  Market Survey (FAR 7.102): Alpha Transcription is a SDVOSB who was determined initially to be qualified to performed the service.  After the vendor reviewed the full scope of the requirement, it was determined that the vendor was no longer qualified due the highly technical aspect of the work. Previously, Dictaphone Corporation contracted out the required service on a national basis several years ago to a company called Getronics. This outside contract was in place only perhaps one year and Dictaphone discontinued using Getronics because they did not have the technical expertise and experience necessary to complete the required service.

9.  Other Considerations: Not Applicable.

10.  Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: AlphaTranscription has expressed interest and concluded not being capable of meeting the requirement.

11.  Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: No actions intended as the action is based on statutory authority for sole source.  

12.  Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
