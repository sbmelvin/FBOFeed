North Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and Southwest Virginia.  Tennessee Congressman Zack Wamp launched the annual regional summit in 1995.  MSFC?s membership in this effort has resulted in Memoranda of Understandings between MSFC and other corridor partners.  Previous Summits have also led to a number of significant accomplishments in the region including the development of an innovative Tri-Lateral Alliance for interagency cooperation between NASA?s Marshall Space Flight Center, the Air Force?s Arnold Engineering Development Center and the Department of Energy?s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Y-12 defense plant, as well as several other key initiatives, partnerships and projects important to fulfilling key federal missions while boosting the region?s economic development.  The groundwork that has been laid by this summit and the resulting Memoranda of Understandings make this organization the only source available to the Marshall Space Flight Center in the promotion of the Tennessee Valley and various summit partners and what they have to offer in the areas of science and research. The Tennessee Valley Corridor Summit is scheduled for May 31 through June 2,2004, in Knoxville, TN and November 8-9, 2004 in Somerset, KY.  The Marshall Space Flight Center has made a commitment to the Tennessee Valley Corridor to 	be a major sponsor of the Spring and Fall summits.  The Center?s participation in the sponsorship of the summit will have a significant effect on the promotion of 	science and technology within the Tennessee Valley; affecting not only the Center, but universities, other Federal agencies, and private industry located in the 	Tennessee Valley.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Hope Rayburn at hope.rayburn@msfc.nasa.gov no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 21, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>BASIS FOR AWARD: Technical proposals will be evaluated using the following factors, of equal importance, based on a peer scientific review.  (a) Demonstrated technical and/or scientific merit and its relevancy to current AFRL needs, including capabilities and related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these which are an integral factor for achieving proposal objectives, (b) impact of successful development on the performance of sensor systems and AFRL mission, (c) new or unique ideas which enhance state-of-the-art or scientific knowledge, (d) the qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achievement of the proposed objectives, (c) feasibility of accomplishing tasks. Cost proposals ( to be submitted with full proposals-not with white papers ) will be evaluated using the factor of completeness, reasonableness and realism.  Technical considerations are more important than cost, although cost will be considered a significant factor.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting proposals.  Subject to the availability of funds, the Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received.  See Note 26.

<CONTACT>Daniel Radack, DARPA Program Manager, Phone 000-000-0000, Fax 703-696-2206, Email none
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Robust Integrated Power Electronics (RIPE).  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice.  Power electronics play a critical role in nearly every military and commercial system by providing high quality power from the energy sources to the loads with low parasitic losses.  Modern power electronics are often manufactured from the silicon semiconductor material.  While silicon-based power electronics are ubiquitous and mature, there are inherent limitations in frequency, voltage, current, and performance due to the underlying material properties.  New semiconductor material systems may enable development of more compact, more efficient, more robust power electronics.  The Robust Integrated Power Electronics (RIPE) Program intends to pursue research and development of the most promising devices and circuits in these material systems, and to explore the integration of those new technologies with other electronics and components to provide significant overall enhancements in power electronics or electronics for harsh environments.

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:  devices and circuits, reactive components and assemblies, and applications.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 04-22 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site--http://teaming.sysplan.com/RIPE/ --has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Daniel J. Radack, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail:  dradack@darpa.mil. 

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled “BAA 04-22, Robust Integrated Power Electronics (RIPE), Proposer Information Pamphlet” which provides further information on areas of interest:  devices and circuits, reactive components and assemblies, and applications; the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals.  An original and six (6) copies of the proposal abstract and two electronic copies (i.e., two separate disks) of the abstract [in PDF (preferred), MS-Word readable, HTML, or ASCII format each on a CD-ROM (preferred), a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, or a single 100 MB Iomega Zip disk] should be submitted.  Offerors may optionally include a short viewgraph summary of their proposed effort.  This summary should not exceed two (2) slides in conventional presentation format and should be in either PowerPoint or PDF format.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 04-22, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy __ of 2.  The proposal abstract (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.:  BAA 04-22), and must be received by DARPA on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Friday, May 7, 2004.  Proposal abstracts received after this time and date may not be reviewed.  Upon review of the abstract, DARPA will provide written notice on the likelihood of a full proposal being considered for selection, and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposers not submitting proposal abstracts must submit an original and six (6) copies of the full proposal and two electronic copies (i.e., two separate disks) of the full proposal [in PDF (preferred), MS-Word readable, HTML, or ASCII format, each on a CD-ROM (preferred), a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, or a single 100 MB Iomega Zip disk].  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 04-22, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy __ of 2.  Offerors may optionally include a short viewgraph summary of their proposed effort.  This summary should not exceed four (4) slides in conventional presentation format and should be in either PowerPoint or PDF format.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 04-22), and must be received by DARPA on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Monday, June 28, 2004, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 04-22 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received, and to make awards without discussions.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in Robust Integrated Power Electronics.

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 04-22.  Proposals and proposal abstracts may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Evaluation of proposal abstracts and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (1) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost realism.  Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort.

<SOLNBR>DE-RP06-04RL14655
<CONTACT>Michael Barrett, Contracting Officer, 509-373-4143, michael_k_barrett@rl.gov;Michael Barrett, Contract Specialist, 509-373-4143, michael_k_barrett@rl.gov
<DESC>ENERGY DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR HANFORD SITE RIVER CORRIDOR PROCUREMENT The Department of Energy (DOE) has announced next steps for the procurement of services for the closure of the Hanford Site River Corridor, an area of approximately 210 square miles along the Columbia River. DOE has considered the comments received from industry and other interested parties on the draft solicitation for the Hanford Site River Corridor that was issued in December 2003*.  DOE received positive commentary overall from industry on the accelerated closure approach and the approaches used to remediate and close the Hanford Site River Corridor. DOE received additional comments on the impact of the draft cleanup schedule on work that the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is performing in facilities located in the Hanford Site River Corridor.  In response to the comments, DOE will revise the solicitation to establish a time-phased approach for cleaning up the PNNL-utilized facilities.  Changes to the solicitation will assure that the cleanup schedule will not disrupt critical ongoing PNNL activities.  DOE will direct the contractor at PNNL to cooperate in that effort.  Accordingly, the buildings will not be required to be vacated prior to 2009.  We therefore do not anticipate that any PNNL researchers will be displaced from employment. DOE plans to issue a new solicitation for the Hanford Site River Corridor work.  DOE plans to cancel the initial solicitation and issue a new solicitation for reasons that include the significant changes that would be required to the initial solicitation and the substantial passage of time since the release of the initial solicitation. Unlike the original solicitation, the new solicitation will provide for full closure of the Hanford Site River Corridor as part of DOE's accelerated cleanup strategy.  DOE hopes to issue the final solicitation in April 2004 and to award the contract by fall 2004. The DOE e-center will remain the information source for industry and other interested parties for this important acquisition. This information has been posted on the Hanford Site River Corridor solicitation website, located at http://www.pr.doe.gov/iips/busopor.nsf/. *  The prior posting on the DOE E-Center showed the draft solicitation number as ?14556?.  The correct number should be ?14655?.

<SOLNBR>DTFAWA-04-C-00030
<RESPDATE>041504
<ARCHDATE>05152004
<CONTACT>Darryl Anderson, (202)267-7699
<DESC>This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.2.4 to inform industry of the FAAâ€™s intent to award a single source contract to Boeing Air Traffic Management (ATM). The single source contract will continue the modeling and analysis work for the Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) to determine the feasibility of a CAT II/III satellite based system.  The estimated Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) for this effort will not exceed $7.0 million if all optional tasks are exercised. The period of performance for this contract is not expected to go beyond September 2005. The FAA established the LAAS program to replace the current ground based Instrument Landing System (ILS) with satellite-based technology.  LAAS will use signals from the current GPS satellites and augment their accuracy to perform CAT II/III zero visibility landings for domestic and international flights. Key international integrity, continuity, and accuracy requirements must be verified before development of a LAAS CAT II/III landing system is undertaken.  To accomplish this verification a multi-year research and development effort was started to determine how the requirements are allotted between the air and the ground components, and their vulnerability to intentional RF interference.  In August 2003 Boeing collected airborne multipath data on their 777-300ER and 737-NG airframes.  This data needs to be analyzed as to whether airborne multipath is properly characterized and can be certified for use to model other airframe types.  The results will be used in error budgets to determine required accuracies, time to alarm, continuity, and integrity requirements. In addition, to verifying requirements, the terrorist incident at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, raised serious questions about the systemâ€™s vulnerability to intentional jamming.  Until this potential or real vulnerability can be explored and the risk assessed or resolved, the current ILS will remain in operation.   Boeing is the only U.S. manufacturer with the capability to characterize all Category III capable passenger aircraft. Boeingâ€™s unique capabilities include:  Their experience in FAA certification processes associated with GPS Landing Systems (GLS) certification.   This experience is critical to derivation of error limits associated with requirements development.  Boeing has direct and current experience with all aspects of CAT III capable passenger aircraft design, international certification, legacy auto-land flight-test programs (e.g. Instrument Landing System), and integration of FAA certified aircraft components (e.g. INS, radar altimeter, FMS, certified autopilot, etc.) with airframe.  Also Boeingâ€™s unique relationship with the airlines will allow the most efficient coordination for future NAS implementation of avionics necessary to develop CAT II/III GPS based landing system.  No other U.S. contractor has or can obtain all of these capabilities. In the event the sole source justification is not approved the following adverse actions will occur:  The loss of Governmentâ€™s investment in terms of time and funding and the absence of long term tangible benefits to the aviation community.  The Governmentâ€™s loss of Boeingâ€™s extensive modeling and substantial data collected using a commercial passenger aircraft.  No other contractor is sufficiently knowledgeable in this area to attempt to duplicate Boeingâ€™s effort using a commercial passenger aircraft.  Further, the agency cannot make the same financial investment in another vendor to satisfy LAAS program requirements without significant schedule loss.  Finally, much of the work performed is predicated upon aircraft data that is proprietary to Boeing and is not available in the commercial marketplace. The proprietary nature of the aircraft data is fundamental to the modeling analysis needed to complete tasks from previous government validation activities. Release of Boeing data to any competitor in design or manufacturing of any aircraft type could compromise Boeing aircraft proprietary information and design methods. As a result, neither the FAA nor its contractors can utilize the data or the plans to implement modeling with the data, and the work would have to be redone.  Performing the above described analysis, characterization and certification is critical to the FAAâ€™s decision whether airborne multipath can be used to model other airframe types and further development of a LAAS CAT II or III landing system.  Boeing has demonstrated under the previous effort that it has the knowledge and resources to satisfy LAAS program requirements.  Boeing ATM is the only viable source with the unique understanding and knowledge of the work to be performed.  Therefore, the FAA has determined that it is in the best interest of the Government to make a single source award to Boeing ATM. Inquiries relative to this announcement are to be submitted in writing by regular mail or by email to the following: Federal Aviation Administration ATTN: Darryl Anderson, ASU-310 800 Independence Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20591 darryl.anderson@faa.gov The FAA is not liable for costs associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries addressing this announcement. This is not a request for proposals.

The Tri-Service Nursing Research Program is a Congressionally-appropriated initiative directed at military nursing research.  The purpose of this program is to improve health care for DoD beneficiaries by expanding the scientific knowledge base through military nursing research.  This program provides infrastructure and educational support for nurturing and retaining military nurse scientists and provides grants to military nurse scientists in the area of military nursing to strengthen military nursing research efforts in the Army, Navy, and Air Force.  The program is headed by an Executive Director, a military nurse, who oversees and is responsible for all operational aspects of the program and reports directly to the Chiefs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Nurse Corps.  The Executive Director serves as the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR), overseeing and coordinating all contracting actions with the USUHS Contracting Officer.  The specific requirements for the program parts are very briefly described within this announcement, and they will be described in more detail in the solicitation, or request for proposals (RFP), that is to be issued shortly.  (1) Program management support requires the contractor to provide administrative staff to support day-to-day operations to manage the office workload of administrative duties, such as, but not limited to, handling correspondence, copying, and mailing; maintaining entries into databases; processing orders for program supplies and services; processing travel orders and claims, and keeping track of travel expenditures.  (2) Program outreach and dissemination efforts require, but are not limited to, reviewing, updating, and maintaining the Web site; and distributing program educational brochures to designated groups and schools.  (3) Assisting with peer review of grant proposals requires the contractor to provide a variety of administrative support functions in order to support the whole cycle of grants award management.  The cycle begins with the development of a program announcement calling for proposals and continues through award of funding.  (4) Post award grants administration requires the contractor to provide support assistance for all post-award grants management issues on grants awarded through this program up to five years after award.  (5)  Providing support in conducting workshops, meetings, and seminars requires the contractor to provide all administrative, logistical, and meeting-planning aspects of these types of events for the program.  A cost contract for non-personal services for a total of five years, inclusive of a base period and four option periods, is anticipated to be awarded.  This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside, and contractors shall be expected to follow the self-certification requirements of the FAR.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, on behalf of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, intends to award a firm-fixed price sole source contract to Independent Studio Services, 9545 Wentworth Street, Sunland, CA 91040-1626.  This requirement is for 50,000 rounds of 7.62 millimeter x 39-millimeter blank rounds for use in pre-deployment training.  This action is in support of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory Project Metropolis.  Independent Studio Services (ISS) is the only responsible source for these ammunition blanks.  The Blank Firing Adapters (BFAs) used on the AK-47 rifles that are in the current stock for SASO training, were originally purchased from Independent Studio Services.  The 7.62mm x 39mm blank ammunition that is available through ISS is calibrated to work specifically with these BFAs.  Because standard 7.62mm x 39mm blank ammunitions are not designed with as heavy a grain load as the ISS blanks, the action of the rifle will not be able to completely cycle when fired, which would prevent the weapon from going into fully automatic fire.  No Request for Proposal is available for competitive bidding; however, interested parties may submit a written statement of capability for satisfying this requirement to the address identified above not later than 14 April 2004. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) serves the educational needs of dependents of the military and civilian employees stationed in 14 foreign countries, 7 states, Puerto Rico, and Guam.

The school system offers a typical American education and uses materials and equipment comparable to stateside schools.

DoDEA is responsible for establishing curriculum and purchasing instructional materials for students enrolled in its 222 schools. The procedures for updating curriculum materials every 6 years are defined in the DoDEA Curriculum Development Cycle.  In accordance with these curriculum cycle procedures, visual arts educators have developed and written the DoDEA Visual Arts content standards (attachment 2) to reflect the philosophy and trends established in the National Art Education Standards. DoDEA also requires updated instructional development that helps correlate newly adopted instructional materials with the new visual arts content standards and professional development to help teachers effectively implement the new materials.

DoDEA currently requires educational materials and services for a Visual Arts Curriculum adoption covering the Visual Arts in grades 7 through 12. DoDEA will not purchase new text books, but will instead concentrate resources in supplemental art materials (print and nonprint), multimedia materials, and training designed to give DoDEA educators the expertise needed to implement the above mentioned materials.

The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) serves the educational needs of dependents of the military and civilian employees stationed in 14 foreign countries, 7 states, Puerto Rico, and Guam. DoDEA enrolls approximately 75,000 students annually in grades Pre-Kindergarten (PK) through 6.  The school system offers a typical American education and uses materials and equipment comparable to stateside schools.

DoDEA is responsible for establishing curriculum and purchasing instructional materials for students enrolled in its 222 schools. The procedures for updating curriculum materials every 6 years are defined in the DoDEA Curriculum Development Cycle.  In accordance with these curriculum cycle procedures, visual arts educators have developed and written the DoDEA Visual Arts content standards (see attachment 2) to reflect the philosophy and trends established in the National Art Education Standards. DoDEA also requires updated instructional development that helps correlate newly adopted instructional materials with the new visual arts content standards and professional development to help teachers effectively implement the new materials.

DoDEA currently requires educational materials and services for a Visual Arts Curriculum adoption covering the Visual Arts in grades PK through 6. DoDEA will not purchase new text books, but will instead concentrate resources in supplemental art materials, technology, software, multimedia materials, and training.

<DESC>MRI of the Brain Non-Contrast Study in support of former Prisoners of War (POW) requirements are as follows:  0001 MRI services are required to provide 100 NONCONTRAST MIR’s , each study is to be read by a radiologist, and a copy of the actual film be provided to the Robert I. Mitchell Center for POW Studies, located at NAS Pensacola, Florida.  A global rate (MRI services plus professional services) is requested.  A radiologist must be on duty at the location (not just on call) during the MRI process and the facility offering service must be within the Pensacola, FL. area since this is where the patients will be during their physical exams.  The purpose of the studies is primarily clinical, (diagnosis of cortical atrophy), but also research, as the former POWs have been subjected to horrendous physical and mental conditions over extended period; i.e., 5 to 7 years.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for renewal of an annual software maintenance of EDS IDEAS-Analysis Engineering software at NASA LaRC.  The proposed period of performance is one year. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from EDS (Unigraphics Solutions, Inc) as the only known source who can meet agency requirements.  IDEAS/Analysis software is only available from EDS (Unigraphics Solutions, Inc) because all IDEAS software is proprietary.  NASA LaRC is currently using the IDEAS/Analysis software in the Structural Dynamics Branch to generate complicated structural models for the Ultra Light Inflatable Structures and Gossamer/New Millennium Program.  EDS (Unigraphics Solutions, Inc) is the only known responsible source who can provide the technical support, modifications, and upgrades to the LaRC owned software. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 23, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation/notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only notice of intent and a written notice of intent will not be issued.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Three Springs Scientific for African green monkeys of St Kitt origin, for respiratory Syncytial Virus Research.  The Notice of Intent number is being issued as NOI4059.  This Notice of Intent document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2001-22.  The NIAID, NIH, has a requirement to purchase approximately fifty (50) Cercocebus Aethiops (African green monkeys) St Kitts-PIV and approximately fifty (50) crates for transporting the African green monkeys. These items are to be delivered to the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland via FOB Origin.  This is a small disadvantage business and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 112990 and the small business size standard is $0.75 million.  The NIAID is involved in numerous projects for Bio-Defense vaccine development and most recently since the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).  The NIAID is tasked with the main research in NIH on the study of SARS and to develop a vaccine.  Studies in the NIAID focus primarily on viruses that play an important role in disease of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, the liver, and the reticuloendothelial system. Currently, NIAID employs the techniques of viral genetics and molecular biology to express protective viral antigens and attenuate viral mutants that may prove useful for prevention of disease. A number of promising live attenuated viral vaccines and virus-specific immunotherapies are under development and evaluation.  The NIAID conducts research directed toward defining the cause and epidemiology of medically important viral diseases and developing means for their control. NIAID engages in a wide range of research activities that extends from identification and antigenic characterization of viruses that cause systemic disease or acute disease of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and the liver to basic molecular studies of viral structure, function, and genome organization. Scientists in the laboratory employ molecular biologic techniques to elucidate pathogenesis of disease as well as to develop purified subunit antigens and attenuated viral mutants for use in prevention of respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and systemic viral diseases.  The approximately 50 listed Cercocebus Aethiops (African green monkeys of St Kitt origin) have been identified and serologically screened and are seronegative for Parainfluenza Viruses (PIV) 1, 2, 3 and HMPV.  African green monkeys are the most sensitive for detecting and evaluating infection with PIV 1, 2, 3, and HMPV.  RVS has increased needs for this species of non-human primate to test the potency of new lots of candidate PIV 1, 2, 3 vaccine, determine the dose response to this vaccine, explore the feasibility of post-exposure vaccination, examine cross-protection and measure the duration of protective immunity. NIAID studies are in anticipation of preparing PIV 1, 2, 3 vaccines for human use.  Large numbers of African green monkeys are required so the lots of vaccines can be characterized before human clinical trials begin.  Since Three Springs Scientific has supplied African green monkeys to NIAID in the past they must continue to provide these specific African green monkeys in order to compare data analyses and maintain consistency in the results.  The necessary items are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12.  FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition are FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial; FAR 52-212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, FAR Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contractor Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items.  Offerors must include with their offer a completed copy of the provisions of FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items.  This action will be under the authority of Section 4202 Clinger Cohen Act of 1996, as set forth in FAR Part 6.302-1 AND HHSAR 306-302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can perform the above requirements, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NIAID to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 4:00 PM EDT (Eastern Daylight Time), April 19, 2004.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Nataki McCowin, Purchasing Agent, at nmccowin@niaid.nih.gov or by fax (301) 480-3695.  For delivery through postal service the address is NIH/NIAID/AMOB, 10401 Fernwood Drive, Suite 2NE70, Room/2NE70B, MSC/4812, Bethesda, Maryland 20817-4812.  A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed requirement shall be based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Notice of Intent number NOI4059 must be cited on all correspondence!!

<DESC>This solicitation is a total small business set-aside.  The NAICS is 541380 with a size standard of $6 million.  The solicitation will be processed in accordance with FAR Part 12, "Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The safe drinking water act (SDWA) mandates the EPA to establish a list of unregulated microbiological and chemical contaminants to aid in priority setting for the Agency's drinking water program. This list is referred to as the Contaminant Candidate List ( CCL ). The CCL identifies contaminants which might be regulated by the EPA at some future date. The Treatment Technology Evaluation Branch (TTEB) within the Water Supply and Water Resources Division, NRMRL is conducting in-house research associated with chemicals on the CCL. The TTEB research project involves the evaluation of conventional water treatments for the removal of the CCL chemicals from drinking water.  The contractor will analyze samples produced as part of this in-house research.  Samples will primarily be drinking water, spiked with the analyte of interest, that has undergone drinking water treatment e.g., membrane filtration, coagulation or GAC filtration. The radiological analyses will be for background determinations of naturally occurring  radium isotopes found in drinking water. These samples will be comprised of drinking water,  pipe scales and filter media drawn from various drinking water systems.   The following methods will be used:  515.1; 524.2; 508; 8270C; 8330; 525.2; 632; and 8321;  The contract will include a base requirement of 750 samples with an option for up to 750 additional samples.  Approximately 20-30 samples per week will be generated. Some weeks could have as many as 50, while some weeks may have none.  Companies that submit a proposal must demonstrate EPA, State, NELAP,  or similar certification.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

If the contractor has not performed this procedure within the last year, they are not considered a qualif ied or proven producer and would be required to successfully complete first article testing requirements, which could take up to one year or longer.  The Government requires a delivery rate of at least 40 units monthly beginning in May 2004 to a facility l ocated in Orlando, Florida, until completion of all contracted quantities.  The Government does not own the complete technical data package to detail the manufacture of the item, testing of the item or the development of the required optical table and alig nment procedures.  This limited source acquisition is authorized under 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1.  Point of Contact is Ellen Widelitz, 732-446-6650, E-mail address, ellen.widelitz@us.army.mil.

<CONTACT>Contract Buyer is Brandy Epperson,937-255-2619 ext. 3004
<DESC>Sources are sought for an effort to verify improved durability to the Pratt + Whitney F100 engine exhaust  nozzle divergent seals utilizing advanced high temperature  Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC).   The United States Air Force operates F-15 and F-16 fighter  aircraft powered by the F100 turbine engine.  This turbine  engine has an axisymmetric translating nozzle with an aft  divergent section.  This nozzle currently utilizes 15  metallic divergent seals that have a high field replacement  rate.  This requires frequent inspections and the universal  availability of spares in the field for sustained mission  readiness.  Advanced technologies are being sought to  increase engine exhaust nozzle life and reliability for  improved warfighter readiness.   Contractors must possess the technical ability to perform  an advanced component verification task.  This task shall  include F100-229 exhaust nozzle divergent seal fabrication,  assembly, flight-testing, performance parameter  verification, data analysis, and reporting.   Given the limited life of current metallic divergent seals,  only experienced contractors utilizing advanced high  temperature Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC) will be  considered.  F100-229 divergent seals, spares, and metallic attachment  hardware that may be fastened directly to the CMC will be  contractor provided.  It is anticipated the F100-229 engine  and test aircraft will be government furnished. Sources shall ensure any proposed solution will result in  turbine engine exhaust nozzle technologies capable of  meeting full life.  The full life requirement is 4300 Total  Accumulated Cycles (TAC) for the F100-229 exhaust nozzle  divergent seals.   Potential sources will need to have verified a minimum of  90% full life through actual F100-229 ground engine  experience.   A successful ground test is defined as completing the  ground testing with no through-thickness cracks in the test  articles, and no delaminations greater than 9 square inches  and contained to only the surface ply for the test  articles.  The estimated award date is Dec 2004.  This date is subject  to change.  The period of performance is anticipated to be  24 months for the technical effort plus 4 months to prepare  the Final Report. Routine communications concerning this synopsis should be  directed to Brandy Epperson, Contract Negotiator, at (937)  255-7243, ext. 3004 or Jackie Owens, Contracting Officer,  at (937) 255-7243, ext. 3001.

<SUBJECT>A --Gunship Multispectral Sensor (GMS) 2
<SOLNBR>GMS2
<RESPDATE>040704
<CONTACT>Katherine Hamblin,(937) 255-3594
<DESC>The USAF Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), on behalf of The Boeing Company – Special Operations Forces Aerospace Support Center, is soliciting information  to analyze alternatives for a turreted, Gunship Multispectral Sensor (GMS) to  replace the All Light Level TV (ALLTV) subsystem on the AC-130U Gunship.  The  initial intent is to install four systems under a temporary (T-1) modification  program via a Combat Missions Need Statement.  This announcement is issued for  informational planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or  commit the Government or the Boeing Company to award a contract now or in the  future.  Submitting information for this announcement is voluntary, and  participants will not be compensated.  The objective of the Gunship Multispectral Sensor (GMS) modification to the AC- 130U Gunship aircraft is to provide enhanced detection, recognition, and  positive combat identification of targets under all light level conditions  without the aid of artificial illumination sources.  The missions of the AC- 130U, equipped with a Multispectral Sensor, include but are not limited to  close air support; troops in combat mission; perimeter/airbase defense; convoy,  helicopter, train or naval escort; air interdiction; reconnaissance/armed  reconnaissance, surveillance; search and rescue support; limited airborne  command and control; forward air controller operations; and other special  operations support missions.  During the conduct of these missions the AC-130U  requires the capability to detect, recognize, and positively identify Special  Operations Forces (SOF) targets and friendly forces from operationally  significant ranges.  The GMS will also provide a laser designation and ranging  capability for weapons delivery, an eye safe laser ranging capability, and a  NIR Pointer for target marking and friendly forces identification. Respondents to this announcement, who are initially determined by The Boeing  Company to be viable suppliers, will be sent a Request For Information (RFI)  and an information package that further defines the system and interface  requirements.  The System Requirements Document (SRD) and the Interface  Description Document (IDD), including any attachments, may contain information  subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) or Export  Administration Regulation (EAR) of 1979, which may not be exported, released or  disclosed to foreign nationals inside or outside the U.S. without first  obtaining an export license.   Elements of the GMS program are classified to the SECRET level.  Potential  suppliers must possess a valid site security clearance and will be required to  complete a DD254 prior to exchange of any classified information.  The information and data supplied by you as a result of the RFI will be  reviewed by The Boeing Company and may become part of a proposal submitted to  Boeing’s customer.   If your company is determined to be a viable candidate supplier, a team of  technical experts may visit your facility to discuss technical details of your  capabilities.  The technical team will be comprised of Boeing and Government  personnel and academic and U.S. Laboratory experts.  This may require  Proprietary Information Agreements (PIAs).  The site visit may take place  approximately 2 weeks after receipt of your response to the RFI. As a result of the technical information received from suppliers and completed  site surveys, viable suppliers may be requested to respond to a Request for  Proposal (RFP).  RFP’s will be issued on or about 3 May 2004, with quotes due  no later than 7 June 2004.  A requirement of the RFP will be for the  demonstration of a viable system at a government facility. Tentative schedule  for a side-by-side demonstration of all viable suppliers’ systems will be  conducted near the end of August 2004.  Delivery of first turret is expected in  December 05.   Responses to this announcement should be sent via e-mail to GMS2@boeing.com and  must be received no later than COB 15 April 2004.  Responses must include a  general description of your candidate system and its capabilities along with  points of contact to discuss technical, contractual and security questions.  In  addition, if a company website is available to review information pertaining to  a candidate system or similar product line, please include this is the  response.  For more information on GMS2--Gunship Multispectral Sensor (GMS) 2 please refer to http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixslibr/GMS2/GMS2.asp

<DESC>This is not a notice for a solicitation.  This is only a Request for Information (RFI).  The Government does not intend to award a contract or any type of agreement on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicitated under this RFI.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation to bid; merely a request for information.  The U.S. Geological Survey is considering contracting for support services for the bureau's Continuity of Operations Plan.  The type of support required may necessitate the service provider to have the flexibility for tailoring the existing plan to comport with the latest versions of Executive Orders, Presidential Directives, Federal Preparedness Circulars, National Response Plans, National Incident Management Systems, National Incident Management System Integration Center protocols, and all other continuity of operations guidance documents and protocols prescribed by the Department of Homeland Security.  Support services required include development of an initial analysis of the existing National Center Plan to determine deficiencies within existing documents as compared to federal requirements and providing recommendations for fully complying with Federal and Departmental requirements, integration of the National Center Plan within internal Occupant Emergency Procedures with links to Departmental and Mission Essential Site Plans, development of Incident Command/tool kit for senior executives and operational personnel involved with plan implementation, conducting formal training for senior executives and operational personnel involved in implementation, and conducting tabletop exercises to test the viability of the plan.  The estimated project completion and execution date is October 2004.  Interested parties that are registered in the Central Contractor Registration at www.ccr.gov and believe they have the expertise and experience to meet this requirement may submit a response to this RFI.  Responses shall include whether the responding firm is on the GSA Federal Schedule or holds any other Federal contracting vehicles.  Also include any commercial price lists.  The response format should not exceed 10 pages inclusive of facts/figures.  Company and product brochures are not an acceptable part of this response.  The response should be prepared using Microsoft word.  Questions and all responses should be submitted to the Contracting Officer, Melissa W. Gill at mgill@usgs.gov.  Responses are due no later that close of business on April 23, 2004.  Any subsequent solicitation will be synopsized prior to its release.

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard, Maintenance and Logistics Command, Atlantic is seeking sources that can provided the following parts and services for a prototype engine overhaul / modification of a single diesel engine on a 140’ WTGB Icebreaking tugboat located at Sault St. Marie, MI.  Overhaul /Modification will be done at the vessels homepier in Sault St. Marie, MI.  The known Fairbanks Morse Engine Parts Needed Are:  Part Number 16103236 (16 Needed) Ring, Piston Oil Drain, Spring Loaded; Part Number 16606240 (8 Needed) SVK Piston, Lower-Serv Repl-S. AS; Part Number 16606238 (8 Needed) SVK Piston, Upper Serv Repl-S. AS; 16611472 (16 Needed) Nozzel Assy, Pintle 2400Psi TD 1; 16113439 (1 Needed) Std Pump Vacuum Crankcase 300 C; MISCOP (1 Needed) PLC Controller Jack Wtr and Air Bypass Control; 12996894 (1 Needed) Valve, 4” 3-Way; MISC (1 Needed) Core Charge, Unit Exchange/Reconditioning.  Services being requested are: (1) Evaluate the existing diesel engine’s salient features, to include the operating conditions, conditions of the existing machinery, review of the available service records of the engine, and the application of OEM and after-market components.  (2) Provide a unit exchange or rebuild existing fuel injection pumps to produce a change to the existing injection timing of the engine to achieve higher exhaust temps at lower engine loads.  (3) Provide and install an external motor-driven vacuum fan to ensure that the engine remains under proper vacuum irrespective of engine speed.  (4) Provide and install an air-operated, PLC controlled, temperature control valve in the engine’s jacket water system.  The valve will be configured to regulate jacket water temperature based on existing lube oil temperature.  (5) Provide and install a PLC control panel to control the above mentioned control valve as well as the existing air by-pass actuator for the installed blower.  (6) Provide elementary wiring schematics for all newly installed components including the proposed connection points into the ship’s existing power supply.  (7) Provide and install a suitable crankshaft air seal to reduce lost crankcase vacuum.  (8) Calibrate the existing Lube Oil Sump bayonet gage to ensure it complies with engine OEM Service Bulletin, Volume “A”, Issue 12, dated June 22, 1987.  (9) Perform an inspection of the engine’s existing vertical drive shaft assembly and provide a report on the condition of the components relative to the OEM tech manual.  (10) Perform an inspection of the engine’s existing roots blower and provide a report on the condition of the components relative to the EOM tech manual.  The inspection shall include the conduct of an air test.  (11) Perform an inspection of the engine’s existing gear train at the free end of the engine and provide a report on the condition of the components relative to the OEM tech manual.  The only known source to the Government for the parts and services listed above is Fairbanks Morse Engine, Beloit, WI.  This installation is a prototype modification that will address documented concerns associated with light load operation, while maintaining optimum high icebreaking steady state and transient performance.  The light load concerns include excessive oil injection into the exhaust manifolds and piping.  Excessive exhaust oil injection also leads to the cutter’s topside surfaces getting coated with a slippery film of oil.  The oil injection is also an environmental concern, whether carried directly into the sea, or into the bilge.  The second primary low load concern is high smoke opacity.  The prototype installation goals are intended to demonstrate a Fairbanks Morse Engines proprietary modification approach that will successfully address the low load concerns, while maintaining optimum icebreaking steady state and transient load performance.  The engine is a unique opposed piston design.  One of the environmental concerns associated with the 140’ WTGB MSA main engine design decision is whether a modified Fairbanks Morse 8-38D8-1/8 engine will have to meet Environmental Protection Agency Tier 2 exhaust emission requirements.  There may be vendors that can repair and tune the FBM diesel, but as a result of these unique design characteristics, it is believed that only the OEM, Fairbanks Morse Engine Division, possesses the design criteria, historical expertise, and technical ability to develop a new load-carrying profile for this engine.  The desired outcome of the engine modification should allow the vessel to operate safely and environmentally compliant at lower vessel speeds associated with new DHS Law Enforcement duties.  Any other business sources, able to provide the above listed parts and services are encouraged to respond to this announcement within 10 days of its publication.  Interested firms should submit in writing, its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, business size and a brief statement regarding it capability to provide the above listed parts, services and experience working on this type of engine.  The information should be submitted to the address stated herein or may be faxed to telephone number 757-628-4676, ATTN:  Wendy Culbreth.  The small business size standard is less than 1000 employees and the NAICS Code is 333618.  This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation.  All responsible sources may respond.

<DESC>No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror¡¦s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Synopsis: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking potential partners to team with LaRC to submit proposals in support of the Validation and Calibration (VALCAL) of scientific instruments on board the AURA satellite. LaRC¡¦s Far-Infrared Spectroscopy of the Troposphere (FIRST) instrument will capture the VALCAL data by means of high altitude balloon observations. The FIRST instrument is a nadir-viewing Michelson Interferometer covering the spectral range from 10 to 100 ƒÝm (1000 to 100 cm-1) at 0.6 cm-1 spectral resolution.  The FIRST instrument will observe upwelling radiation from the Earth and its atmosphere.  FIRST will use a broad bandpass beamsplitter, a passively cooled high throughput optical system, and a passively cooled detector system to achieve accurately calibrated measurements of the far-infrared (far-IR, 15-100 mm) portion of the Earth's outgoing longwave radiation that is virtually unobserved directly. The far-IR contains up to half the radiant energy emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere and is strongly modulated by water vapor (the main greenhouse gas) and cirrus clouds. FIRST is an instrument that combines radiation budget sensing with temperature and moisture vertical profiling capability. The FIRST payload is designed to fly on a high-altitude balloon platform. NASA is seeking partners to prepare the payload for several anticipated balloon launches in the 2005 to 2008 time frame in support of AURA validation from sites in the United States, Canada, and possibly Antarctica. The selected partner shall have demonstrated capabilities required to perform pre-launch calibration and testing the FIRST sensor in the laboratory. The selected partner(s) shall  perform all support activities related to preparing and flying payload, data capture, and payload recovery. The partner(s) shall also perform post-flight testing, calibration, data reduction, and evaluation of the FIRST sensor. NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigator (PI) and the FIRST science team in the AURA FIRST Program to develop proposals. Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that selected proposal(s) would result in contract(s) for the selected partner(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates needed for proposal preparation. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience with the efforts synopsized for each intended LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance:  (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel. This criterion evaluates the proposers' relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included.  (2) Cost and schedule control. This criterion evaluates the proposers' ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area.  (3) Facilities. This criterion evaluates the proposers' facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives.  TECHNICAL QUESTIONS should be directed to:  Martin G Mlynczak 757-864- 5695 m.g.mlynczak@nasa.gov. Procurement related questions should be directed to: David O.

<ARCHDATE>06222004
<CONTACT>Pamela  Burleson, (508) 233-4368
<DESC>The U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center, PM Force Sustainment Systems, has a requirement for a Containerized Kitchen (CK).  The CK is a mobile field kitchen that provides a labor efficient, rapidly deployable, food preparation capability, able to prepar e and serve a minimum of 800 meals up to three times per day.  It consists of a combination of existing military standard equipment and commercial components that are integrated into a Convention for Safe Containers (CSC) certified expandable 20 foot Inter national Organization for Standardization (ISO) container and mounted on a tactical trailer specifically designed for the CK.  During operation this container will be expanded for preparation and serving of the meals.  The CK will consist of the integratio n and manufacture of military designed equipment (cook pot cradle, griddle, tray pack heater, oven, and steam table) and integration and purchase of commercial food service equipment (refrigerator and heated food cabinet) into the ISO container.  This CK w ill also require the integration of environmental controls (heating and A/C) and ventilation systems to support cooks in the ambient working environments of -25 degrees F to 120 degrees F.  A 10 KW tactical quiet generator, six modern burner units (MBU), a nd one MBU power converter will be provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  The system will be transported on the tactical trailer, which has been designed to be capable of transporting 20-foot long ISO containers.  The CK with trailer shall be c ertified for transportation by rail, C130 aircraft and larger, and helicopter sling load.  This CK will have a flexible design allowing for operation on and off the trailer and operation with the 10 KW tactical quiet generator or external power sources.  T he Government procured 284 CKs on a previous contract and is currently fielding them throughout the Army.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) for the new contract will be based a performance specification and provide a drawing package of the current design for  reference purposes only.  The successful business will be able to build, test, and manufacture the Containerized Kitchen in accordance with the performance specification and the Statement of Work.  The Government anticipates that this acquisition will res ult in a single award, utilizing the best value concept, of a firm-fixed-price requirements contract consisting of a basic ordering period with four optional ordering periods, not to exceed 60 months.  It is anticipated that the contractor will fabricate 2  First Article Test (FAT) Units, provide spare and repair parts, and perform first article testing.  The Government will conduct Field Evaluation following acceptance of the First Article Units.  Additional contractor testing may be required on the first p roduction unit to resolve any problems identified during the Government evaluation.  The quantity for the basic ordering period and each optional ordering period is estimated to be between 45 to 50 units.  The Government will also order technical data to i nclude, FAT test plan/report, technical manuals, provisioning data, training documents, and safety documents.  Depending on the response to this synopsis, the CK acquisition may be set aside for small business. The contracting officer's set-aside decision will be based on qualification packages demonstrating the ability to meet the CK requirements. Bear in mind that under a small business set-a side, the prime contractor must perform at least 50% of the cost of manufacturing the CK (excluding the cost of ma terials). For purposes of this acquisition, the small business definition is 500 employees (NAICS 336214). After reading the scope of work above, please respond to the following questions: Can you provide a CSC approved expandable ISO container (either fro m your company directly or through a teaming arrangement)? Please provide a copy of the CSC certificate. 2) What experience or past performance in integrating m obile expandable containers will be used to support your qualification/capabilities? Provide Government references for support.  3) Does your company have experience in kitchen manufacturing and meeting National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) standards?  3) P lease indicate the dollar value your firm is capable of working on considering your current manufacturing schedules and capability. 4) If this project were set-aside for small business, would you submit a bid proposal if in your range? 5) Is your firm a ce rtified HUBZone firm? 6) Is your firm a certified 8(a) firm? Failure to answer any of the above questions may result in a determination of lack of capability for purposes of this survey. Email only responses are requested by 12:00 EDT April 23, 2004 and sh ould be forwarded to Mr. David Condon at David.Condon@natick.army.mil phone number (508) 233- 4995.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Portable Photosynthesis System
<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, intends to enter into a single source contract with Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska.  This contract is to procure a LI-6400 Portable Photosynthesis System.  This equipment is to be used in conjunction with another Government-owned LI-6400 System in the progressive research to select for improved carbon and water flux  which requires accurate measurements of the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis.  Parallel measurements of leaf gas exchange and quantum efficiency requires an instrument equipped with an infrared gas analyzer and a fluorometer and the parallel measurement of gas exchange and fluorescence is required so that in actinic light the leaves do not need to be dark adapted.  This equipment will be used to screen a diverse array of plant materials that differ in tolerances to cold temperature and other environmental stresses, including herbicide damage.  The capacity to take parallel measurements with two LI-6400 systems enables use for paired sampling at the same time.  Data collected must be calculated using the exact same instrumental calculations of leaf photosynthesis and the instruments used must be totally compatible.

<SUBJECT>70 -- SmartBUY
<DESC>FedBizOpps SmartBUY Notice
Discounts and Tiered Pricing



Pursuant to Section 5112 of the Clinger Cohen Act of 1996, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) initiated a federal government-wide software enterprise licensing program called SmartBUY. The SmartBUY program will consolidate the purchasing power of the federal government to obtain optimal pricing and preferred terms and conditions.  The effort was kicked off on June 5, 2003, with the release of the OMB SmartBUY letter to all agencies, designating the General Services Administration (GSA) as the executive agent to lead this initiative.  

GSA intends to make successive improvements in the SmartBUY program, and is starting a tiered pricing and innovative packaging approach using existing GSA Information Technology (IT) Schedule contracts.  Future improvements will be announced in advance as appropriate.

SmartBUY has a five-phased acquisition strategy, beginning with changing federal buying practices and ultimately making enterprise-wide decisions on software titles that satisfy a defined architectural standard.  Phase I has been the use of GSA schedules as they are currently structured.  Phase II allows for restructuring of Federal Supply Service (FSS) Schedule contracts to enable agency buyers to receive the benefit of deeper discounts based on previous cumulative government-wide purchases following the competitive procedures of GSA’s Multiple Award Schedule Program (MAS).  Phase III consolidates agency requirements that have resulted from competitions and provides upfront funding to achieve greater cost avoidance to the government.  Successively, Phase IV aggregates known requirements, forecasts refurbishment of requirements and provides upfront funding.  Phase V competes requirements for government-wide solutions to satisfy a defined architectural standard.  

The purpose of this notice is to announce GSA’s intention to implement Phase II by establishing tiered pricing and quantity discounts with current interested Schedule 70 software contractors.  GSA will publish specific SmartBUY deals in FedBizOpps prior to negotiations to ensure there is visibility in the procurement process.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  For more information, interested parties should contact (the SmartBUY Program Office), (703) 306-7698, thomas.kireilis@gsa.gov or their assigned Federal Supply Schedule IT Schedule Contracting Officer.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEES TO COMMERCIALIZE A PORTABLE CHEMICAL SENSOR
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEES TO COMMERCIALIZE A PORTABLE CHEMICAL SENSOR

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to manufacture and market a portable chemical sensor based on lab-on-a-chip technology. 

The sensor, developed at LLNL, has demonstrated high sensitivity (ppb concentrations) for a variety of substances in aqueous form. Nearly any substance that can be carried in water is directly detectable. It is based on the well-known capillary electrophoresis technique that makes protocol development and validation straightforward. A unique aspect of the LLNL approach is the use of non-fluorescent optical sensing, which eliminates the need for sample derivitization or tagging. Commercial applications include medical and biological research, environmental monitoring, industrial hygiene, and emergency response. Government applications include detection of activities associated with the development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction—chemical, biological, and nuclear. 

The successful industrial partner(s) will be responsible for fabrication of the critical sensor chip, requiring the following MEMS capabilities: etching of microfluidic channels in quartz; embedded optical waveguides; quartz-quartz bonding; and fiber-optic termination. Additionally, the partner(s) will be responsible for fabricating and/or integrating a microfluidic subsystem, lasers, photonic integrated circuits, embedded microcontrollers, electronic interfaces and power supplies, and operating software, into a complete, portable instrument. LLNL will provide substantial guidance in this cooperative partnership.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in developing and commercializing LLNL's chemical sensor technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
	1.	Company Name and address
	2.	The name, address, telephone and fax numbers of a point of contact
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing
	this technology
4.	Statement of your company's potential interest in research partnering 
 

Statements of interest should be sent to: 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization Office, 
P.O. Box 808, L-795, Livermore, CA 94551 
Attention: FBO 72-04 

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is printed to ensure consideration of your response.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation, N00173-04-R-SE04, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2001-22 and DFARS Change Notice 20040323.  The associated small business size standard is 750 employees.  NRL has a requirement for: An Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL) Underwater Acoustic Navigation System that operates in real time with a battery powered programmable transponder at the towfish, and an acoustic array at the ship deployable through a sea chest, moon pool or over the side on a pole and oriented with a GPS receiver, gyroscope and vertical reference unit (VRU). The system shall be “turn-key”, except for the GPS receiver, including all components for operation including spares, cables and connectors. The system will be used with research instruments aboard a variety of ships in a variety of different conditions. To ensure robust operation we require the system to meet or exceed the following specifications of performance, portability, and operation. Although all specifications are important, evaluation will place particular emphasis on performance, proof of performance, ease of installation and operation, and portability. Performance: Accuracy in position should be better than twenty meters over distances (slant ranges) of 4000 meters when the ship is making 4 kts through the water. Accuracy in position should be better than forty meters over distances (slant ranges) of 8000 meters when the ship is making 4 kts through the water. The system shall provide positions when towing a package which is up to 30 degrees off the ship track, and whose horizontal range is twice the depth.All processing shall be performed in real time, and positions displayed graphically on a computer monitor in real time such that the position of the towfish can be continually monitored. Position information shall be provided no less frequently than once every ten seconds. Two towfish transponders shall be provided, (one is to be a spare), one rated to at least 2000 m water depth and the other rated to at least 3000 m water depth. Each must be able to produce signals strong enough at its maximum rated depth to get accurate positions at a rate of once every five seconds for at least 4 days with alkaline batteries. The signal processing should be entirely digital, and an ASCII format log of time (GMT), latitude and longitude shall be available at the end of each deployment. The vendor should provide evidence that the system described here or a nearly identical system has performed (met accuracy specifications above) in a marine environment of at least 1500 m water depth and 2000m horizontal range. Portability: The electronics package (top side processing computer and display computer) should be mounted in its shipping container with handles and removable cover that enables access during operation, and shall not weigh more than 50 kg and not exceed 0.9 m in length, width, or height. The VRU and gyro shall be mounted together, and not weigh more than 25 kg. The VRU shall not exceed 0.5 m in length, width, or height. The transceiver head shall be able to fit through a 12 inch opening to ensure operability on the UNOLS vessels and vessels of opportunity on which the USBL will be deployed. Transponders shall not weigh more than 30 kg, or be longer than 1.2 m, or wider than 0.2 m. All components shall be delivered with water resistant, protective, re-usable shipping containers. Operation: The system shall have completely separate and independent transmit and receive arrays. The transmit array, located on the towfish shall operate autonomously (i.e. battery powered, constant ping interval) without a requirement of power or signal connection to the topside source. The topside receiver array shall connect with a single cable to the topside computer, to ensure signal fidelity and meet tight space requirements on vessels of opportunity. The topside receiver array shall be acoustically compatible with third party transponders, which are frequently used by NRL and other exploration teams. All topside instrumentation shall operate on 50-60Hz 115-240 VAC or 12-24 VDC. The vendor shall supply written instructions on the installation and calibration of the system, and estimates of the time required to perform these procedures. The entire time required for installation and calibration should be less than 24 hrs. The vendor shall supply written instructions on the operation of the system (hardware and software). Operation of the system shall be simple and intuitive enough that a watch stander with minimal seagoing experience can learn to operate the system without formal training classes, using only the manuals provided. Service: The vendor shall be able to install and service, or replace components of the system that become damaged during the course of use within one month of notification. Delivery and acceptance is at Naval Research Laboratory, Stennis Space Center, MS 39529-5004, FOB Destination.  Delivery shall be no later than 120 days from date of award. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items is incorporated. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to that responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers: The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of that provision are 1) Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Governments minimum requirements based on examination of product literature or technical approach narrative. Offerors whom exceed the minimum stated specification requirements will receive scores reflecting a rating above acceptable or neutral; 2) Past Performance; and 3) Price. Technical and past performance, when combined, is of greater importance compared to price. Offeror must complete and submit with its proposal, FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items and DFARs 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items, which are identified as B and available electronically at: http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/reps&certs.htm

Statement of Objectives
Asbestos Database Upgrade 
Altus AFB, Oklahoma

1.       Background
Past building inspections have identified asbestos-containing materials (ACM) in many facilities at Altus AFB (AAFB).     Information developed during past inspections has been input into an in-house database system known as Personal Computer View 3 (PCV3) for managing both asbestos and lead-based paint (LBP).     This database is a DOS based database and is difficult to manage and difficult to input updated information.     Also, the Air Force is moving to incorporate environmental data, including asbestos and lead based paint data, into the ESOMIS database system.     This will occur in the next few years.     The PCV3 database will not allow the current data to transfer into the ESOHMIS database
2.       Objectives
Two major objectives exist for this project: 1) Develop a Microsoft ACCESS database for asbestos and Lead Based Paint and transfer existing data from PCV3 to the new ACCESS database; 2) Provide training to selected Altus AFB personnel on the use and upkeep of the new database..
2.1       Database Conversion
The Base will provide the contractor with a copy of the current PCV3 asbestos and lead based paint database
Contractor will develop an ACCESS database capable of retrieving, updating and manipulating asbestos and LBP information from all facilities surveyed in the 1994-1995 survey.     
Contractor will migrate all information contained in the PCV3 database to the new ACCESS database
Contractor will provide the base with a user?s manual type of instructions for managing the new database.     These instructions shall be in electronic version, allowing the base to reproduce the instructions as necessary.
2.2                  Training
Contractor will provide a one time on site training to selected base personnel.     This training will cover use and management of the asbestos and LBP database
The base will determine which personnel are to receive this training.     All training will be conducted in one session.

3.       Deliverables

Deliverable       Frequency       No of Copies
ACCESS based Asbestos and LBP database       Draft and Final       Base POC       Two (2)

<DESC>Amendment 0003:  The due date of the combination solicitation/synopsis has been extended from 3:00 PM April 8, 2004 to 4:00 PM April 9, 2004.  This synopsis/solicitation is for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.603, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement requests a detailed capabilities statement (technical quote) in addition to a price quote and constitutes the only solicitation; a paper solicitation will not be issued. Request for Quotation number SECHQ1-04-Q-0028 shall be referenced on any capabilities statement (technical quote) and price quote.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC-20 for full and open competition (this competition is unrestricted). All future information about this acquisition including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. This contract action may result in multiple awards, or one single award.  Contracts shall be Firm Fixed Price commercial item Purchase Orders, and may be awarded as a Base Year plus 4 option years.  The Government's requirement is for the following commercially available services:  C.1  Background  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is creating and staffing a new Office of Risk Assessment.  One responsibility of this office is providing means and mechanisms for early and focused identification of companies engaged in fraudulent, illegal or inappropriate (including misleading, opaque, or incomplete) financial reporting.  A companion interest in this objective will be to use risk assessment services or products to identify anomalies in disclosure or financial reporting by public companies subject to the SEC’s disclosure program.  For this purpose, the SEC is seeking computer-based products, services, or software.  Offerors are requested to provide a detailed Capabilities Statement for a commercial product capable of achieving some or all of these objectives. C.2 Scope Commercial products shall be used to identify companies requiring additional inquiry and investigation.  These products shall assist the SEC in identifying changes in financial position or operational results in financial statement presentations not evident in a routine reading of disclosure that may represent material deficiencies in the documents filed by public companies.  C.2.1  The initial focus of this analysis will initially be Forms 10-K (annual reports), 10-Q (quarterly reports), and possibly Form 20-F (foreign private issuers).  C.2.2  Offerors’ commercial products shall provide features such as historic coverage of data related to accounting and audit reports for publicly traded companies.  The commercial products shall have analytical capabilities that signal risk factors.  These tools may provide pre-selected criteria for risk analysis and/or allow for customized measures.  C.3  Objectives  Offerors shall provide commercial products having a flexible user interface and/or reporting capability.  An important performance objective is a high ratio of positive signals (problem companies or reports) to false signals (indications of problems that turn out to be incorrect).  More details in databases and computational platforms are provided in the next section.  C.3.1  Desired characteristics of commercial risk assessment products include the following kinds of evaluations and/or comparisons:  1)Evaluation of a company’s present and past financial data  2)Evaluation of a company’s financial ratios against parameters that may suggest inappropriate financial reporting exists  3)Evaluation of other performance measures that may suggest misleading, opaque or incomplete financial reporting  4)Comparison of a company with peers in an industry group  5)Comparison of a company’s risk evaluation with audit opinions  6)Comparison of a company’s accounting reports with other publicly available SEC information (e.g. litigation releases, accounting and auditing releases, EDGAR filings)  C.3.2  Offerors should address the extent to which financial statements conform to accounting standards, generally accepted industry practices, and the requirements of the federal securities laws and regulations.  C.4  Background and Current Environment  It is anticipated that specific risk assessment requirements and resulting objectives will evolve over time.  Consequently, the commercial products will also evolve in sophistication and complexity over time, especially at a point where there are data content tags for the reports filed with the Commission.  C.4.1 The commercial products shall initially provide for interoperability with respect to the SEC’s enterprise architecture.  The SEC’s current development environment includes 1) reporting tools such as Business Objects, Actuate, Crystal, and Brio; 2) databases such as Sybase ASE and Sybase IQ; 3) the Microsoft suite of tools (Access, Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Project, Visio); 4) development languages such as C, TCL, Java, J2EE, HTML, UML, XML, XSLT, JSP, Struts, and Servlets (used with TomCat as the JSP server for web development); 5) PureEdge to display internet forms; 6) web services technologies such as SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI; 7) Project Version Control System (PVCS) Tracker and PVCS Version Manager for configuration management of automated information systems; 8) Test Director for independent testing; 9) the search engine Autonomy; and 10) firewall and intrusion detection software.  The SEC’s current Technical Infrastructure standards include  A.  Application Servers such as Enterprise Systems:  Sun (Enterprise Servers 4000 series, 4500 series, V880 series, 280 series, E450 series)  Operating Environment:  Solaris 2.8, Sun 4u  Departmental Systems:  Sun (Ultra Sparc series, V120 series, 280 series) Operating Environment:  Solaris 2.8, Sun 4u   Workgroup Systems:  Compaq (File Servers - Proliant ML530, Other Compaq Special purpose servers).  (Migration):  Dell PowerEdge 2550/6450 (Dual Pentium III Processors)  Operating Environment: Microsoft NT Server 4.0  (Migration):  Microsoft Windows 2000 Server (Active Directory)  B.  Web Servers such as  Dell (Various Models), Sun (Enterprise Servers), Dell PowerEdge  Operating Environment:  Windows 2000, Solaris 2.8, Sun 4u  Software:  Netscape Suitespot 3.x, Apache, Microsoft IIS, Tomcat  C.  File Servers such as  Systems:  Dell 1650/2550/2650/6450/6650 (Dual Pentium III Processors)  (Migration):  Compliant Proliant ML360/560/580  Operating Environment: Microsoft NTS 4.0 Server/2000 (Migration):  Microsoft Windows 2003  C.4.2  Vendors shall be required to ensure confidentiality with respect to SEC queries of risk assessment services and the nature of the information derived from such queries and services.  Vendors shall ensure that no details of SEC usage are disclosed to the public, including possibly a prohibition against their disclosing that the SEC is a user of their product, service, or software.  Period of performance shall be for the period of 12 months.  Award is anticipated in May 2004.  The Government intends to issue one or more commercial item purchase orders for the above items to the responsible vendor whose Capabilities Statement /quotation conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors which are in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate quotes: (1) technical acceptability (i.e., reliability and effectiveness of the product being proposed and its compatibility and interoperability with the SEC’s enterprise architecture),  (2) user training, (3) past performance for requirements that are similar to the SEC’s Statement of Objectives (offerors shall provide complete client contact information so that reference checks may be conducted), and (4)price.    If options are awarded, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price of all options to the total price of the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  This evaluation will be based on information provided by the contractor.  The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the Capabilities Statement or quotation, but may do so at its discretion. Only authorized representatives shall submit quotes. Please carefully review the commercial item clauses for information about requirements and instructions for submitting a quotation. Capabilities Statements that do not include prices for all items will not be considered. The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement: Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision 52.212.1, Instructions to Offeror- Commercial Items (OCT 2000); FAR provision 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) - Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer is considered to be most advantageous to the Government, considering technical acceptability, user training, past performance, and price.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions, therefore, it is critical that each quote be fully responsive.  However, the SEC also reserves the right to conduct discussions, if later determined to be necessary, with offerors making the competitive range (i.e., the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for the purposes of efficiency).  Only those offerors determined to be within the competitive range will be invited to present a demonstration of their product to the SEC and will be asked to provide 30 day access to their commercial item product, free of charge, for evaluation purposes.  FAR provision 52-212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) - all offerors shall include a completed copy of this provision with their quote; FAR clause 52-212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions- Commercial Items (FEB 2002); FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (APR 2003) - in paragraph (b) the following clauses apply; 52.203-6 Alternate I, 52.222-3, 52.222-19,52.222.21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37,52.232-33,52.232-36, 52.239-1, 52.222-41,52.222-43, 52.222-44. 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) also applies.
