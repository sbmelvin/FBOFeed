<DESC><strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY -</strong> Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.<br />The Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting information, on behalf of the Protected Resources Division of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for research equipment necessary to continue monitoring migrating fish species in coastal waters in Maine.
<p>BACKGROUND<br />NOAA Fisheries Service is dedicated to protecting and preserving our nation's living marine resources and their habitat through scientific research, management and enforcement. In 2000, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service established the Maine Field Station in Orono, ME to have more direct involvement in the conservation of the living marine resources in Maine, particularly Atlantic salmon. NOAA Fisheries Service shares jurisdiction of Atlantic salmon with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) at the federal level. Within Maine, NOAA Fisheries Service primarily focuses on fish in the estuarine and marine environment, while the Maine Department of Marine Resources and USFWS focus on the freshwater life stages. NOAA Fisheries Service also works closely with other federal agencies (particularly the U.S. Geological Survey), the University of Maine System and a wide range of state, academic, public and private partners. <br />For years scientists have struggled to understand the decline and slow recovery of Atlantic salmon, a once abundant and highly prized game and food fish native to New England Rivers. Biologists agree that poor marine survival is affecting salmon in the U.S. and Canada, but specific causes are difficult to determine in the ocean. Small acoustic tags and associated technology may provide some answers. The acoustic transmitters or "tag", which are about the size of the silver eraser holder on a pencil, are surgically implanted in salmon smolts that are six to seven inches in length. Each tag has a unique identification code that transmits an ultrasonic signal every few seconds. To detect these tags locally, NEFSC maintains a network of nearly 100 acoustic receivers that extend from Brewer, on the Penobscot River near Bangor, into the Gulf of Maine. When a fish swims near a receiver, its identity and the date and time of detection is recorded by the receiver. Once data is downloaded for the season, biologists can learn which route each fish took, how long it took to get to the Gulf of Maine and most importantly, which fish survived and where fish that did not exit the Penobscot River may have died. This information can help uncover the causes of mortality. Beyond the Gulf of Maine and since 2008, more than 10% of Atlantic salmon smolts tagged by NOAA's Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) in Maine's Penobscot River and released in Brewer, Maine in mid-May have crossed a line of underwater receivers off Halifax, Nova Scotia, the first fish to be tracked using the new global Ocean Tracking Network.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS<br />The Contractor shall provide research equipment necessary to continue monitoring migrating fish species in coastal waters in Maine. The Contractor shall provide equipment which will work interchangeably with existing gear (transmitters and receivers) from Vemco, a division of Amirix, as well as the software and systems listed below:</p>
<p>&bull; Receivers 69 KHz - Code Map 112: VR2W and VR100);<br />&bull; Transmitters (69 KHz: V7, V8, V9, V9AP, V13 and V16);<br />&bull; Data analysis software (Visual Understanding Environment (VUE)) and<br />&bull; Access database systems that are currently owned and used by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center</p>
<p>This equipment will be required to work with the existing infrastructure of equipment and software systems. In addition; this equipment will be used collaboratively with Canadian scientists in Department of Fisheries and Oceans and Atlantic Salmon Federation, and the University of Maine Orono/USGS as part of an integrated international monitoring system providing additional rationale for standardization.<br />Transmitters (69KHz) supplied must be detectable by the current array of 130 receivers (69KHz-Code Map 112) that exist as a part of existing telemetry infrastructure. <br />This ultrasonic array has been in place seasonally since 1996, with some portions of the array within the Gulf of Maine in the water continuously. These units will be networked with international research efforts as part of the global Ocean Tracking Network. To utilize this network NOAA needs transmitters annually that are detectable by the existing network. Implanting these transmitters allows researchers to understand mortality, behavior and movement of Atlantic salmon smolts each year and compare between years. The VR2W receivers that are a part of this order will be used to replace units that are in need of repair or lost during deployment and to add to overall capability. These receivers allow researchers to monitor transmitter tagged fish from fixed locations for several months without the constant supervision that is required by other receivers that are used to track transmitters.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLES<br />The Contractor shall provide equipment comparable to the following list of equipment:</p>
<p>1) 10 each - VR2 (Delrin; black case) trade-in for upgrade to VR2W <br />Delivery to be on or before August 31, 2010</p>

<DESC><p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> <br />The Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting quotes, on behalf of the Protected Resources Division of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for a priority research project relative to Atlantic Sturgeon in the James River. <br /><br />The primary objectives of this study are to gather data on the migration patterns and habitat utilization of Atlantic sturgeon in the James River. A temporal and spatial description of sturgeon movement and habitat occupation is needed. It is necessary for this information to be presented in Geospatial (GIS) analysis to determine life stage specific trends. Also, tracks will need to be integrated into high-resolution benthic maps to further resolve habitat use where possible. A secondary objective focuses on identifying potential spawning habitat by overlaying adult tracks in the spring and fall with the benthic maps of the James River. Another objective of this study would be to continue population monitoring. This would include the continuation of a relative abundance survey in the James so that population abundance trends can be accurately determined. Data to support the description of critical population parameters, including abundance, age, size structure, and growth will be collected including tissue samples for genetics. Mark and recapture efforts in the James will be continued and the information presented in any interim and final reports to NMFS. If additional funding is available to continue this work over the course of four option years, this will allow for a very robust population monitoring program that will provide needed data to develop a population estimate for the James River subpopulation which is critical to recovery efforts. Tasks to be completed include the following: 1) Continue to deploy the sonic array consisting of 40-45 receivers in this area and maintain it for at least one additional year. This array will stretch from the lower James River near river mile 28 (Burwell Bay) to river mile 75 (Rockets deep water terminal), and it will provide 24 hour remote tracking year round. 2) Some gill net sampling will be conducted to continue population monitoring efforts in order to gather information necessary for developing a robust population estimate for the James River subpopulation. From this sampling effort, at least five additional sturgeon will be implanted with transmitters (using VEMCO V16 transmitters or a similar type), tracked using the VEMCO array (existing and augmented by 2 new VR2W wireless passive receivers), and released. 3) Subsequent tracks from the over sixty fish that are carrying transmitters will be examined by life stage (adults&gt;1550mmTL, sub adults&lt;1150 and YOY&lt;550mm) for habitat use patterns to identify temporal and spatial migration trends and patterns in habitat occupation. This information will be displayed in GIS maps. 4) Adult tracks in the spring will be cross referenced with benthic habitat maps to determine potential spawning habitats and this information shared with other partners who are leading spawning habitat restoration efforts. 5) Habitat use patterns will be examined by life stage (adult/sub-adult) and river mile to determine guidelines for time/area regulations and improved area based abundance models. This information will be displayed in GIS maps. 6) Migration patterns will be examined for temporal and spatial trends as well as relationships with physical parameters such as temperature, moon cycle and potentially tide levels. This information will be displayed in GIS maps.<br /><br />This is a full and open solicitation. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 813312. <br /><br />NOAA anticipates 1 contract award as a result of this solicitation. The solicitation and proposed fixed price contract will be issued utilizing the test procedures identified in FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program For Certain Commercial Items and will be evaluated on a best value basis wherein the following non-price factors (Factors 1 and 2), listed in descending order of importance, when combined, are significantly more important than price (Factor 3): Factor 1 - Experience, Factor 2 - Past Performance, Factor 3- Price. <br /><br />All responsible sources may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency. To be eligible for award, vendors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR): www.ccr.gov and obtain a DUNS number by calling 1-800-333-0505. Prospective contractors are also required to complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with the required CCR registration. A copy of the solicitation is attached to this announcement as a downloadable Word file. <strong>Quotes will be due on August 2, 2010 by 4:00 P.M. </strong>A hard copy of the solicitation will be provided in response to a written or faxed request received directly from the requestor. Telephone requests for hard copies will not be honored. Requests for hard copies of the solicitation may be faxed to (757) 664-3640. Quotes will be accepted electronically at the following email address: Timothy.Wampler@noaa.gov and via facsimile at (757) 664-3640.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will be issued via the US EPA RTP website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.
The solicitation number is PR-NC-10-10587 and the solicitation is being issued as full and open competition using FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-37. 
The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541380 and the Small Business Size Standard is $12 Million.  An indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation with a 12 month base period of performance and three (3) 12 month option periods.  The IDIQ contract will consist of a minimum of 1,875 samples (7,500 analytes) and a maximum of 14,240 samples (56,960 analytes) for the life of the contract.
EPA has a requirement to perform nutrient analyses in water of varying salinity. During the period of performance of this contract samples (consisting of 4 analytes per sample) will be shipped to the contractor.   Approximately 90% of the samples will be from the water column (river, estuary, coastal ocean); the remaining 10% will be water of high nutrient (HN) content; this will commonly be interstitial water collected from within sediments but may be other waters as well.  All the water column and high nutrient samples may require results for up to 4 analytes (nitrate+nitrite, ammonium, orthophosphate, and silicate).  Interstitial water samples will be delivered to the analytical laboratory particle free and in the frozen state.  
The matrices of the water column and interstitial water samples could range from fresh water to ~32 psu.  The matrix attributes and analytes would be specified, by sample, in the shipping information. 
Samples will be shipped in batches of between 25 and 300 samples.
Refer to the statement of work for more details regarding this procurement, including associated deliverables
This procurement will be awarded on a best value basis per the following evaluation criteria (in order of importance):   (i) TECHNICAL: 1.)Demonstration of Minimum Qualification Requirements:  (a) Lab management or personnel with at least 1 year experience analyzing seawater samples for the 4 nutrients at concentrations as low as the low end of the standardization range in the Statement of Work, Section 3.c.(1);  (b) Ability to meet the 3-week minimum turn around requirement for the duration of the study (Statement of Work, Section 4);(c) Ability to perform the 4 analyses with a minimum of 15 ml of sample;  
2.) Demonstration of evidence of participation in any state or federal laboratory certification programs, or a list of at least 2 publications in marine science journals that have used nutrient data provided by them;  3.) Submission of an electronic version of what the offeror would consider a "Quality Assurance Manual" that is used to support the routine quality of its data; this document shall be in a Word (.doc) or Portable Document Format (.pdf) format; 
4.) Offerors shall submit a response to the question, "How does your laboratory deal with samples of varying salinities (that are approximately known) when performing nutrient analyses?" and if 'matching the salinity matrix of samples' is necessary for your instrumentation, answer the question, "How close does the standard matrix need to be to the sample matrix?";  
5.) Offerors shall submit a response to the question, "How does your laboratory deal with samples of widely varying concentrations (see Section 3.c.(1) of the Statement of Work for possible ranges) such as those that may be found in a batch of samples that contain interstitial water samples (high ammonia) and fresh water (high silicate)?"  Would dilution and reanalysis following an initial determination be the strategy and would there be an additional charge for each sample requiring this treatment to obtain values within the instrument calibration? 
(ii) PAST PERFORMANCE: Submit a list of at least 3 clients who have submitted seawater samples for analysis within the past 3 years.  Include specific individuals to contact and their phone numbers.  (Past performance will be evaluated as follows: quality of product or service, timeliness of performance - ability to adhere to deadlines, and overall customer satisfaction); (iii) PRICE 
The following FAR provisions shall apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items, 52.223-13, Certification of Toxic Chemical Release Reporting, 52.233-2, Service of Protest.

The contractor shall recommend or provide specialized control components, actuators, switches or bypass components that are not readily available in the marketplace. Additionally, the contractor shall provide calibration services to ensure the completed system delivers water at volume and temperature necessary to sustain aquatic life in the various environments. 
3. The contractor must work closely with science staff to fully develop and implement the controls system.
B.  The System:
1. Anticipated system output will be between 40 and 60 gallons per minute at 22 to 28 centigrade. 
2. The following list of parts are provided for utilization.
3. System Components: (These components are already on hand and will be used to construct the water temperature control system)
a.  Two 3,000-gallon capacity round poly tanks approximately 96" (2.4 meter) in diameter, 110" (2.8 meter) tall
b. Six  Sondex S9A-IG10-10TK liquid heat exchangers with the following specifications:
- Height  <30" (76.2 centimeter)- Width < 18" (45.7 centimeter)- Length <21" (53.3 centimeter)- Flow Rate: Hot Side 45gpm, Cold Side: 40 gpm- Max design temp: 250 F- Max working pressure: 150 psi- Plate material: AISI 316- Number of plates: 10 expandable to 60- Connections: 2.5" (6.35 centimeter) both hot and cold sides
C.  System End Requirements:
1. The system's first set of heat exchangers will draw heat from the existing building hot water loop, which contains ethylene glycol.  The building loop operates at approximately 180 F (82 C) and 15 - 20 psi.  Output at the warm water loops will be adjustable. Tank loops will be set up to function as one large (22 - 24 C) (72 - 75 F) or two smaller (22 - 24 C and 25 - 28C) (72 - 75 and 77 - 82 F) temperature at aquaria.
2. System will have a 2" (5.08 centimeter) primary warm water line and a secondary 1" (2.54 centimeter) warm water line. Both lines will be schedule 80 and be approximately 300' (91 meter) in length.
3. Wetable construction materials muct not contain brass bronze or copper.  If metal parts are specified, they will be 316 stainless steel.
4. End stage distribution pumps shall be sized to maintain 40 psi at 40 to 60--gpm flow rate.
5. Water loops back from laboratory rooms through the reheat exchangers (3a and 3b on drawing) so flow at return tank can be adjusted to control line pressure with manual or actuated valve.
6. PC monitoring to include at a minimum: water temperature at aquaria and alarm conditions.
D.  Design Considerations:
1. Fill system:  The fill system shall be designed with fail-safe protections from overfill and from dry run conditions.  Tanks shall be fitted with redundant overfill protection and alarm system.  All alarm points in the system system must provide low voltage dry contacts so they can be integrated with existing building automation/alarm systems.
2. The Contractor shall provide a tank level contol device design and specification.
3.  Pipe fitting and component installation will be accomplished by laboratory personnel utilizing design schematics developed by the contractor.  The contractor shall conduct an on site evaluation and system start-up after construction. 
E.  Fail Safes:
1.  The contractor shall ensure the following fair safe meaures are met:
a. System does not provide over heated soft water to aquariab. Systems does not allow tanks to floodc. System does not allow pumps to run dryd. System alarms if bypass valves faile. System alarms when preset temperatures are out of range
Firms that believe they can provide the required services described in the attached Statement of Work must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the services by submitting the following documentation:
1. Technical Experience. Firms shall address their expertise in aquatic life support systems/tempered water system.  
2. Firms shall also provide resumes of technical personnel who will be performing the services.
Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for North America Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 541330 which is $4.5 Million.
