This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.

Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

<p>Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Huntsville is issuing a solicitation to add the attached list of items that are sole source to The Boeing Company to contract SPRPA1-14-D-002U, a multiple year, Requirements Type Contract (RTC). The solicitation is intended to be on a sole source basis using Other Than Full and Open Competition as prescribed by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The ordering periods include a five (5) year base period and a five (5) year option period for a potential duration of ten (10) years. The contract type is Fixed Price. This acquisition will include Depot Level Reparable (DLR) items managed by the U.S. Army. The items are categorized in multiple Federal Supply Classes (FSC) and ordered by National Stock Number (NSN). A population of 28 NSNs will be solicited.</p>
<p>Alternate offers must submit a complete technical data package for each NSN for approval in order to be considered. Any items found to be competitive after award of the contract or become competitive after award, will be removed from the contract. Items in the solicitation population are sole source to The Boeing Company, CAGE code 0PXV4 and 48T42; however, this may expand after contract award. Items are FOB Origin with inspection/acceptance at origin. DLRs may be shipped from Boeing to a customer within the Continental United States (CONUS) if required as well as FMS orders. The NSNs, part numbers, and annual estimated quantities for the initial population are available in the attached Identification of Requirements (IOR). Any supplies to be furnished under this resulting contract will be ordered by issuance of a delivery order.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM); therefore, if any non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date. Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. In addition, respondents should identify quantity available and price. The Government may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors must meet prequalification requirements in order to be eligible for award. Firms that recognize and can produce the required item described above are encouraged to identify themselves. Firms are encouraged to seek source approval in order to compete for future solicitations by accessing the website http://amcomdmz.redstone.army.mil/casl_cmo/casl_cmo_home and looking under Standardized Aviation and Missile Source Approval Request (SAMSAR). All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. The closing date annotated is an estimated date and may be adjusted dependent upon the date of release for solicitation; however, the solicitation will not close prior to the date stated above. Foreign Firms are reminded that all requests for solicitation must be processed through their respective embassies.</p>

<p>The solicitation document contains information that has been designated as "Militarily Critical Technical Data".

All requests for copies of the solicitation document must include a certified copy of DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement. To obtain certification, contact: Commander, Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), ATTN: U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084 or call DLIS at (800) 352-3572.

<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Various increments solicited: 12-17, 18-24, and 25-30.</p>

<DESC>AG-0343-S-16-0036<br />Project Title: Custer Gallatin National Forest - Main Fork Rock Creek Road-2421 Reconstruction, Phase I
<p>Description of Work: <br />This project consists of reconditioning approximately 2.92 miles of the Main Fork Rock Creek Road #2421 and constructing new turnouts along the road. The work includes, clearing &amp; grubbing, decking merchantable timber, excavation and embankment, borrow excavation and haul, turnout construction, road reconditioning, surfacing, culvert removal and replacement, sign installation, seeding, traffic control, and various other items related to the road work on the Main Fork Rock Creek Road #2421. Additionally, the project includes blading, shaping, and surfacing MK Campground Road #2421C.</p>
<p>The successful Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment (fully operated), supervision, transportation, operating supplies, and incidentals necessary to complete the work. All work shall conform to the Plans, Drawings, and Specifications in the solicitation and any resultant contract.</p>
<p>Project Location: <br />Main Fork Rock Creek Road #2421 is located along the Beartooth Hwy 212 on the Beartooth Ranger District, Custer Gallatin National Forest near Red Lodge, Montana. The project begins at the pavement/gravel transition of the Main Fork Rock Creek Road #2421 and proceeds for approximately 4 miles. There may be limited work prior to the gravel portion of the road.</p>
<p>&bull; Note: The project area/Beartooth Highway are seasonally restricted access areas due to snow/weather conditions. Because of the high altitudes, snowstorms can occur even in the middle of the summer and the pass is also known for strong winds and severe thunderstorms. Work operations can only take place from approximately June through September.</p>
<p>Price Range: Between $250,000 and $500,000. A Firm-Fixed Price contract is expected to result from this solicitation.<br /><br />Pre-bid Tour: No pre-bid tour will be conducted. Contractors are urged to inspect the site where the work will be performed. Interested parties may contact the Beartooth Ranger District Office, at 406-446-2103, for directions to view the project site on their own. Interested parties may contact Dave Shimek, at 406-255-1422, with technical questions related to the project.</p>
<p>Interested parties shall take reasonable steps to ascertain the nature and location of the project area and the work to be completed, as well as the general and local site conditions which can affect the work and cost of performance. Failure to take the actions described in this paragraph will not relieve the Contractor from the responsibility of properly estimating the difficulty and cost to successfully perform the work, or from successful completion of the work without additional expense to the Government.<br /><br />The solicitation will be available on approximately 15 April 2016, and can be downloaded from this website at that time.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement for additional labor effort to demonstrate the utility and value of systems vaccinology for malaria vaccine development with the benefits of established non-human primate (NHP) model systems, validated assays for in-depth immune profiling, and established computational infrastructures for large scale systems biology data analysis and modeling.
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The NIAID intends to modify contract #HHSN272201200031C, with Emory University, entitled "An Integrated Approach to Understanding Host-Pathogen Interactions" to increase the quantity of labor hours delivered to the Government by 7,800 hours through the remainder of the current contract. This contract was awarded using full and open competition, with an initial Base Period of September 30, 2012 to September 29, 2013; and included four one-year Option Periods for a total potential performance period through September 29, 2017. The total potential value of the contract, inclusive of Options, is $19,458,981.</p>
<p>This research and development effort aims to demonstrate the utility and value of systems vaccinology for malaria vaccine development utilizing experiments with established NHP model systems and irradiation attenuated P. cynomolgi sporozoites to identify molecular signatures associated with immunity and protection. This work will build upon the large body of systems biology data generated under the existing contract regarding natural course of infection, immunity and pathogenesis in Macaca mulatta (rhesus monkeys) infected with P. cynomolgi sporozoites (multiple strains) as a model for the widespread human malaria pathogen, P. vivax; assays and panels established and validated on the existing contract for in-depth immune profiling, including panels for assessing cellular phenotypes in macaques, innate cells and multiplex cytokine assays with a panel of custom-defined molecules; and ready access to cohorts of healthy malaria na&iuml;ve rhesus macaques on a daily basis and at selected times for blood testing of clinical, parasitological and immune response parameters. This work will consist of experiments that involve immunizing Macaca mulatta with irradiation-attenuated P. cynomolgi sporozoites to identify molecular&nbsp;signatures associated with immunity and protection. Clinical baseline, immunization and post-challenge data using multiple high-throughput omics technologies will be generated. Omics data analysis and integration will be performed as well as in-depth immune profiling to assess changes in frequencies and activation status of approximately 30 cellular subsets comprised of neutrophils, monocytes, Bcells, dendritic cells, and Tcells.</p>
<p>This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. Emory University possesses the facilities, resources, and expertise that make it uniquely qualified to perform this work. Having developed an extensive systems biology infrastructure for running longitudinal studies using an established Plasmodium cynomolgi infected rhesus macaque model, with established mathematical and computational models and iterative experimentation capabilities, experiments conducted under the existing contract have produced unique, specific data allowing for retrospective analyses and iterative experimentation to manipulate a spectrum of host immune responses. No other source has been found that possesses all the necessary elements to perform the services in a way that would satisfy NIAID's requirements. Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the&nbsp;Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement. A Research and Development Sources Sought Notice was posted on November 13, 2015 as HHS-NIH-NIAID-RDSS-16-NIHAI2016HP1.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Interested parties may contact the points of contact referenced in this announcement.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted. Specifically, Cyro is the only contractor in the NIH main campus vicinity that may provide the requested. Additional transferring of the samples can pose risk to the intergiruty of the samples and ultimately the continuity of science. Maintaining transgenic animal strains is more and more expensive each year. The number of these strains is also increasing as more innovative mechanism for manipulating gene are developed. As a consequence many laboratories at NIH use transgenic animals in their research projects. The NIMH Transgenic core facility is tasked with cryopreserving these lines as a cheaper alternative to keeping them in animal holding facilities in numbers that will guarantee their survival.

<CONTACT>GARTZKE, JENNIFER
<DESC>The NPS entered into a sole source procurement with Aramark Sports and Entertainment.  This contract action was issued under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(I) - Soliciting from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available, i.e. urgency.  Period of Performance is March 27, 2016 to May 10, 2016.

Fire Fighter I/II Course March 27, 2016 to April 9, 2016

Fire Apparatus Driver Operator Class April 24, 2016 to May 7, 2016


This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  No solicitation document exists and no telephone inquiries will be accepted.  Inquiries will only be accepted by email to Albert_Phillips@nps.gov.  The contracting officer has determined that competition would not be practicable for this one time requirement, and soliciting on a sole source basis to Aramark is in the best interest of the government because of the pending start of the 2016 fire season.  Aramark has provided these services to the NPS under IDIQ contract P12PC20168, but the contract expired before a task order could be issued for this class and the government has not had time to compete a new IDIQ for these services.  A new IDIQ will be solicited to meet future needs, but due to the urgency of having properly trained fire crews for the upcoming fire season, it is critical that this training class be held before the fire season starts so the NPS is adequately prepared to fight what could be a busy, dangerous and costly fire season.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to award two modifications to a delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N61340-12-G-0001 to L-3 Communications Corporation, Link Simulation and Training Division (L-3) Company for the procurement of Software Configuration Set/Operational Flight Program (SCS/OFP) software for installation on all F/A-18 C/D Tactical Operational Flight Trainers (TOFTs) and SimuStrike devices as well as Deficiency Report (DR) corrections as a result of previous SCS/OFP Government testing. The effort is to upgrade the Microsoft Windows 10 Operating Systems on the F/A-18 C/D training systems and to procure two (2) new Simustrikes in the 29C configuration.
 As the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the F/A-18 C/D TOFT SCS/OFP software, L-3 is the only source capable of providing the SCS/OFP software. 

Award to any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling F/A-18 mission training requirements. This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. (c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements). No solicitation documents are available. This notice of intent is neither a request for competitive proposals nor a solicitation of offers.
 Matters pertaining to this notification may be directed to Tann Perrault at 407-380-4723 or via email at Trang.Perrault@navy.mil.

ORIGIN. NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) intends to solicit the Boeing Company (81205) for the purchase of items associated with the P-8A Poseidon
aircraft platform. NAVSUP WSS' intention is to award a Firm Fixed Price
contract. Although the Navy intends in the future to obtain competition wherever feasible for the subject items (generally referred to as common commercial
parts), key logistics/support data essential to competition is not currently
available. Specifically, essential provisioning data and engineering/technical  data necessary for manufacture and acceptance of the subject parts (initially   developed for the 737 aircraft by Boeing Commercial Aircraft or its commercial  sub-vendors) is not available to the Navy. In addition, Critical Safety Item
(CSI)/Critical Application Item (CAI) determinations for the P-8A continue to be made and life limits assessed, including for commercial common parts. Given such circumstances, at present, purchases of the listed items will only be made from Boeing the airframe manufacturer, from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), or from authorized distributors (if any) to assure parts integrity given the
P-8A's critical mission and early deployment status. Sources sought:
Notwithstanding the current constraints requiring procurement as noted, once
CSI/CAI determinations are made, and where other necessary engi
neering/technical data becomes available, the Navy will be actively seeking in  the future to maximize the opportunity for competition presented by P-8A comm   ercial common parts. In that regard the following should be noted. The P-8 A is not FAA type certificated. New sources for items determined to be CSI/C AI will therefore require Navy Source Approval prior to award. If you are not a
Navy-approved source, when in the future the Navy has sufficient
engineering/technical data to accept and evaluate source approval requests, you will have to submit, prior to or together with any proposal, the information
detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Brochure which can be obtained on the internet at: https://www.nasup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navsupww/business_opps.  Future offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source
Approval Brochure will not be considered for award. Please note, if evaluation  of a source approval request submitted cannot be processed in time and/or the   approval requirement precludes the ability to obtain the items being procured in time to meet Government requirements, award of the procurement may be continued based on Fleet support needs. For information or questions regarding this
notice, please contact Dana Scott at the email address: dana.scott@navy.mil.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, Network Contracting Office 4 (NCO4) intends to solicit proposals from contractors in the Philadelphia, PA VA Medical Center catchment area which includes the counties of:  Bucks, Montgomery, Delaware, and Philadelphia in Pennsylvania; and Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester counties in New Jersey for provision of community nursing home services at the contractors' facilities under Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs).   See the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 16.

The VA anticipates issuing a solicitation for this requirement in middle to late April 2016.  Proposals will be accepted for 30 day period after the issuance date of the solicitation however it may remain open longer until all requirements are fulfilled.  Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of the solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from the FBO website as no hard copies will be made available.  The solicitation will provide instructions to contractors regarding the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.  

In accordance with FAR 52.204-7, System for Award Management, prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) under the applicable NAICS to be eligible for award of a BOA.  Firms may obtain SAM information at https://www.sam.gov .  Registration is free and potential offerors are encouraged to visit the SAM website as no BOAs can be awarded to any offeror not registered in SAM.

The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 623110 (Nursing Care Facilities) with a Small Business Size Standard of $27.5M.  The classification code is Q402.  The solicitation will be issued for full and open competition.  Multiple awards are anticipated and will be made on an as needed basis.

The VA will only consider proposals from contractors who are insured and licensed by their respective States and who are Medicare/Medicaid qualified.  Other criteria will be described in the solicitation package.  

VA placements are made in contracted nursing homes based on availability of facilities and the desires of eligible Veterans and their respective families.  Because it is impossible to determine actual usage of any particular contract facility, the VA employs BOAs with no guaranteed minimums.  

Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist using the e-mail link provided.  Telephone requests for information or questions will NOT be accepted.  Please email requests or questions to Herb Byrns at the following e-mail address:  Herbert.byrns@va.gov and ensure that the subject line includes:  Solicitation # VA244-16-R-0173

Additionally, a 149 SM covered building will be constructed to house fire suppression pumping systems to allow open fuel tank maintenance in one hangar. The facility should be compatible with applicable DoD, Air Force, and base design standards. In addition, local materials and construction techniques shall be used where cost effective. The restoration/alteration will be designed as permanent construction in accordance with the DoD Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC 1-200-01). Re-work of the facility includes constructing office areas, conference and break rooms, information technology (IT) server rooms, and restricting areas using framing, walls, utilities, detection/protection features, and security enhancements. The taxi/parking ramps will be replaced to support increased aircraft loads. Supporting facilities include all associated utilities, site work, communication support, pavements, parking area, environmental remediation, and demolition. This project will comply with DoD antiterrorism/force protection requirements per UFC 4-010-01.</p>
<p>The project is located on an airfield-access is controlled and airfield requirement will be in effect. This project is a two-phase design-build solicitation. The solicitation criteria relies upon industry standards, where allowable, to afford the offeror a degree on design flexibility while meeting certain specific project requirements. The successful Contractor must design and construct complete and useable facilities, as described in the RFP documents. One solicitation will be issued covering both phases. Phase-One is the pre-selection phase (this phase does not include the submission of a price proposal). Evaluation factors under Phase-One may consist of the following: Past Performance Information of the Prime Construction Contractor; Past Performance Information of the Lead Design Firm; Key Personnel Experience and Qualifications on projects of similar nature (similar or greater scope and complexity and technical sophistication) including Construction personnel and Design personnel. Proposals will be evaluated in Phase-One to determine which offerors will submit proposals for Phase-Two and an amendment will be issued to those selected offerors (maximum of five). The detailed project performance requirements for this project will be included in the Requests for Proposals (RFP) package (Phase-Two). Evaluation factors for Phase Two may consist of the following: Design Narrative (Architectural; HVAC System; Structural); Ability to schedule/execute work on multiple projects/buildings simultaneously in an expedited timeframe and limited workspace; Environmental Compliance; Sustainable Design; Quality of Proposal Submittal; Small Business Participation Plan; and a Price Proposal. Phase -Two proposal evaluation ratings alone will be used to determine the most advantageous proposal to the Government. Basis of award is Best Value "Trade-off." Award of the Design-Build contract will be made to one of the five firms, which, in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, provides the best combination of design features and cost/price reasonableness. In making this determination, all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. The Government reserves the right to make award to other than the lowest price offeror, price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of this project is greater than $70,000,000.00.<br /><br />The Period of Performance is 730 calendar days from Notice to Proceed.<br /><br />Sub-contracting plans are required for all construction contracts awarded to a large business when the award amount exceeds $1,500,000.00.

<p>5. Explain how you would ship/deliver and install the ballistic glass shielding to recruiting locations across all 50 states of the United States, Puerto Rico, and Guam (SoN paragraph 3.1.2.).</p>
<p>6. Due to the fact every office has a unique layout, explain how you will mitigate unknowns due to variations in facility floor plans/set-up.</p>
<p>7. Explain how you will ensure the installation of the ballistic solution will meet ADA and code requirements.</p>
<p>8. Installation of the ballistic shielding must not interfere with the facilities' normal operations, specifically foot traffic, furniture layout, seating area, etc. Explain how you will handle this.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
<p>I. Description of Intent <br />This Notice is to gauge the availability of vendors that are capable and interested in satisfying the Government's requirement for reset, sustainment and maintenance parts to support 296 Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) Talons, also known as the Directed Requirement Talons (DR), 62 Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Talons, 600 Man Transportable Robotic System/Explosive Ordnance Disposal (MTRS/EOD) Talons and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) for the Program Executive Office Combat Support and Combat Support Systems (PEO CS&amp;CSS) Project Manager Force Projection (PM FP), and the United States Marine Corp (USMC), under PM FP Robotics Logistics Support Center (RLSC). <br /><br />II. General Information: <br />PM FP Robotics Logistics Support Center (RLSC) is issuing a Sources Sought Notice as means of conducting market research only to identify parties having interest and resources to support this requirement. The information gained will be used for preliminary planning and to determine the availability of qualified contractors to see if any other means of procuring the Government's requirement for reset, sustainment and maintenance parts which includes the entire Bill of Materials (BOM) for every TALON robot variant. The information received will be used by the Government to facilitate the decision-making process and will not be disclosed outside of the agency. If a solicitation is issued subsequent to this notice, information received from respondents will aid in the decision of whether to issue a solicitation as a competitive set-aside for qualified Small Businesses, Vendors with GSA Schedules or whether to issue the requirement as unrestricted full and open competition. The Government assumes no financial responsibility for cost incurred with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. <br /><br />This Notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research. Respondents will not be notified of the results regarding the market research survey.<br />This notice is to determine if there are any other sources outside of Foster Miller the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the Talon Robot. They are the OEM of the Talon parts to include the drawings that they developed and they own the intellectual property for the Talon system. The Government did not fund any portion of the Technical Data Package (TDP); therefore, it only has limited rights to the technical data. Without acquiring or developing a TDP, all other sources could only provide the standardized and universal components, which represent 10% of the items needed to sustain the platforms. The other 90% of items are unique to Talon. Any ensuing contract would be firm-fixed price with a period of performance of five years from the date of award.<br /><br />The parts to be procured are identified on the Master Parts List (MPL) which consists of the Talon BOM and will be incorporated into the contract. The contractor shall ensure that delivered spare parts comply in all respects with the manufacturer's performance requirements for each part number. The initial MPL shall be updated by the vendor to ensure complete accuracy of the entire BOM, part numbers and nomenclatures. In the future, the MPL shall be updated by the Government as needed for part numbers or nomenclature after approval of the PM office. The Talon system is a 115 pound all-terrain, rugged, tracked robot used in the detection and disposal of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and other explosives.</p>
<p>The genesis of this requirement came from the Man Transportable Robotic System Increment II (MTRS Inc. II) Bridging Strategy-Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM), dated 10 March 2014, which directed a quantity of 296 Talon Gen IV robotic systems (originally acquired for Theater operations) to be retained by RLSC. The ADM further directed the items to be reset to 10/20 standard with long term sustainment and maintenance for current and future use by Global Response Force (GRF) missions and Army Contingency Force (ACF) missions. <br /><br />III. Submission Instructions: <br />All responding to this notice shall provide specific information to include a summary of their Company's capabilities.<br /><br />Information to be provided shall include a Capability Statement which demonstrates the skills, experience, knowledge, and capabilities necessary to meet the Government's requirement for reset, sustainment and maintenance parts to support 296 Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) Talons, also known as the Directed Requirement Talons (DR), 62 Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Talons, 600 Man Transportable Robotic System/Explosive Ordnance Disposal (MTRS/EOD) Talons and Foreign Military Sales (FMS). Statements should address the contractor ability to obtain the relevant Master Parts List, and satisfy the Government's requirement for reset, sustainment and maintenance parts. The contractor shall address how it plans to ensure that the delivered spare parts comply in all respects with the manufacturer's performance requirements for each part number and it's plan for communicating with the Government regarding any required updating of the MPL as needed for part numbers or nomenclature to ensure a complete BOM. The contractor response should list the firm's specific skills, experience, knowledge, and capabilities to complete these requirements, including, but not limited to a description of corporate experience with similar projects.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="BACKGROUND: white; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">BACKGROUND</span></span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"> </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><br />The National Institute on Aging (NIA) has a need for a project entitled, The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span Home Visit Program (HHVP). Health disparities are marked differences or inequalities in health measures, such as disability or mortality, between two or more population groups based on race or ethnicity, gender, education, socioeconomic status (SES), or other criteria. Health disparities among ethnic minorities, the poor, and the medically underserved are well documented nationally and internationally. From perspective of the National Institute on Aging (NIA), understanding health disparities is linked to understanding aging because health disparities are characteristically seen in commonly occurring age-associated diseases such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease as well as diabetes mellitus and cancer. The challenge to investigating health disparities and minority aging is designing and implementing studies that recruit and retain a racially and socioeconomically diverse cohort. Unfortunately, the failure to consistently include minority and socioeconomically diverse research participants has hampered efforts to address disparate health outcomes and conduct successful translational research in many areas of clinical research. With this background, the NIA developed the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study to investigate whether race and socioeconomic status influence health and age-related health disparities separately or synergistically as co-factors of behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">HANDLS is a prospective population-based interdisciplinary, longitudinal study with an initial cohort of 3721 individuals who represent working-age African Americans and whites initially between 30-64 years old recruited as a fixed cohort of participants by household screenings from an area probability sample of twelve neighborhoods (contiguous census tracts) in Baltimore City and one dress rehearsal neighborhood. Power analyses for longitudinal analyses after twenty years of follow-up with repeated assessments every three years specify at least 80% power for a minimum sample size of 30 participants per cell defined by race (African American, white), socioeconomic status (self-reported household income based on 125% of the 2004 Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines), age (seven 5-year age groups 30-64 years old), and sex. We identified neighborhoods that were likely to yield representative distributions of Baltimore City with sufficient individuals to fill the sampling design based on 2000 census data. The study domains examined in the baseline wave included: cognitive function, nutrition, neighborhood environment, anthropometry, cardiovascular health, physical performance, health services, molecular markers, genomics and psychology. The follow-up waves have added measures on personality, nephrology, neuroimaging, health literacy, and economic strain.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The Wave 3 re-visit examinations in the study began in July 2009. Evaluation of the success of the retention strategy is incomplete but data from the neighborhoods revisited thus far shows that the retention rate is 91% for those participants able to complete their follow-up examination. However, as HANDLS collects further information about our participants, it has become apparent there is a sub-population whose health status prevents them from completing the follow-up examination on NIA's Medical Research Vehicles. HANDLS is at risk for collecting biased follow-up data because this subpopulation is more likely to be lower socioeconomic status (OR = 3.15 95%CI = 1.70-5.82) and older (OR = 3.80 95%CI = 1.92-7.51). This suggests that NIA must examine this subgroup of participants to accurately assess the extent to which they have changed since the initial assessment. To avoid non-random missing data, the NIA developed the HANDLS Home Visit Program (HHVP). This protocol is designed to allow participants who are home bound or disabled to continue to participate in the HANDLS study as scheduled. Epidemiologists are unanimous in advising that collecting as complete data as possible is the most effective way to avoid biases introduced by non-random missing data. The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH-E9) guidelines state, "no universally applicable methods of handling missing values can be recommended" and they advise collected as much complete data as possible. Providing an alternative to the examination visit on the Medical Research Vehicles allows the NIA to collect valuable data about the influences of race and socioeconomic status on the development of age-related health disparities and disability among socioeconomically diverse African Americans and whites in Baltimore.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="BACKGROUND: white; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; BACKGROUND: white; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><br /></span></span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This procurement shall acquire the services of a contractor for a 5-year period to perform home-based medical evaluations for HANDLS participants who are unable to visit the NIA's Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs) for their follow-up medical evaluations. This HANDLS substudy is called the HANDLS Home Visit Program (HHVP). Initially, the NIA will require approximately 50 home visits per year conducted primarily in the Baltimore metropolitan area, but also in other areas to which participants may have moved. Home visit medical evaluations shall be performed according to the HANDLS timeline specified for participants' scheduled follow-up MRV visits. The first year will also include home visits that are out of sequence (behind the usual scheduled appointment date) because HANDLS was unable to evaluate the participant on the MRV when initially scheduled.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The main objectives of the procurement are: (1) to perform follow-up study evaluations on all HHVP participants identified by the Government; (2) create, implement, and manage a database tracking system for classifying all HHVP participants. The database will provide complete verification of the status of HANDLS home visit participants and shall include information indicating who are active and willing to participate, who completed a home visit, who have died, and who refuse the home visit (as they occur), and also up-to-date demographic and contact information for all home visit participants; (3) Increase the value of the study by reducing the biasing effect of "informative censoring" (non-random missing data); (4) Expand the collection of biological samples in participants who have developed substantial comorbidity and disability.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="BACKGROUND: white; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">BACKGROUND</span></span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"> </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><br />The National Institute on Aging (NIA) has a need for a project entitled, The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span Home Visit Program (HHVP). Health disparities are marked differences or inequalities in health measures, such as disability or mortality, between two or more population groups based on race or ethnicity, gender, education, socioeconomic status (SES), or other criteria. Health disparities among ethnic minorities, the poor, and the medically underserved are well documented nationally and internationally. From perspective of the National Institute on Aging (NIA), understanding health disparities is linked to understanding aging because health disparities are characteristically seen in commonly occurring age-associated diseases such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease as well as diabetes mellitus and cancer. The challenge to investigating health disparities and minority aging is designing and implementing studies that recruit and retain a racially and socioeconomically diverse cohort. Unfortunately, the failure to consistently include minority and socioeconomically diverse research participants has hampered efforts to address disparate health outcomes and conduct successful translational research in many areas of clinical research. With this background, the NIA developed the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study to investigate whether race and socioeconomic status influence health and age-related health disparities separately or synergistically as co-factors of behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">HANDLS is a prospective population-based interdisciplinary, longitudinal study with an initial cohort of 3721 individuals who represent working-age African Americans and whites initially between 30-64 years old recruited as a fixed cohort of participants by household screenings from an area probability sample of twelve neighborhoods (contiguous census tracts) in Baltimore City and one dress rehearsal neighborhood. Power analyses for longitudinal analyses after twenty years of follow-up with repeated assessments every three years specify at least 80% power for a minimum sample size of 30 participants per cell defined by race (African American, white), socioeconomic status (self-reported household income based on 125% of the 2004 Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines), age (seven 5-year age groups 30-64 years old), and sex. We identified neighborhoods that were likely to yield representative distributions of Baltimore City with sufficient individuals to fill the sampling design based on 2000 census data. The study domains examined in the baseline wave included: cognitive function, nutrition, neighborhood environment, anthropometry, cardiovascular health, physical performance, health services, molecular markers, genomics and psychology. The follow-up waves have added measures on personality, nephrology, neuroimaging, health literacy, and economic strain.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The Wave 3 re-visit examinations in the study began in July 2009. Evaluation of the success of the retention strategy is incomplete but data from the neighborhoods revisited thus far shows that the retention rate is 91% for those participants able to complete their follow-up examination. However, as HANDLS collects further information about our participants, it has become apparent there is a sub-population whose health status prevents them from completing the follow-up examination on NIA's Medical Research Vehicles. HANDLS is at risk for collecting biased follow-up data because this subpopulation is more likely to be lower socioeconomic status (OR = 3.15 95%CI = 1.70-5.82) and older (OR = 3.80 95%CI = 1.92-7.51). This suggests that NIA must examine this subgroup of participants to accurately assess the extent to which they have changed since the initial assessment. To avoid non-random missing data, the NIA developed the HANDLS Home Visit Program (HHVP). This protocol is designed to allow participants who are home bound or disabled to continue to participate in the HANDLS study as scheduled. Epidemiologists are unanimous in advising that collecting as complete data as possible is the most effective way to avoid biases introduced by non-random missing data. The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH-E9) guidelines state, "no universally applicable methods of handling missing values can be recommended" and they advise collected as much complete data as possible. Providing an alternative to the examination visit on the Medical Research Vehicles allows the NIA to collect valuable data about the influences of race and socioeconomic status on the development of age-related health disparities and disability among socioeconomically diverse African Americans and whites in Baltimore.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="BACKGROUND: white; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; BACKGROUND: white; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><br /></span></span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This procurement shall acquire the services of a contractor for a 5-year period to perform home-based medical evaluations for HANDLS participants who are unable to visit the NIA's Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs) for their follow-up medical evaluations. This HANDLS substudy is called the HANDLS Home Visit Program (HHVP). Initially, the NIA will require approximately 50 home visits per year conducted primarily in the Baltimore metropolitan area, but also in other areas to which participants may have moved. Home visit medical evaluations shall be performed according to the HANDLS timeline specified for participants' scheduled follow-up MRV visits. The first year will also include home visits that are out of sequence (behind the usual scheduled appointment date) because HANDLS was unable to evaluate the participant on the MRV when initially scheduled.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The main objectives of the procurement are: (1) to perform follow-up study evaluations on all HHVP participants identified by the Government; (2) create, implement, and manage a database tracking system for classifying all HHVP participants. The database will provide complete verification of the status of HANDLS home visit participants and shall include information indicating who are active and willing to participate, who completed a home visit, who have died, and who refuse the home visit (as they occur), and also up-to-date demographic and contact information for all home visit participants; (3) Increase the value of the study by reducing the biasing effect of "informative censoring" (non-random missing data); (4) Expand the collection of biological samples in participants who have developed substantial comorbidity and disability.</span></p>

<p>INTRODUCTION<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned  small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code 334516 should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project Background:<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.  <br />The NCATS Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) is tasked with identifying and developing novel small molecule leads against a wide spectrum of human disease targets, which it accomplishes by screening thousands of small molecules in collaboration with both intra-and extramural researchers.  In pursuit of this goal, the Center has a strong internal transdisciplinary team of scientists who continually discover novel small molecules for application against a wide range of human diseases.<br />The Trans-NIH RNAi initiative conducts high-throughput siRNA screens in collaboration with intramural investigators.  siRNAs down-regulate target genes possessing sequence complementarity.  In this way, we can interrogate a specific gene's function in the context of any biology we can assay. The initiative's work encompasses assay development, screening, and initial follow-up.  To conduct this work, the Facility has a fully automated robotic platform that greatly increases throughput and capacity.  This robot automates all tasks associated with the high-throughput screening of RNAi libraries, ranging from library stamping and reformatting to primary screens.  This request is for disposable tips that are specifically compatible with the robotic platform.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: <br />The purpose of this acquisition is to procure 384ST 30uL sterile, nested tips for use on Agilent BioCel fully automated robotic platform.</p>
<p><br />Period of Performance:  <br />30 days ARO</p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in March.
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.secure.force.com/AAAP. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>The Open Period for April is April 1, 2015 to April 7, 2015, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.secure.force.com/AAAP).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2014 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>If you have previously submitted an offer, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the new RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.   <br /> <br />OCCUPANCY: Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.<br /> <br />DELINEATED AREA:  Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and certain counties in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.<br /> <br />LEASE TERM:  Up to 10 years.</p>

<DESC><br />SECTION C<br />STATEMENT OF WORK/SPECIFICATIONS
<p><br />C.1 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The United States Mint needs a standard method of destroying test samples and coins that will not be released. All of this material is viable coinage and requires full accountability and security until it is destroyed.</p>
<p>C.2 SCOPE</p>
<p>This specification is for a standard Coin Crushing System (CCS) that is a turnkey, self-contained system for the destruction of coins and blanks. Environmentally friendly, low noise and highly reliable mechanical destruction techniques shall be used. The system shall accept coin and blanks from standard United States Mint containers, distort and mutilate the material to the extent all coin value is removed, and then discharge the resultant material into standard United States Mint containers. Installation, testing, training, documentation, and spare parts shall also be provided. The equipment may be purchased for any of the following Unites States Mint locations: West Point, Denver Mint, Philadelphia Mint, and San Francisco Mint.</p>
<p>C.3 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS</p>
<p>&bull; Lockout - Tag out (LOTO) Procedures</p>
<p>C.4 APPLICABLE STANDARDS</p>
<p>Where the equipment meets a foreign code or standard that equals or exceeds the corresponding U.S. code, the foreign equivalent is acceptable subject to prior approval by the Mint. <br />&bull; Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Regulations (Standards - 29 CFR), available at http://www.osha.gov/index.html<br />&bull; National Electric Code (NEC), 2002 edition, available from the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA), 1 Batterymarch Park, Quincy, MA 02269-9101, http://www.nfpa.org/Home/index.asp<br />&bull; National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA)<br />&bull; Joint Industrial Council (JIC)<br />&bull; National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), 1300 North 17th Street, Suite 1847, Rosslyn, Virginia 22209, http://www.nema.org</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C.5 REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>A self-contained CCS turnkey system for the destruction of coins and blanks shall be provided in accordance with the issued contract. The system shall accept coins from standard United States Mint coin tubs, mechanically deface and distort the coins, and discharge the resulting material into standard United States Mint scrap boxes. All components shall be integrated as necessary to provide a fully operational system that can be rapidly installed and put into operation without further United States Mint effort. Controls, hoppers, bins, conveyors and other material handling equipment, and noise reduction enclosures shall be provided as necessary.<br />Of paramount importance is that all material discharged into the output container has been rendered into scrap metal with no value as coinage. To this end, all components shall have sufficient durability and stability to operate for extended periods without repairs and adjustments. The degree of coin destruction, once set, shall be consistent and reliable over time.</p>
<p>C.6 INPUT MATERIAL</p>
<p>The system shall accept and destroy coins and blanks from the die testing center. The typical coin and blank specifications are summarized in the following table.<br />Denomination Diameter (mm) Thickness (mm) coins / kg Alloy<br />Cent Coin</p>
<p>19.05<br />18.80<br />18.75 1.55<br />1.25<br />1.46 400 Cu plated Zn<br />Nickel 21.20<br />21.26<br />20.96 1.95<br />1.57<br />1.80 200 Cu Ni<br />Dime 17.90<br />17.64<br />17.45 1.35<br />1.04<br />1.27 440 Cu Ni clad<br />Quarter 24.25<br />24.26<br />23.72 1.75<br />1.38<br />1.75 176 Cu Ni clad<br />Half 30.60<br />30.38<br />30.02 2.15<br />1.74<br />2.03 88 Cu Ni clad<br />Dollar 26.49<br />26.80<br />26.29 2.01<br />1.65<br />2.01 123 Cu Ni Mn<br />Dollar<br />38.10<br />37.82<br />37.49 2.77<br />2.34 37 silver</p>
<p>While most material will be separated by denomination, there will always some intermixing. The system shall accommodate intermixed material without loss of performance and without damage. Some coins and blanks will be deformed, not round, not flat, and with severe burrs and with separations of layers (delaminations). The feeding and separation portions of the system shall have the necessary capability to process this material without loss of performance.</p>
<p>C.7 MATERIAL HANDLING</p>
<p>The Contractor shall discuss the upgrades the United States Mint Facilities have made to their existing CCS machines before providing a final system price and configuration.</p>
<p>The United States Mint shall deliver coins and blanks to the system in a covered steel coin container. The system shall have provisions to quickly empty the container into a storage hopper. A contractor shall provide a safe and effective method of discharging the material from the container into the machine. The objective is to provide maximum personnel safety and effective utilization of the coin destruction equipment. It must be realized that a full coin tub weighs 1800 kg and could represent a major hazard to personnel and equipment during handling and unloading. Spillage of material shall be minimized.<br />Hoppers, conveyors, and feeders shall be provided as necessary to move the material through the system. It is anticipated that maintaining a consistent stream of material to the destruction device will be crucial for satisfactory long-term performance. To this end, the system shall provide the necessary volume and orientation required for smooth and consistent coin destruction. The system shall have adequate self-monitoring and self-protection to prevent machine damage or incomplete coin destruction as a result of feeding problems.<br />The system shall have adequate self-protection to prevent damage from ferrous objects such as tools, fasteners, etc., or damage from fused masses of coins. The system shall have provisions to separate these objects from the incoming stream of coins and blanks and collect them in a suitable open top container.</p>
<p>C.8 COIN DESTRUCTION</p>
<p>The equipment must destroy all material beyond recognition as it is discharged from the system that represents nothing with value as coinage. Of primary importance is:<br />&bull; High degree of security that will assure adequate destruction of all material, including mixed denominations.<br />&bull; High degree of safety for operating and maintenance personnel<br />&bull; Minimal operator intervention, freedom from plugging and jamming.<br />&bull; Low maintenance requirements, long tooling life<br />&bull; Low noise levels, low vibration and shock, and minimal dust</p>
<p><br />A start up, or testing mode shall be provided. This mode shall permit the operator run the system while performing maintenance and adjustments. All material shall be diverted to a suitable container as mentioned above.</p>
<p>C.9 SCRAP DELIVERY</p>
<p>Scrap shall be delivered into United States Mint provided containers. The United States Mint uses a variety of open top containers for transporting scrap back to the fabricator. The delivery area shall be configured to accept containers up to 48 inches wide (forklift access side), 42 inches front-to-back, and 39 inches high. Adequate clearance for forklift handling of scrap containers shall be provided. <br />The delivery area shall be separated from the rest of the system with a screened partition or other suitable barrier, for the purpose of preventing coins and blanks from reaching the scrap containers. The system shall therefore be designed such that frequent operator travel between the two areas is not required.</p>
<p>C.10 SAFETY</p>
<p>The equipment shall conform to the following requirements:<br />&bull; All applicable sections of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Regulations (Standards - 29 CFR), with particular attention to:<br />o Machine guarding.

<CONTACT>Sean G. Williams, Contracting Officer , Phone 202.664.3205, Email sean.williams@fema.dhs.gov
<DESC><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 15.201(c)(7) AND FAR 52.215-3. This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP). An RFP is not being issued at this time, and this notice shall not be considered as a commitment by the Government to issue a RFP, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. <br />BACKGROUND<br /><br />The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is a Federal agency authorized under 44CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) and PL (Public Law) 93-288 as amended by PL 100-707 to provide assistance to disaster victims in Presidential declared disasters and emergencies. As a part of these disaster relief efforts, FEMA conducts residential housing inspections for disaster survivors. These inspections are completed using a line item method where required repairs are recorded as a construction component (with required quantity and associated unit cost). The inspection is recorded using a damage estimating software solution. FEMA's Individuals and Households Program (IHP), as well as other agencies involved in disaster relief are the end users of this data.<br />OPERATIONAL CONCEPT<br /><br />FEMA seeks a partnership with a Contractor to develop a database on a Microsoft Access platform that provides the unit cost for FEMA home repair components. The Contractor shall perform research of repair line item costs in each Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code areas across the country to provide a database that represents the local economy in a disaster location. Services specified under this contract require quarterly updates and additional pricing work that reflect changes in prices due to current economic conditions in each FIPS code location. <br />ACQUISITION CONCEPT<br /><br />FEMA anticipates issuing a solicitation for a housing repair line item database in the near future. In order to facilitate this solicitation the Agency is seeking information from the construction cost estimating software community.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Agency anticipations that the future solicitation will have the following general requirements: <br />1. Scope<br /><br />a. Develop and update the FEMA Line Item Database in a Microsoft Access format with an interactive front end application capable of entering a disaster number, selecting a state or territory, selecting counties, municipalities or parishes within the state or territory, and exporting the pricing data in FEMA's designated tab delimited format described in Attachment B.<br /><br />b. The line item format includes a category, line item number, line item name, unit of measure and a description of repair represented by the line item. The line item cost is a sum of all cost components associated in the use of that line item<br /><br />c. The database shall be updated quarterly, delivered to FEMA through a FTP (File Transfer Protocol) site to be imported by FEMA. The first deliverable of the base year if exercised, shall be delivered in the first weeks of:<br />i. September = Q1<br />ii. December = Q2<br />iii. March = Q3<br />iv. June = Q4
<p>d. Develop an annual Line Item Mapping Master - A Microsoft Excel file of the Line Item basis and rationale used for pricing that provides a breakdown of the line item components as CSI codes with national average costs.<br /><br />e. Develop a Line Item Basis Document - A definition of the individual and cumulative cost elements that make up the line item price.</p>
<p>2. Tasks <br /><br />a. Line Items Database - The interactive database shall consist of 381 line items, descriptions and exclusions inclusive of services, real and personal property items, speed estimating, room composition descriptions and boat repair components. Unless noted, the Contractor shall provide pricing that reflect the usage descriptions provided. (Attachment A)<br /><br />b. The Contractor shall develop a database capable of exporting the pricing data in the FEMA designated tab delimited format. (Attachment B) and Section 7. Mandatory Technical Requirements.<br /><br />c. The Contractor shall provide the database and the quarterly updates in the most current version of Microsoft Access format. <br /><br />d. The database and quarterly updates shall indicate the dollar amount of each line item and represent pricing within the FEMA designated FIPS locations. All FEMA line items are intended to provide repairs that meet International Residential Building Codes.<br /><br />e. Personal Property line items under the Appliance/PP category, unless noted, will have a single national average pricing basis for all FEMA designated FIPS code locations.<br /><br />f. Line Item Mapping Master - The Contractor shall provide a soft copy MS Excel document showing the basis for all line items; e.g. formulas used for pricing, labor and material quantities, removal and disposal etc. as well as overhead, profit calculations and other related cost factors.<br /><br />g. Basis Definition Document - The Contractor shall provide a line item basis document in MS Excel or alternative application format that defines, in easily understandable terms, the CSI codes and formulas used to derive the components costs associated with the application of that line item. If the Contractor would like to provide the document in an alternative format, they must obtain prior approval from the CO and COR.<br /><br />h. Contract Modifications - Due to continual changes in the scope of the FEMA program and provision of prompt disaster assistance, the Government may request developmental work or additional line items and basis adjustments over the life of the contract.<br /><br />i. The Government may request future modifications to allow the FEMA operating systems to work in an alternative operating platform. A separate Statement of Objectives or Statement of Work will be submitted by the Contract Officer to the Contractor for a technical and price proposal.

<DESC>Veterans Affairs Network Contracting Office 6 (NCO 6) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Hill-Rom, Inc. (DUNS:  004245668), pursuant to FAR 8.405-6.  The proposed sole source purchase order is for fifteen (15) Hill-Rom Progressa PRO-885 intensive care unit beds with Chair Egress Frame Design.  The approved action is a sole source award to Hill-Rom, Inc. on FSS Schedule 65 II A, SIN A-69.  Delivery will be made to the Richmond VA Medical Center.

The facility currently has 15 Hill-Rom Progressa PRO-885 hospital beds in the intensive care unit.  The original procurement was competitively awarded to replace part of the existing inventory, due to the age of the existing equipment.  The facility requires 15 additional units of the same make and model of ICU bed.  The same make and model must be purchased for the purpose of continuity of care.  Bed functions differ significantly enough between brands to cause a disruption to operations by having equipment from different manufacturers.  FSS Schedule 65 II A is a mandatory source and Hill-Rom is the only available source on FSS Schedule 65 II A for the Progressa PRO-885 ICU Bed.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any responsible source who believes it is capable of meeting the requirement may submit a capability statement to the contracting office no later than Tuesday, April 5, 2016, 5:00PM, EST. Interest/capability statements may be sent to Daniel Spaulding (contractor) at daniel.spaulding@va.gov.  No telephone responses will be accepted.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Veterans Affairs Network Contracting Office 6 (NCO 6) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with PRO-AIM Americas, LLC (DUNS:  962568338), pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.5, specifically FAR 13.501(a)(1), and Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.  The proposed sole source purchase order is for five (5) ERBE VIO 300D Electrosurgical Units, five (5) APC2 coagulators and related parts.  Delivery will be made to the Salisbury VAMC for distribution to the Charlotte and Kernersville Health Care Centers.

The action will result in the purchase of five (5) ERBE VIO 3000D electrosurgical units, five (5) APC2 argon plasma coagulators and related parts, for delivery to the Charlotte and Kernersville Health Care Centers in Charlotte and Kernersville, North Carolina.  A new firm-fixed price purchase order will be awarded.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items and specifically FAR 13.501 Special Documentation Requirements, where acquisitions conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2.

The sole source procurement is being conducted on the basis of (1) standardization with existing equipment used at the Salisbury VA Medical Center and satellite medical facilities.  The equipment is familiar to medical staff and changing brands would unnecessarily increase the risk of patient injury, as medical personnel rotate between facilities.  (2) Use of another brand is prohibitive due to concerns related to training.  The medical staff is trained on the ERBE brand of electrosurgical/APC equipment and must have their competency affirmed on a periodic basis.  Using another brand of equipment will cause the facility to revise its training program and to re-establish competency for all users on multiple devices, in different locations.  No competing device is so advantageous as to warrant changing brands and causing the facility to conduct multiple, repetitive training actions to support one device.  Standardization for the purpose of ensuring patient safety, with regard to this ESU/APC equipment, was supported under GAO ruling B-411904.  Standardization is further supported in the attached peer-reviewed journal article, "Evaluating and Predicting Patient Safety for Medical Devices with Integral Information Technology."

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any responsible source who believes it is capable of meeting the requirement may submit a capability statement to the contracting office no later than Tuesday, April 5, 2016, 6:00PM EST.  Interest/capability statements may be sent to Daniel Spaulding (contractor) at daniel.spaulding@va.gov.  No telephone responses will be accepted.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>JSOC JCTE, Email osd.jcte@mail.mil
<DESC><strong>Title: 2016 JSOC Events and Technology Needs Lists</strong>
<p><strong>Description(s):</strong><br />The Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) has assembled 2 versions of SOF Technology and Capability Needs, a SECRET listing of approximately 100, and a subset of approximately 40 needs at the UNCLASSIFIED level.  The lists will be available for release to Industry, Academia, and National Labs in April 2016.  JSOC will follow up the release of the Needs Lists with two events:</p>
<p>1.	Appropriate personnel will be available this year at SOFIC 2016, 23-26 May 2016 in Tampa, FL to discuss JSOC UNCLASSIFIED gaps during the four Program Executive Office - SOF Warrior (PEO-SW) briefing tracks.  Exact times/locations for PEO-SW conference session are TBD, but will be available at: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.sofic.org/Pages/Default.aspx</span>.</p>
<p>2.	JSOC will host a Capabilities Solutions Event in concert with PEO-SOF Warrior's annual Special Operations Forces Warrior Industry Collaboration (SOFWIC) event to be held TBD in October 2016 timeframe.</p>
<p><strong>SYNOPSIS: 2016 JSOC Events and Technology Needs List</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. INTRODUCTION:</strong><br />This notice is NOT a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p>The JSOC mission is to conduct studies; training; exercises; research, development, testing, and evaluation; and acquisition and procurement to ensure interoperability among special operations forces (SOF), general purpose forces, and interagency and foreign partners. JSOC has assigned and attached subordinate units and may deploy to support Geographic Combatant Commander's training, exercises, activities, and operations.</p>
<p>It is JSOC's desire to inform and influence industry's internal investment decisions in areas that address SOF's most sensitive and urgent needs.  Many in industry have expertise, capacity, funding, and a desire to better understand and invest in SOF unique needs.</p>
<p>Factors that make this unique collaboration opportunity attractive include: 1) <strong>Increasing Military Budget Austerity</strong> - SOF is a judicious transition partner whose future resourcing is among the most well-preserved of the military Services. It is JSOC's desire to improve collaboration in an era where budget austerity tends to erect barriers to open communication. 2) <strong>Intellectual Property (IP)</strong> - The commercialization of dual-use (government/ commercial) technology can reduce costs to the government, but government contracting IP clauses can restrict industry's ability to capitalize on their own IP.  Our proposed collaboration model preserves and protects industry's ownership of their intellectual property.</p>
<p><strong>B. OBJECTIVE:</strong><br />The purpose of this Special Notice is threefold: one, to provide Industry the ability to request the 2016 JSOC Capability Needs list in order to help focus industry research and development decisions toward JSOC's unique needs; two, to provide an overview of the planned events for 2016; and three, to briefly discuss various ways of industry engagement with SOCOM and JSOC.</p>
<p>JSOC's Technology Needs listing includes multiple needs in each of the following functional areas:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.	Breaching<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.	Communications<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.	Electronic Warfare<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.	Fire Support<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.	Information Technology<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.	Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.	Knowledge Management<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.	Lighten the Load<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.	Mobility<br />&nbsp; 10.	Scalable Effects Engagement/Non-Lethal<br />&nbsp; 11.	Power and Energy<br />&nbsp; 12.	Soldier Survival<br />&nbsp; 13.	Target Engagement<br />&nbsp; 14.	Visual Augmentation<br />&nbsp; 15.	Other Need Areas</p>
<p>JSOC plans to provide Industry representatives with several engagement options including, but not limited to, submitting responses to the SOCOM Broad Area Announcement (BAA), participating in SOF AT&amp;L hosted Capability Collabortion Events (CCEs) at SOFWERX, submitting applications to participate in SOCOM Technical Experimentation (TE) events, Vendor Loan Agreements (VLA), and entering into a Collaborative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with SOCOM/JSOC.</p>
<p>JSOC does NOT anticipate issuing Requests for Proposals and/or awarding contracts as a result of this Special Notice.</p>
<p><strong>C. REGISTRATION:</strong><br />Requests for the 2016 JSOC Needs Lists can be email to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">osd.jcte@mail.mil</span>, and should include:<br />&nbsp; 1.	Requestor Name<br />&nbsp; 2.	Company Name</p>
<p>Requests for the classified list should also include:<br />&nbsp; 3.	CAGE Code <br />&nbsp; 4.	Classified Mailing Address: both Inner and Outer labels including the Attn: line POC <br />&nbsp; 5.	Delivery Method: Pick Up (specify CD or Paper Hard Copy); via email on SIPR, JWICS, CWAN/GWAN; or via registered US mail (specify CD or Paper Hard Copy)</p>
<p>NOTE: All requestors within a 75 mile radius of the Pentagon in Washington, DC who cannot receive the list via email will be required to pick up the list.  In addition, those who received the 2015 Needs List will be able to request a compilation of 2016 changes document.  Those who haven't received the 2015 Needs List can request a full copy.</p>
<p><strong>F. SPECIAL NOTICE:</strong><br />JSOC will utilize contractor consultant/advisors to assist with the distribution of the 2016 Capabilities and Technology Needs List.  All advisors shall comply with procurement integrity laws and shall sign non-disclosure agreements.  The Government shall take into consideration requirements for avoiding conflicts of interest and ensure advisors comply with safeguarding proprietary data.  Contractor consultant/advisors will also be involved in follow on collaboration with selected Industry partners, including managing and maintaining websites/databases and other tasks JSOC assigns.</p>

<CONTACT>Steven Hau, Email skhau@sandia.gov
<DESC>Technology Commercialization Opportunity: High Speed, High Current Pulsed LED Driver
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background Information:</span></strong></p>
<p>Sandia's LED Pulser drives high-power LEDs to generate light pulses with shorter duration, higher repetition frequency, and higher intensity than is possible with commercially available LED drivers. This technology utilizes specially designed electronic circuitry that allows it to create intense pulses as short as ten nanoseconds that can illuminate extremely fast processes, such as fuel injection. The LED Pulser can emit up to four colors, each with independent timing and from a nearly coincident source area. This enables a wider range of optical applications and could lead to new imaging techniques. Sandia has applied for a US Patent on this technology.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technology Highlights:</span></strong></p>
<p>-	Smaller and less expensive<br />-	Capable of MHz repetition rates<br />-	High resolution images of high speed processes<br />-	Operates with significantly lower energy consumption<br />-	Light-pulse duration approximately 3 orders of magnitude less (~10ns vs. ~10ms)<br />-	No warm up necessary</p>
<p><strong><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Potential Applications:</span></strong></p>
<p>-	High-speed machine vision<br />-	Semiconductor manufacturing<br />-	High-speed photography<br />-	High-speed scanning<br />-	Microscopy</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opportunity Description:</span></strong></p>
<p>SNL is seeking partners to further develop and commercialize the high speed, high current pulsed driver circuit through Licensing Agreements.</p>
<p>Sandia invites interested parties to provide a detailed description of relevant background, experience, expertise, and capabilities that could help commercialize the technology. Specific requirements are as follows:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mandatory Requirements:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br />1)	U.S. companies that are able to enter into a licensing agreement with Sandia National Laboratories and have manufacturing capabilities<br />2)	Demonstrated experience, expertise, and capabilities in the design, development and manufacturing of electronic driver circuitry<br />3)	Demonstrated experience in bringing products to market</p>
<p><br />In addition to evaluating the provided information as outlined above, Sandia will evaluate all responses and select prospective parties with which to engage in further discussions based on the following criteria, pursuant to Sandia's technology transfer mission:</p>
<p><br />1)	How will the respondent deploy the technology for the benefit of the U.S. public good?<br />2)	How would the respondent's deployment of the technology benefit U.S. economic competitiveness?</p>
<p>Sandia is a multi-program laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the United States Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.</p>

<p>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Portland District (Corps), will be presenting the current forecasted rehabilitation plan for the MCR North and South Jetties. <br />In June 2012, USACE Northwestern Division approved the Major Rehabilitation Evaluation Report. Approval of this report authorized the Corps to begin designing the rehabilitation of the MCR Jetty system including Jetty A, North Jetty and South Jetty. In Fiscal Year (FY15) the Corps received funding to award the construction contract for Jetty A. The Corps currently anticipates releasing requests for proposals for the North Jetty rehabilitation project in 2017 and South Jetty rehabilitation project in 2019. The current planning estimate for stone quantities is 220,000 tons of new jetty stone procurement and placement for North Jetty and 344,000 ton of new jetty stone procurement and placement for the South Jetty.<br />For more in-depth information regarding the Corps' authority and plans to rehabilitate the MCR jetty system, please refer to the MCR Jetties Major Rehabilitation Report which can be found on the Corps website: http://www.nwp.usace.army.mil/Missions/Current/ColumbiaRiverjetties.aspx<br />The Corps seeks to inform and discuss with interested construction contractors and quarries, the following:</p>
<p>&bull;General Scope of Work</p>
<p>o Discussion on site access, stone/equipment staging, barge offloading facilities, Contractor requirements, jetty stone placement requirements and phasing, seasonal work windows.</p>
<p>&bull;Anticipated Stone Quality and Testing Requirements</p>
<p>o Present a range of size and quality of stone and subsequent testing requirements.</p>
<p>o Discussion on regional quarry availability: Discussion with the Quarry and Prime Contractors to ascertain what they see as the biggest challenge with being prepared and competitive for large jetty projects.</p>
<p>&bull;Current Optimized Rehabilitation Schedule</p>
<p>&bull;Anticipated Period of Performance</p>
<p>&bull;Anticipated Job Advertisement Periods</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ERDC Contracting Office intends to make award to MMC Materials Inc. on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). Over the past twenty years the local concrete plant owned by Master Mixed Concrete (MMC) Materials, Inc. in Vicksburg, MS has played an integral role in the design process of the specialized CSPC, GUHPC, and 10-12 KSI concrete mixtures. Because the company is local, a quality control technician from the ERDC Concrete and Materials Branch has been on-site to ensure that design parameters are met. All three of these mixtures are very specific, which makes it of critical importance to use the same vendor to duplicate exactly the material and manufacturing process required to produce the concrete targets. Variations in suppliers would require timely and costly material testing and comparison that would introduce variations and inconsistencies with years of experimental results. The NAICS code for this requirement is 327310 (Cement Manufacturing) with a size standard of 750 employees.
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals. A solicitation will not be issued. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The information submitted must be provided in sufficient detail to demonstrate the vendor's ability to fulfill this requirement. The contractor must also provide a description of their past experience in fulfilling requirements which are the same or similar to this requirement and references for each.</p>
<p>Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Responses to this requirement may be submitted to Jody Criss at Jody.Criss@usace.army.mil. The solicitation number shall be included in the subject line of the e-mail submission. Responses must be received no later than 3 days from the posted date of this notice.</p>

<p>GENERAL PROPOSAL INFORMATION<br />Offerors are hereby notified that initial proposals which are found incomplete may be rejected without affording the offeror an opportunity to satisfy the requirement of the Government. Notwithstanding the information included in support of the offeror's technical capability, the contractor must meet all requirements of this request for proposal.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items.</p>
<p>The Government will award a Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers: Best Value based on Performance Price Trade-off (PPT).</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD:<br />This is a competitive selection in which all evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price.<br />The Government expects to award one firm-fixed price requirements contract with one (1) basic period and four (4) 1-year option periods as a result of this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions or make no award should no vendor prove to be an acceptable offeror based on the criteria set forth in the solicitation. The US Government will make an award to the responsible (IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulation [FAR]) contractor whose offer conforms to the solicitation and are determined to be the most advantageous to the Government considering price and non-price factors. <br />The Government will evaluate Part II, Technical Specifications on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. After all offerors have been ranked by price, the technical proposals will be evaluated for acceptability. If an offeror received an overall acceptable rating on the Technical, the Government will then evaluate the offeror's past performance. Offerors receiving an unacceptable rating for the Technical will not receive further consideration. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and other information required by 52.212-1 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate Part III, Past Performance on a level of confidence basis shown below.</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall seek recent and relevant performance information on all offerors based on (1) the past efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.<br />Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving (Aircraft Corrosion Services) that involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation requirements based on the offeror's demonstrated past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no recent/relevant performance history or if the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably (neutral).</p>
<p>In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this Request for Proposal (RFP.)</p>
<p>If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced offer is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment, then the evaluation continues until an acceptable offeror is judged to have "Substantial Confidence".</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information instructed above. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports an unacceptable rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision. At this point the Government will perform an integrated assessment to determine best value.</p>
<p>The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>
<p><br />2. REJECTION OF UNREALISTIC OFFERS: <br />Any proposal which is unrealistic will be judged either as exhibiting a lack of competence or failure to comprehend the Government's requirements and may be so evaluated and rated, or rejected for such reasons. Furthermore, any significant inconsistency between the Technical Proposal and Price Proposal, if unexplained, may be grounds for rejection of the proposal. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly IAW its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the Offeror's proposal. Nothing in this paragraph is to be construed as a promise by the Government to conduct a price realism analysis where it would otherwise not be required to do so. The decision to conduct or not to conduct such an analysis remains in the sound discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The solicitation and subsequent award for this acquisition contains the clause at FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. This option to extend the contract term is evaluated as part of the initial evaluation, so that any resultant exercise of this option is within scope of the pending contract. The inclusion of this clause provides up to six (6) months of continued performance when it is in the Government's best interest to continue performance after the end of the final contract performance period. If conditions warrant the exercise of this option, the price(s) for the continued performance under this clause shall be at the same price(s) as the prior performance period.</p>
<p>PRICE: The Government will evaluate offers based on prices proposed for all CLINs and any other price<br />related factors required by the solicitation. The offeror's quote will be evaluated for Reasonableness and Total Evaluated Price.</p>
<p>1. Reasonableness: The existence of adequate price competition is expected to support a determination of <br />reasonableness. If adequate price competition is not obtained or if price reasonableness cannot be determined using price analysis, other techniques will be used.</p>
<p>2. Total Evaluated Price (TEP): The Government will utilize the following methodology to determine the TEP of each proposal. The TEP will be calculated for evaluation purposes only. The TEP will be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>i. CLINs will be calculated by multiplying the proposed unit price by the corresponding quantity.<br />ii. The sum of all the CLINs evaluated prices will represent the total evaluated price <br />iii. Award will be made to the responsible offeror that represents the best value to the US Government.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITY: The following technical capability will be evaluated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. If paragraph I through IV are not submitted with the proposal, the proposal shall be considered unacceptable and shall be removed from consideration.</p>
<p>The contractor at a minimum shall present the understanding and show how to accomplish the items listed in section 1 of the PWS:</p>
<p>I. Aircraft Wash Services Management Functions The contractor shall provide a company capability statement showing how to meet the program IAW 1.1.3 of the PWS and show how to execute an effective foreign object damage control and prevention program IAW 1.1.4 of the PWS.

<p>IV. Environmental Compliance The contractor shall provide a company capability statement demonstrating knowledge of how to safely manage hazardous materials and which provides a history of environmental compliance IAW 1.4 and 1.5 of the PWS.</p>
<p>The following ratings will be used in rating technical capability:</p>
<p>Acceptable: Proposed clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation<br />Unacceptable: Proposed does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE: Recent and relevant past performance is defined as past performance having occurred in the last 3 years preceding the date of the solicitation issuance. Relevant past performance is defined as past performance providing candidates for services similar in scope to this requirement and complexity. The Government will consider relevancy, recency, extent of the past performance and the size and complexity of the past performance relative to this solicitation's requirement submitted by offerors as well as any information gathered by the Contracting Officer. Offerors that have no relevant past performance history will be assigned an unknown past performance evaluation rating; unknown will be rated as acceptable.</p>
<p>The government will use the following relevancy ratings when assessing recent and relevant contracts:<br />Relevant Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires<br />Not Relevant Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br /><br />The following ratings will be used in rating past performance:<br />Rating Description<br />Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort<br />Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />Limited Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />No Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />Unknown Confidence (Neutral) No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

 852.203-70 COMMERCIAL ADVERTISING
The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor.

(End of Clause)

852.211-70 SERVICE DATA MANUALS
(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.

(b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.

(c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions.

(d) Section II, Installation. Section II shall provide pertinent installation information. It shall list all input and output connectors using applicable reference designators and functional names as they appear on the equipment. Included in this listing will be a brief description of the function of each connector along with the connector type. Instructions shall be provided as to the recommended method of repacking the equipment for shipment (packing material, labeling, etc.).

(e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.

(f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section.

(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.

(h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.

(i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches.

Following receipt of offers, the Contracting Officer or Specialist will send a form, designed to elicit financial information from an offeror's financial institution, to those offerors having a reasonable chance at receiving the award under this solicitation. You should forward that form to your financial institution and have the financial institution complete and send it directly to (Does the address of the MICC show up on the solicitation? If so, can refer to that address). For sections 2 and 4 on the document, the financial institution may answer with high, medium or low or they can answer with a numerical amount. The form must be returned to the MICC within three (3) business days. In the absence of this information, the Contracting Officer will have no choice except to find your company "not responsible," a finding which will make you ineligible for award." <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

Appendix C
VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE FOR INCLUSION INTO CONTRACTS, AS APPROPRIATE
1. GENERAL
Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be
subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.
2. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS
a. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA
information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.
b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with
VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid
security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.
d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S.
to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.
e. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when
an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.
f. Contractor will comply with VA Handbook 6500.6 that states they will ensure VA sensitive information will be protected

VA HANDBOOK 6500.6 MARCH 12, 2010
APPENDIX C
C-2
3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE
a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written
agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data
- General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).
b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the
contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.
c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not
destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.
d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use,
disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.
e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as
authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic
information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.

C-3
f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality,
privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.

VA HANDBOOK 6500.6 MARCH 12, 2010
APPENDIX C
C-4
g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated
and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business
Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.
h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.
i. The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.

performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.
k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA
records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human
immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.
l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA
sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR.

5. INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE
a. All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor/subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the contractors/subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract.

b. Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives,
optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are:
 	(1) Vendor must accept the system without the drive;
(2) VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or
(3) VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.
 (4) Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software
associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;
b. The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has
sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned
physically intact; and
c. Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be preapproved and described in the purchase order or contract.
d. A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the
drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.

4.  SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION
a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in
unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access. 
b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's
notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.
c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is
deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.
d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor
must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive
relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.

5. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH
a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to
sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.
b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set
forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.
c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach,
including the following:
(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
(2) Description of the event, including:
(a) date of occurrence;
(b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number,
date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
(3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised
(made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
(8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and
Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.
d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be
responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $______ per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
(1) Notification;
(2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
(3) Data breach analysis;
(4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and
credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
(5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
(6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit
records, histories, or financial affairs.

6. SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING
On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to
evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $4.27 per hour or $170.80 per week or $740.13 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, 4 weeks after 15 years, and 5 weeks after 20 years.<br />Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present<br />contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in<br />the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>g. Chamber must be constructed of either metal (stainless steel) or glass (including quartz), and must be able to safely operate at an ultimate base pressure of 1x10-5 Torr or lower. In the case of glass, system must come with a metallic cage to serve as an implosion shield for safety purposes. Chambers must come with appropriate o-rings and/or sealing hardware, if required for operation.<br />h. System must include a high vacuum pump (presumably a turbomolecular drag pump), that is able to reach the aforementioned ultimate base pressure, and either (1) a mechanical rough backing pump or, (2) means of connecting a pre-existing mechanical rough backing pump to the exhaust of the high vacuum pump.</p>
<p>i. Sputtering head must be capable of DC sputtering (DC &amp; RF acceptable), with currents of at least 35 milliamps DC, at whatever DC voltage is required to consistently maintain plasma discharge.</p>
<p>j. System must be capable of operating with at least argon (Ar) gas, but may also operate with additional gases such as oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2), etc.</p>
<p>k. System must either include (1) a means of measuring film deposition measurement in real time via Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) that measures both thickness and deposition rate, in metric units (kilo-angstroms k&Aring;, and angstroms/sec &Aring;/s, respectively) or, (2) have an available port on the vacuum chamber to accommodate a pre-existing film deposition QCM.</p>
<p>l. System input power of 110/120 VAC, single phase, requiring no more than 15 amps.</p>
<p>m. System must conform to any and all safety requirements involving, high voltage, pressurized gases, vacuum, magnetic fields, etc.</p>

Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>

Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.<br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />8. 25.101 BUY AMERICA ACT</p>
<p>(a) The Buy American Act restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products. For manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product.</p>
<p>(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and</p>
<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>
<p>52.249-1 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT</p>

The provision at FAR 52.212-2, EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS, applies to this acquisition. 
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
The final contract award decision shall be based on the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA), whereas the Government will not recognize any value from a proposal exceeding the Government's minimum technical or past performance experience requirements. The evaluation factors shall be 1) Technical Capability; 2) Price; and 3) Past Performance Experience.  Offeror who proposes to perform work for an unrealistically low price will not be considered.
Technical and past performance, when combined, is more significant than price. 
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p>2.	ISSUANCE DATE: April 1, 2016</p>
<p>3.	CLOSING DATE/TIME FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: April 15, 5:00 pm Eastern Time</p>
<p>4.	POSITION TITLE: Program Operations Advisor</p>
<p>5.	MARKET VALUE: This position has been designated as a "tandem" position that, depending on the qualifications of the candidate, can be filled at either the GS-11 ($64,650 - $84,044 per annum) or GS-12 ($77,490 - $100,736 per annum) equivalent level, DC-locality pay. Final compensation will be negotiated within the listed market value of the GS-11 or GS-12 level depending on qualifications, previous relevant experience and work history, salary and educational background. Salaries over and above the pay range will not be entertained or negotiated. Candidates who live outside the Washington, D.C. area will be considered for employment but no relocation expenses will be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Note: Applicants who submit an application for the GS-12 grade level, but do not meet the minimum qualifications as outlined in this solicitation and as reviewed by the Technical Evaluation Committee, will not be considered for the GS-11 positions if they have not submitted a separate application for the GS-11 level. Similarly, applicants who apply for the GS-11 position even though they might meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-12 position will not be considered for the higher graded position if they have not submitted a separate application for the GS-12 position. Applicants who are unsure of which grade level they meet the minimum qualifications for should submit separate applications for the GS-11 and the GS-12 positions. The application will be considered for the lowest grade level if the applicant does not specify the grade level in the submission.</p>
<p>6.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year, with four one-year option periods.</p>
<p>The Personal Services Contractor hired under this contract will provide up to a maximum of 250 workdays of services on an annual basis. The specific projects, as well as dates, number of days and locations to be worked, will be determined by mutual agreement between the contract employee and his/her OTI supervisor according to the programmatic needs of OTI. There is no obligation by OTI to provide assignments for a minimum number of days, and the contractor is free to provide "blackout" dates during which he or she will not be available to accept assignments.</p>
<p>This recruitment is for an intermittent USPSC. Therefore, if a candidate is selected at the GS-11 grade, they do not have the opportunity for advancement to the GS-12 grade. However, once the candidate reaches the minimum qualifications of the GS-12 grade, he/she may apply for a GS-12 position if re-solicited by DCHA/OTI in the future. Extension of the contract is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>START DATE:  Within 45 days of receiving notification that required security clearance has been obtained.</p>

<p>9.	STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. Some of these USPSCs serve on intermittent contracts and are referred to in OTI as "bullpenners," providing support in a surge capacity. Those serving in the bullpen must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations). USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Program Operations Advisor is a key administrative position in a busy office that responds rapidly to crisis situations. It is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support. To achieve this, OTI relies on Program Operations Advisors who have the capacity to work well within a team environment, provide a variety of necessary ad hoc or longer term administrative support to different teams (e.g. administrative services, human resources, training, travel, finance, information and technology, outreach, country program teams, field operations, etc), and anticipate the needs of a complex organizational unit. A common characteristic among OTI staff is that they are operationally-minded, enjoy working in a fast-paced environment, and seek innovative ways to improve efficiency and effectiveness of operations support and programs.</p>
<p>The Program Operations Advisor is experienced in the multitude of functions that comprise operations support for OTI programs, and provides services that require professionalism, knowledge, diplomacy and operational expertise in administrative support. This individual must be readily available to provide the required services on an intermittent basis, often on short notice with little time for preparation. While the vast majority of the work will be performed in Washington, there may be requirements for field travel. OTI field offices are located in countries with complex problems, often in difficult and harsh environments, with some offices located in countries with no other USAID presence.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items.</p>

The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers: Best Value based on Performance Price Trade-off (PPT).</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD:<br />This is a competitive selection in which all evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price.<br />The Government expects to award one firm-fixed price requirements contract with one (1) basic period and four (4) 1-year option periods as a result of this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions or make no award should no vendor prove to be an acceptable offeror based on the criteria set forth in the solicitation. The US Government will make an award to the responsible (IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulation [FAR]) contractor whose offer conforms to the solicitation and are determined to be the most advantageous to the Government considering price and non-price factors. <br />The Government will evaluate Part II, Technical Specifications on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. After all offerors have been ranked by price, the technical proposals will be evaluated for acceptability. If an offeror received an overall acceptable rating on the Technical, the Government will then evaluate the offeror's past performance.

The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and other information required by 52.212-1 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate Part III, Past Performance on a level of confidence basis shown below.</p>

The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation requirements based on the offeror's demonstrated past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no recent/relevant performance history or if the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably (neutral).</p>
<p>In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this Request for Proposal (RFP.)</p>
<p>If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced offer is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment, then the evaluation continues until an acceptable offeror is judged to have "Substantial Confidence".</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information instructed above. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports an unacceptable rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision. At this point the Government will perform an integrated assessment to determine best value.</p>
<p>The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>
<p><br />2. REJECTION OF UNREALISTIC OFFERS: <br />Any proposal which is unrealistic will be judged either as exhibiting a lack of competence or failure to comprehend the Government's requirements and may be so evaluated and rated, or rejected for such reasons. Furthermore, any significant inconsistency between the Technical Proposal and Price Proposal, if unexplained, may be grounds for rejection of the proposal. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly IAW its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the Offeror's proposal. Nothing in this paragraph is to be construed as a promise by the Government to conduct a price realism analysis where it would otherwise not be required to do so. The decision to conduct or not to conduct such an analysis remains in the sound discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The solicitation and subsequent award for this acquisition contains the clause at FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. This option to extend the contract term is evaluated as part of the initial evaluation, so that any resultant exercise of this option is within scope of the pending contract. The inclusion of this clause provides up to six (6) months of continued performance when it is in the Government's best interest to continue performance after the end of the final contract performance period. If conditions warrant the exercise of this option, the price(s) for the continued performance under this clause shall be at the same price(s) as the prior performance period.</p>
<p>PRICE: The Government will evaluate offers based on prices proposed for all CLINs and any other price<br />related factors required by the solicitation. The offeror's quote will be evaluated for Reasonableness and Total Evaluated Price.</p>
<p>1. Reasonableness: The existence of adequate price competition is expected to support a determination of <br />reasonableness. If adequate price competition is not obtained or if price reasonableness cannot be determined using price analysis, other techniques will be used.</p>
<p>2. Total Evaluated Price (TEP): The Government will utilize the following methodology to determine the TEP of each proposal. The TEP will be calculated for evaluation purposes only. The TEP will be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>i. CLINs will be calculated by multiplying the proposed unit price by the corresponding quantity.<br />ii. The sum of all the CLINs evaluated prices will represent the total evaluated price <br />iii. Award will be made to the responsible offeror that represents the best value to the US Government.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITY: The following technical capability will be evaluated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. If paragraph I through IV are not submitted with the proposal, the proposal shall be considered unacceptable and shall be removed from consideration.</p>
<p>The contractor at a minimum shall present the understanding and show how to accomplish the items listed in section 1 of the PWS:</p>
<p>I. Aircraft Wash Services Management Functions The contractor shall provide a company capability statement showing how to meet the program IAW 1.1.3 of the PWS and show how to execute an effective foreign object damage control and prevention program IAW 1.1.4 of the PWS.

Aircraft Tow, Wash, De-paneling Lubrication and De-paneling Services The contractor shall provide a company capability statement showing how they plan to meet Aircraft Tow, Wash, Lubrication, De-paneling and Cleaning Services requirements IAW sections 1.2 and 1.3 of the PWS.<br />III.

<p>IV. Environmental Compliance The contractor shall provide a company capability statement demonstrating knowledge of how to safely manage hazardous materials and which provides a history of environmental compliance IAW 1.4 and 1.5 of the PWS.</p>
<p>The following ratings will be used in rating technical capability:</p>
<p>Acceptable: Proposed clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation<br />Unacceptable: Proposed does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE: Recent and relevant past performance is defined as past performance having occurred in the last 3 years preceding the date of the solicitation issuance. Relevant past performance is defined as past performance providing candidates for services similar in scope to this requirement and complexity. The Government will consider relevancy, recency, extent of the past performance and the size and complexity of the past performance relative to this solicitation's requirement submitted by offerors as well as any information gathered by the Contracting Officer. Offerors that have no relevant past performance history will be assigned an unknown past performance evaluation rating; unknown will be rated as acceptable.</p>
<p>The government will use the following relevancy ratings when assessing recent and relevant contracts:<br />Relevant Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires<br />Not Relevant Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>The following ratings will be used in rating past performance:<br />Rating Description<br />Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort<br />Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />Limited Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />No Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />Unknown Confidence (Neutral) No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(ix) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items Evaluation. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers in the following relative order of importance 1. Technical, 2. Past Performance, and 3. Price. Technical and Past Performance are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL</p>
<p>Initially, the government technical evaluation team shall evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable. Proposals will be evaluated against the following:</p>
<p>Sub Factor 1 - Certifications -</p>
<p>The contractor shall submit applicable registrations/permits/certifications authorizing performance of infectious waste transportation and cleanup/decontamination, to include Ebola scene cleanup. In addition, the contractor shall submit all federal or state registrations/permits/certifications required to transport infectious waste from JB CHS to an approved disposal site.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 - PRICE:<br />Next, the government shall rank all technically acceptable offers by price. Price will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>2<br />FACTOR 3 - PAST PERFORMANCE:<br />Beginning with the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror, the contracting officer shall seek recent and relevant performance information on offerors based on (1) the past efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.</p>
<p>1. Recent performance includes projects performed within the past three years. Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving waste decontamination, collection and transportation services that include category A hazardous waste that involved similar scope, magnitude, and complexities required by the PWS.</p>
<p>Very Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. <br />Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. <br />Somewhat Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. <br />Not Relevant - Present/past performance involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation requirements based on the offeror's demonstrated past performance.</p>
<p>The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence as defined in table below. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no recent/relevant performance history or if the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably (neutral).</p>
<p><br />Table 2. Performance Confidence Assessments<br />Rating Description<br />Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Limited Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />No Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br />Unknown Confidence (Neutral) No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>

<p>DNA sequencing is the process of deciphering the nucleotide (i.e., A, C, T, G) arrangement within a segment of a DNA molecule. This information can be used to identify pest/non-pest species either directly by comparing the DNA sequences (i.e., DNA barcoding) or indirectly by using the sequences to develop alternate DNA-based techniques of analysis. Deciphering the DNA sequence of various species and populations is crucial for the development of all molecular diagnostic tools.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide DNA Sequencing/Fragment Analysis Testing Service for the USDA, Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Center for Plant Health Science and Technology (CPHST). The Center for Plant Health Science and Technology supports PPQ regulatory decisions and operations through methods development work, scientific investigation, analyses and technology. The molecular diagnostics unit of the CPHST is specifically focused on the development of molecular diagnostic tests for arthropods including fruit flies and other invertebrate pests. The DNA is used to make quarantine and regulatory decisions that have associated economic costs. The DNA Sequencing Analysis Testing Service provided shall be performed in accordance with the above specifications and when requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>SPECIFICATIONS:<br />DNA sequencing is performed in two stages. First, a chemical reaction incorporates four different fluorescent dyes to DNA molecules such that each type of nucleotide is specifically labeled. Second, the labeled DNA molecules are separated using an instrument called a DNA Sequencer. The DNA Sequencer includes optical sensors and computer software that can decipher the different dye labels and reconstruct the DNA sequence. These instruments are relatively expensive and are designed to perform optimally using specific chemical dyes, software, and reagents. <br /><br />The APHIS-CPHST Lab in Texas is involved in multiple molecular diagnostic programs that require DNA sequencing of samples. These samples are used to generate new molecular tools and to provide identifications to intercepted invertebrates. In both cases these DNA sequences will be used to make quarantine and regulatory decisions that have associated economic costs. Therefore, we require a DNA sequencing service that can provide DNA sequences with &ge;99% accuracy for at least 800 DNA nucleotides and process requests of up to 500 samples at a time.<br /><br />&nbsp;Due to the time sensitivity of projects requiring this service, the turn-around time for all results to be delivered to USDA, APHIS, and CPHST should be less than two (2) business days from receipt of samples. The failure rate due to combined human error and instrument error must be below 0.5%. The contractor must be able to receive samples sent via overnight shipment and be able to analyze samples sent at room temperature during transport.<br /><br />For this solicitation, if offerors do not provide or meet any of the specifications as stated above, it should be noted on the price schedule submitted.</p>

Some national&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;labs have their own custom package or use ROCKS. There are also <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; commercially supported cluster management tools. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Answer:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The RACF has its own custom cluster management infrastructure. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ROCKS or commercially supported cluster management software is <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not required.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Question:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will the racks and power distribution for the potential scale out be&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; required upfront?

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Answer:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inclusion of racks and power distribution for scale out is not required upfront. We also don't need it itemized. From past experience, these items are a very small fraction of the total cost of the cluster and don't have significant impact on a potential scale out procurement.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Question:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the offeror comes in below budget.

<p><br />Amendment&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;3/31/2016<br />Amendment issued to&nbsp;address the following question:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in">Question:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Please provide more detail on the milestones for the second and third payments.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in">&nbsp;Answer:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The expectation is that the offeror will have an annual discussion with the end-user concerning the cluster system. The offeror&nbsp; would then issue a report summarizing that discussion. Topics could be but not limited to maintenance, diagnostic, performance and usage.</p>
<p>Question:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Please detail a situation where the potential supplier would not meet <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; either of the second or third milestones as an example. <br /><br />Answer:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If they didn't send in an annual report on or before the specified <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; date.</p>

<p>Answer:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, this is not a lease and cannot be considered one.

<br />The U. S. Postal Service plans to issue a Fixed Price Contract to complete a security upgrade project at the Jacksonville FL NDC located at 7415 Commonwealth Drive, Jacksonville, FL 32099. All work will be done in accordance with USPS approved specifications and drawings.
<p>The estimated cost range of the project is $1,900,000 to $2,100,000 with construction completion within 270 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. Contractors must submit a Qualification Statement and a Management Plan with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered.<br />To be considered, a company must meet the following minimum requirements:<br />(1) Contractors must be licensed, as required by the State, to perform the work as stated in this solicitation.<br />(2) Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five-year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five-year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained, this should also be clearly explained. <br />(3) Contractor must be capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for 100% of the contract price.<br />(4) Contractors must provide their EMR rating on insurance company letterhead. If the EMR rating is greater than 1.0, the contractor must provide an explanation from its insurance company in order to be given further consideration for prequalification.<br />(5) Company must submit information for three comparable security projects that have either been completed within the past five years or are currently ongoing. Comparable projects are defined as security projects with similar scopes of work and costs of $1,000,000 or more.</p>
<p>The Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated: experience/performance and capabilities. The price proposals for only the most highly qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>The Postal Service is more concerned with making an award at the lowest overall price than with obtaining superior technical or management features. However, the Postal Service may not necessarily make an award at the lowest price in order to achieve a small price savings if better value can be achieved with superior technical or management features. The benefits of a higher priced proposal may merit a higher price. The evaluation factors outlined in Section 2-26.2, of the Supplying Principles and Practices, listed in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of proposals.</p>
<p>Prequalified contractors will be placed on a list for inclusion in future solicitations in this area with similar scopes of work. There is no guarantee that a specific number of solicitations will be issued to these prequalified contractors.</p>
<p>A PRE PROPOSAL MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE SITE ON MARCH 22, 2016, AT 11:00 A.M. ATTENDANCE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p>The SOLICITATION PACKAGE is attached to this posting.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO Bob Ramba, Robert.c.ramba@usps.gov or Paige Lyne, Jacquelyn.p.lyne@usps.gov. Deadline for questions is noon on 3-29-16.</p>
<p>There will be no public opening of offers. All proposal information received is CONFIDENTIAL until award of a contract. Upon award, the name of the successful offeror and the amount of the contract will be released as public information. The names of offerors and the amount of their offers will not be released as public information. This information is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, Exception 4.</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR Life Raft Pre-Production / Testing &amp; Development. Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued.
<p>The due date for receipt of offers is extended to April 8, 2016.</p>
<p>Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on March 18, 2016. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet. These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.</p>
<p>The purpose of this amendment is to answer the questions below and provide an updated statement of work:</p>
<p>Question 1:</p>
<p>It would seem that the RFQ fails to notes some offeror documents desired upon submission date of 1 April:- the SOW notes the requirement to forward (for evaluation) a program plan and schedule. Is this part of the original proposal?</p>
<p>Answer 1:</p>
<p>Program plan and schedule are due as part of RFP, and&nbsp;tied to the listed milestones. We did not want to force a schedule on a vendor, but rather let them lay the schedule out providing it meets our technical and end-date requirements (26028 weeks for raft delivery, 32 weeks for final documentation delivery).</p>
<p>Question 2:</p>
<p>Copy of the notional or exact interface and packaging desires would be great. May we have this?</p>
<p>Answer 2:</p>
<p>Interfaces are called out in all the document attachments, including desired packed volume, and desired raft human interfaces. No other interfaces will be provided to any vendor, just the desired shape and volume. External interfaces are owned by the government and vehicle contractor for proper integration. The volume/shape was carefully designed and included in the SOW to accommodate for these issues.</p>
<p>Question 3:</p>
<p>Our only question is the requirement of the SOW that: Non- deformation of raft tubes during ingress of 235 lb. test subject. We would like to request that the requirement be reworded. "Minimize" or "Diminish" could replace Non- deformation.</p>
<p>Answer 3:</p>
<p>"Minimize" has&nbsp;replaced "non-deformation" in the updated statement of work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question 4:</p>
<p>Why is this RFQ being offered only as a total small business set-aside? What is the reason this cannot be offered as a full and open solicitation? Opening this up to all businesses would offer NASA the best opportunity for obtaining the lightest, most cost-effective, production-ready technical solution meeting the stated requirements and goals of this solicitation. There are existing commercially available life rafts that can meet the prescribed weight and volume targets, along with all the other stated performance requirements, with little if any design modifications needed. As such the scope of the development effort for companies such as ourselves, with such designs already existing in their current product offerings, would likely be substantially less than firms that may be eligible to participate (as small businesses), but otherwise far less advanced in their development capabilities for such equipment. Why should the astronauts in need of such mission critical equipment be denied the very best that a full and open competition will afford them?</p>
<p>Answer 4:</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 19.502-2(a), "Each acquisition of supplies or services that has an anticipated dollar value exceeding $3,500 ($20,000 for acquisitions as described in 13.201(g)(1)), but not over $150,000 ($300,000 for acquisitions described in paragraph (1) of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold definition at 2.101), is automatically reserved exclusively for small business concerns and shall be set aside for small business unless the contracting officer determines there is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or more responsible small business concerns that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery."</p>
<p>Question 5:</p>
<p>There appears a lack of clarity between the RFQ and the SOW with respect to what exactly is expected in the bid response as far as supporting documents (e.g. project plan and schedule). Is there a particular format desired for the RFQ response to address this?</p>
<p>Answer 5:</p>
<p>Project plan and schedule are acceptable in any commonly-used format (e.g. Microsoft Word, Microsoft Project, Adobe PDF) in order to assess how a company will accomplish the proposed milestones.</p>
<p>Question 6:</p>
<p>Many of the performance requirements listed in the SOW are somewhat vague or open-ended in that they imply certain features of the raft are subject to further discussions with NASA (e.g. options for inflatable ingress ramp systems). While such ramp systems are readily available from our existing product range, their inclusion can impact cost, weight and packed volume. What is NASA's preference? Is it as stated to make the raft mass as light as possible with minimized geometric<br />volume, or are certain higher level performance features such as inflatable ingress ramp systems desired. Should such features be offered as options within the RFQ?</p>
<p>Answer 6:</p>
<p>The entire design spectrum should be offered as options as long as they fall within minimum requirements.</p>
<p>Question 7:</p>
<p>In the SOW, there are Figures (1.0 thru 5.0) appended, with no direct reference to same (with the exception of Figure 3.0 which is referenced twice). Are the other figures binding with respect to the features illustrated, or merely offered as guidance?</p>
<p>Answer 7:</p>
<p>The volume and anthro figures are requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>Question #5: I apologize, but your answers brought up a few more comments/questions:
<p>While the valves as a standard do undergo a shell test at the pressure listed it is normally only a 1 minute test for this size. There would be a<br />price adder for a longer test period.</p>
<p>Also we don't do the "mechanical joint tightness test". If you do a shell<br />test at 1.5x the pressure and it passes doing the exact same test at a lower<br />pressure would not be necessary.</p>
<p>By "mechanical joint tightness test" do you mean a seat test. If that is<br />the case, is the MSS SP71 allowable leakage acceptable?</p>
<p>Answer: The required tests shall be performed independently. The submitted shell test is to prove shell/casting integrity. The mechanical test is to prove bonnet/ joint tightness. An allowable leakage to mechanical joins is allowed during shell/casting integrity test, however a mechanical joint tightness test should allow NO leakage from mechanical joints.</p>
<p>The seat test referred to is an internal flow test, and should be performed by manufacturer as part of their quality assurance. And the leakage allowed by industry standard is acceptable.</p>

<DESC>CLEMENT J. ZABLOCKI MEDICAL CENTER ENHANCED-USE LEASE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, 
MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN (VA10116R0084)
The Site visit is now scheduled for March 11 at 10:30 in the Building 43 Dining Room with registration scheduled to start at 9:30.

This procurement is for an Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) opportunity at the Clement J. Zablocki Medical Center Enhanced-Use Lease Development Project, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The VA objective for this RFP is to receive proposals from one or more Offerors to develop the sites to provide supportive housing to homeless and near homeless individuals, and their families with a preference for Veterans under long-term ground lease agreements with VA for up to seventy-five (75) years. In return for a long-term lease of the property, the selected Offeror(s) will provide fair consideration to VA.
The United States Department of Veterans Affairs ("Department" or "VA") on behalf of the CLEMENT J. ZABLOCKI VA Medical Center is soliciting competitive proposals from private, public, and/or not-for-profit development offers in leasing and developing the subject property as described in the attached RFP.
The Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The Medical Center (VAMC) has Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) in Appleton and Green Bay, serving 11 counties in North Central Wisconsin; in Union Grove, serving 4 counties in Southeastern Wisconsin, and in Cleveland, serving 4 counties in East Central Wisconsin.
The VAMC delivers primary, secondary, and tertiary medical care in 194 acute care beds (including Psychosocial Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs) and provides 600,000+ outpatient visits annually through an extensive outpatient program. The Community Living Center (long term care) units of 113 operating beds offer geriatric programming that preserves and enhances the patient's dignity.  The 356 operating domiciliary beds are the focus of several innovative programs, including an Alcohol/Drug Rehabilitation Unit, a Rehabilitation and Treatment Unit for Veterans with chronic mental health problems, and a Transitional Program that helps Veterans successfully return to life in the community.
The Medical Center also assists the Veterans Center located in the City of Milwaukee. In addition, the Milwaukee VAMC has maintained a partnership with the Center for Veterans Issues (CVI) for the provision of grant and per diem services for homeless Veterans at two sites in Milwaukee and Union Grove, Wisconsin (Vets Place Central, in Milwaukee and the Veterans Assistance Program in Union Grove).  All of Milwaukee's programs serve a Veteran population of 321,421 in the southeastern and central parts of Wisconsin (Central Market Veteran population for 2005).  The VAMC is a part of Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 12, which includes the Iron Mountain VAMC in Michigan; Tomah VAMC in Wisconsin, William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin, North Chicago VA Medical Center in Illinois (future site of the Lovell Federal Ambulatory Care Center), Edward Hines, Jr., VA Hospital in Chicago Illinois, and the Jesse Brown VAMC in Chicago.
Special programs include interventional radiology, cardiac surgery, comprehensive cancer care including radiation therapy, an extensive telemedicine program with Iron Mountain, MI VAMC, a Spinal Cord Injury Unit, and, in long term care, a Geriatric Evaluation and Management Program and a palliative care program. The Medical Center is the VA Great Lakes Health Care System's northern, tier hub for both imaging, and pathology/laboratory medicine.

<DESC>ANNOUCEMENT: Potential Print Providers are invited to a Telecon that will be held February 5th, 2016 3:00PM-4:30PM EST. Please RSVP to Charlesette.D.Parris@faa.gov. Telecon details are provided under attachment labeled "INFO Feb 5 Telecon". 

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES:  The FAA seeks to transition from printing and distribution operations for all aeronautical chart products to products Available on Demand (AOD).  The FAA is seeking commercial industry solutions to provide a variety of aeronautical chart products.  The vision is for Print Provider Agreements to enable the FAA to operate more efficiently and allow the FAA to respond to the needs of the organization and public more quickly and easily.  Understanding that the needs of the public are changing, through AOD, the FAA will be able to shift resources from printing/distributing to finding innovative ways to provide the chart products and information.

PURPOSE:  The purpose of providing the draft agreement and other documents is to gather information about vendor capabilities and determine interest in providing available-on-demand platforms for aeronautical charts

NOTE: The draft agreement is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a Request for Proposal, or as a contract or commitment of any kind, nor as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  The Government shall not be liable for payment of any costs attributed to the preparation and submission of requested market research information, capability briefings or other documentation submitted in response to this announcement. There is no entitlement to payment by the FAA of direct or indirect costs or charges that are incurred as a result of submission of responses to this announcement.

<NTYPE>SNOTE
<CONTACT>Carver, Mary
<DESC>Notice of Intent to Issue Sole Source Award

The Department of the Interior (DOI), Interior Business Center (IBC), Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) intends to issue a sole source Purchase Order under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items to AT&T Technical Services Company, Inc. (AT&T-TSCO) to provide the Executive Office of the President (EOP) continued support services for Voice Systems Operations and Maintenance (VSOM) telecommunications. Examples of the services provided under VSOM include all switches, switch software, voice mail, associated administrative systems, primary port network, expansion port network, and all voice terminals.

This sole-source action will result in awarding a hybrid Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) / Time and Materials (T&M) Purchase Order to AT&T-TSCO effective May 24, 2016 under FAR Part 13  Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.5  Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. This sole source Purchase Order is a temporary solution to continue support of EOPs legacy IT system in order to allow sufficient time for EOP to implement Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). It is anticipated that the Purchase Order will be for a 3-month base and two (2) 3-month option periods.

A single source, AT&T TSCO, has been identified to have the unique qualifications to fulfill the requirement. They are uniquely qualified as they have in-depth knowledge in working with EOP and have extensive historical technical knowledge, skills, and abilities of the VSOM requirement. AT&T TSCO is uniquely qualified to provide the services in the short-term until the full implementation of VoIP. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the government to procure this on a sole source basis to AT&T TSCO.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. A solicitation is not available. However, firms that believe they can provide these services in their entirety must submit a written notification of interest and capability to the Contracting Officer by the date and time indicated below. AQD will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. This notice in no way obligates the Government to award any Purchase Order. No telephone requests will be honored.

Inquiries will only be accepted via e-mail to mary_carver@ibc.doi.gov and chiharu_bullock@ibc.doi.gov. The Government will consider responses received by 5:00PM, Eastern Time, April 07, 2016. 

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 517919 Other Telecommunications and the size standard is $32.5 Million.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for up to three (3) stand-alone Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order Contracts to provide a full range of General Facilities Construction (GFC) services. These services will be in support of primarily the National Weather Services (NWS), Eastern Region (ER), System Operation Division (SOD) which has responsibility for facilities and projects in the eastern half of the nation. Also, these contracts may be used by other components of NOAA and the DOC for similar requirements. The Government intends to award up to three (3) stand-alone contracts consisting of a five-year base period. This action will not result in multiple award task order contracts (MATOCs). Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed-price basis. &nbsp;

<p>The Total Acquisition Value for each of the contracts is $3.3 million. Services will be implemented through individual task orders and will be issued when need arises during the contract period. The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered; however, a minimum of $25,000 is guaranteed to be ordered during the performance period of each contract. The Contractor is not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.</p>
<p>This is a 100% set-aside for Small Business.  The Government will evaluate the performance capability of offerors in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation. The solicitation will include a detailed list of Evaluation Factors and will provide instructions for Proposal Requirements and the Basis for Award. Proposals received in response to the solicitation will be evaluated in accordance with procedures outlined in FAR Part 15 for Best Value.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction), with a small business size standard of $36.5 million in average annual receipts. Prior experience with Government contract work is not required for submitting a proposal; however, prior experience with construction of comparable facility projects of similar size, complexity, and cost range is required.</p>
<p>Interested offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM). Firms can register via the SAM internet web-site at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. If the offeror is a Joint Venture (JV), the JV entity must have valid SAM registration in the SAM database representing the JV as one business/firm/entity. If at the time of award an offeror is not successfully and actively registered in the SAM database, the Government reserves the right to award to the next prospective offeror.</p>
<p>A Proposal Guarantee may be required with your proposal in the amount of 20% of the offeror's proposed price or $3,000,000, whichever is less.</p>
<p>Payment and Performance Bonds may be required for the full amount (100%) of each awarded task order.</p>
<p>The solicitation and associated information will be available from the FedBizOpps website https://www.fbo.gov. This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments prior to closing; therefore, it is the offeror's responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to the solicitation.</p>

The estimated value of these services for the base year is $80,736.00 with the potential of four option years. The total estimated value of the procurement including option years is $492,888.00. The period of performance for the base year is April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2017. The fourth option year would end on March 31, 2021.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:

( X ) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
(  ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
( ) (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
(  ) (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
(  ) (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5; (  ) (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
 
(  ) (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contr ac tor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  The AVAHCS is located in a market area or region where there is only one Cable Television Subscription Services provider. AVAHCS Engineering advises that AT&T is in the process of building a fiber optics backbone in Amarillo so they can offer U-verse entertainment packages, but that is still a couple of years away. AVAHCS Engineering further advises for this facility to unilaterally shift to satellite, the purchase of at least 70 channels of satellite receiver equipment would be required. In order to accommodate the new equipment, a construction project to enlarge the server bay where the equipment would reside would be necessary. The AVAHCS would also have to purchase off-air equipment so as to continue  to provide emergency coverage of local stations when the weather prevents satellite reception.     For the reasons cited in this paragraph (construction of server bay, altering the facility, etc.),            the costs of transitioning to a satellite provider would not be advantageous to the Government as there would be a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  A Source Sought Notice was posted on FedBizOpps on December 29, 2015 and closed on January 7, 2016. The notice number is VA258-16-Q-0095_1. No vendors responded. NCO18/AVAHCS intends to award a firm-fixed-price via "other than full and open competition" contract with a large business, Cebridge Acquisition L.P. DBA Suddenlink Communications, located at 3015 Southeast Loop 323, Tyler, TX. 75701-7320 for a base plus four option years.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  Market research was conducted IAW FAR Part 10. Suddenlink meets the Government's minimum needs, and pricing is comparable to previous procurements. The pricing/cost and other factors considered represents the best value to the Government. The estimated value of these services for the base year is $80,736.00 with the potential of four option years. This is for a total of 490 cable drops with approximately 49 channels of programming on each drop. The estimated cost per drop per month for the base year is $13.73. The total estimated value of the procurement including option years is $492,888.00. The COR accounted for an estimated 10% per year increase in price per their standard procedure.

Further research on the FedBizOpps website for cable television subscription services revealed the following information for similar services at other Government facilities:

Facility Name	Award Date	Award Amount	Number of Drops	Approximate amount per drop, per month
Saint Louis VA Health Care System	10/2/2015	$37,137.99	200	$15.47
Department of Homeland Security - Federal Law Enforcement Training Center	9/28/2015	$131,535.72	1,072	$10.23

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted: As described in Section 7 above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquiries from interested parties.
 
9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: Per Section 5 above, the AVAHCS is located in a market area or region where there is only one Cable Television Subscription Services provider. The costs of transitioning to a satellite provider would not be advantageous to the Government as there would be a substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:

Cebridge Acquisition L.P.
DBA Suddenlink Communications 3015 Southeast Loop 323
Tyler, TX 75701-7320

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: Market research has been conducted to identify other vendors who meet the Government's needs for cable television subscription services, and there are no other vendors within the area or region serving the AVAHCS at this time. It is the intent of the AVAHCS to conduct market research on future requirements to include the issuance of a RFI/Sources Sought Notice to identify other television subscription services vendors who may be interested in participating in future requirements to promote maximum competition.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona  Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and
 
belief.

LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION ORDER >$150,000
FAR PART 8.405-6

 
Acquisition Plan Action ID:
 
VA243-16-AP-1296
 

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below.

Restricted to the following source: Provide original manufacturer's name for material or contractor's name for service. (If a sole source manufacturer distributes via dealers, ALSO provide dealer information.)

Manufacturer/Contractor: General Electric Company 	 Manufacturer/Contractor POC & phone number: Matt Harrison (919) 244-8792 	 Mfgr/Contractor Address: General Electric Company/3000 GRANDVIEW BLVD 4-443, WAUKESHA, WI 53188-1615

Dealer/Rep address/phone number: GE Healthcare (800) 345-2700 	

The requested material or service represents the minimum requirements of the Government.

(1)	AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:	Department of Veterans Affairs (632) 	
Northport VA Medical Center 		 79 Middleville Road 			 Northport, NY 11768 	

VISN: 3

(2)	NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:

A Firm-fixed-price full service maintenance contract to cover support of RADIATION ONCOLOGY CT SIMULATOR, ECHOPACS, VIVD q, VIVID E9/TEE PROBE and GE PRECISION 500D RADIOGRAPHIC
/FLUOROSCOPIC X-RAY Systems located at the VAMC Northport


(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:

This service contract is to provide hardware and software emergency repairs/corrections, routine corrective maintenance and preventative maintenance on the original equipment manufacturer's equipment for a period of one year, Fiscal Year 2016. Currently, Biomedical Engineering does not have factory trained and authorized staff to support this equipment.

(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE: $226,647.00 	

(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE:   4/01/2016 	
 

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE. (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.). Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.

 

 

A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition. The proprietary data is:
 	(If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting. Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)

Only General Electric (GE) has ready access to their own Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM) software, including revisions/updates designed to correct identified performance problems or software errors which are covered by the contract. The OEM is uniquely qualified to ensure that all updates are immediately available, properly installed and tested. A non-OEM authorized third-party vendor would not be notified of factory-issued software updates and upgrades. They would not have access to factory diagnostic software tools which could result in their inability to repair, and/or major turn-around-time delays in repair.  Third -party service providers would not have access to copies of or knowledge of the OEM-proprietary software which resides on the system.
Non-OEM service provides would also not have factory-trained field-service representatives since medical equipment OEMs do not offer training to third-party service providers or give them authorization to maintain their systems.  A prior employee of the OEM working for a third-party would also not have access to the latest factory-issued circuit and software revisions and updates. The original equipment manufacturer (OEM) FSEs are fully-factory-trained, qualified and experienced in the maintenance inspections and repair requirements. Most importantly, the FSEs have a full understanding of the entire system, including its software.

Indirect access to OEM-manufactured spare parts would jeopardize repair turn-around time, and that is if one can assume that the OEM will even sell the parts to a non-hospital organization such as a third- party service provider.


These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.

 

 

The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing. Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.

 

 

 
 

The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures.

 

 

An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays.

 

 

(4)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:

The hospital-based Biomedical Engineering industry has an expectation that service contracts will cost anywhere from 8-10 percent of the original asset value of the equipment, sometimes even more where software based systems are concerned. $226,647.00 is a WITHIN THAT that standard, since it is 10.7
% of the original asset value of the equipment which was $2,070,727.00.

(5)	DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:

As this is a request for other than full and open competition, no other sources have been deemed suitable offerors, nor are we aware of any existing offerors which could possibly meet our needs other than the OEM, GE.
(6)	ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:

Delays associated with repair of major medical systems which provide diagnosis, surgical intervention, treatment for life threatening diseases and life-support are not tolerated because they result in study/treatment cancellations, additional cost to transfer patients to other institutions, and in certain instances can result in loss of life. The usage of third-party vendors to provide service for sophisticated, highly-complex, software-based systems is unheard of throughout the hospital community. There is too much liability when patient lives are at stake, particularly with respect to anesthesia for surgical  patients.   Poorly maintained systems can fail in the middle of a surgical procedure.   The only acceptable alternatives to hospitals and OEMs is to factory -train in-house Biomedical Engineering Technicians to provide "first-call" troubleshooting or higher-level support with the full back-up support of the OEM immediately available.
(7)	A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
 


A third-party source would never be qualified to support this system, per statements in Paragraph 4, therefore, there are no barriers to be removed to open competition.
(8) REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge. I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4. (This signature is the requestor's supervisor, fund control point official, chief of service or someone with responsibility and accountability.)
