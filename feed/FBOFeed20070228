<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. 

The General Services Administration?s Federal Technology Service solicits your response to the attached RFQ.  We invite you to submit a proposal for satisfying the requirements described in this RFQ.  Please submit all required information before the specified closing date and in accordance with the instructions set forth in the RFQ.

Vendors are encouraged to review the RFQ carefully and submit any questions and comments via email no later than 4:00PM, Eastern Time, on 03/07/2007 to both Rick.Yao@gsa.gov and Edward.Lew@gsa.gov.  The responses to questions received will be issued shortly thereafter.  Quotes shall be received NLT 03/09/2007, 5:00pm EDT via email by Rick.yao@gsa.gov.  In order to be considered for award, offerors must be registered with IT Solution. Award will only be made through IT Solutions. The website is http://it-solutions.gsa.gov. If vendor registration assistance is needed, please contact the help desk at 877.243.2889. 

The installation and use of the MPCS has been directed by NAVAIR Headquarter.  As a part of the NAVAIR refreshing effort in upgrading the MPCS used for prototyping, testing and producing of mission essential Fleet products, the Navy requires the HP Integrity Server (Itanium Based) as part of the upgrade that runs the HP OpenVMS Operating System (OS), a key software/business application that supports the MPCS.  Market Research identified that MPCS can only be supported by the HP OpenVMS OS and cannot be supported by other OS.  OpenVMS OS is proprietary to HP and is only supported on the Integrity Server (Itanium Based) that HP manufactures.  No other company but HP makes Integrity Server.  HP does not support OpenVMS on other manufacturer?s servers, and no other manufacturer of similar computer servers can support HP?s OpenVMS.  NAVAIR has specified the HP Integrity Server because its technical performance characteristics best meet the Navy?s requirements.  

Award shall be made based on cost and non cost factors, price and delivery date. Price is more important than delivery date. 

Delivery: Specify best possible earliest delivery.

Offerors are expected to examine this entire RFQ and complete all required attachments.  Failure to do so will be considered non responsive and will not be considered for award.  

For additional information concerning this RFQ, please contact Rick.Yao@gsa.gov at 212-264-8345 or Edward.Lew@gsa.gov at 212-264-4782.

<DESC>Summary Requirement:
The General Services Administration is seeking to lease approximately 6,245 rentable square feet of space yielding approximately 5,445 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (previously Usable) for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to house personnel, furnishings, and equipment, together with adequate parking including nine (9) reserved spaces.

GSA currently has a lease that is expiring and is interested in considering alternative space if relocation is economically advantageous to the Government.  In making such a determination, GSA will consider cost factors including, but not limited to, the total cost of the physical move (including telecommunications and computer cabling costs); tenant improvement costs (whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent); and anticipated rent for the space.

The building offered must not contain sprayed on fireproofing or acoustical treatment containing asbestos.  An award of contract will not be made for a property located within a base flood plain or wetland unless the Government has determined it to be the only practicable alternative.

Location / Delineated Area:
North:  Koolau Range
South:  Kamehameha Highway
East:  Middle Street
West:  Kaneohe Street

<DESC>THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ACCEPT TELEPHONED, E-MAILED, LETTER-WRITTEN, OR FAXED REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION (RFP) FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.  Instead, all prospective offerors (bidders) MUST obtain the Solicitation from the FedBizOpps website, whose address is:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov .  The Pre-Solicitation Notice (Synopsis) that you are now reading is NOT the Solicitation; the Solicitation will be published HEREAFTER in the FedBizOpps website.  The procurement announced in this Pre-Solicitation Notice is FULL-AND-OPEN-COMPETITIVE, and it will be a FOLLOW-ON project.  For this follow-on project, the FHWA plans to award one and only one fixed-price contract, which will have a ten-year Period of Performance and NO task orders.   The INCUMBENT contractor is Mobility Technologies, Inc., located at Chesterbrook Corporate Center, 851 Duportail Road, Suite 220, Wayne, PA 19087.  Under that incumbent or precursor contract, numbered DTTS59-99-D-00445 and entitled ? Intelligent Transportation Infrastructure Program (ITIP) Support?, the incumbent, since October of 2001, has been working with U.S.DOT to integrate the traffic data from existing surveillance infrastructure of 25 metropolitan areas that are eligible to participate in ITIP and strategic deployment of supplemental surveillance infrastructure to support the provision of both real-time and archived roadway system performance data. The 25 eligible metropolitan areas chosen to participate as follows: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, Chicago, Columbus, Detroit, Greensboro, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Norfolk, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, Providence, Raleigh/Durham, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, St. Louis, Seattle, Tampa, and Washington D.C.  Briefly, the deployments in each metropolitan area feature the following: Public /private partnership for the provision of data services to the public agency partners; Up to 100 sensors deployed in each metropolitan area, primarily along freeways and other major arterials, capable of providing data on volume, speed, lane occupation, and limited vehicle classification; Archived database function;  Commercialization component to enable self sufficiency; Free web-based access to real-time as well as archived data for public agency stakeholders; Free web-based basic traffic condition information to the general public (www.traffic.com); Additional value-added commercial services on a fee basis; Private funding contribution toward infrastructure;  Firm, fixed price contract where private partner owns, operates, and maintains the system; Sharing of gross revenues to support system enhancements; and Reliability performance measure calculations and reports provided on a monthly basis.   The follow-on project synopsized here is a CONTINUATION of the above-mentioned work done by Mobility Technologies, Inc..  Mobility Technologies, Inc. IS eligible to COMPETE for the follow-on project announced in this Pre-Solicitation Notice.  Mobility Technologies Inc.?s  point of contact is Mr. John Collins, who can be reached at the following e-mail address:  JCollins@Traffic.com.   Although telephone numbers for Mobility Technologies, Inc. and for Mr. John Collins are obtainable on the Internet, prospective offerors for this follow-on project who wish to contact Mobility Technologies, Inc. are asked to use Mr. John Collins? e-mail address rather than calling him.  Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for copies of  Mobility Technologies, Inc.?s INCUMBENT contract document are unlikely to be fruitful for organizations wishing to compete for this FOLLOW-ON project, for the following reasons:  (a) the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) routinely REDACTS, from contract documents furnished to FOIA requesters, all pricing data and all staffing data; (b) the Statement of Work that will be published hereafter in the Solicitation (RFP) for this FOLLOW-ON project will be self-contained and will stand alone and will DIFFER in many crucial respects from the Statement of Work set forth in Mobility Technologies Inc.?s INCUMBENT contract document; (c) any attempt, by an offeror submitting a proposal for this follow-on project, to respond to the INCUMBENT contract?s Statement of Work would almost certainly call into serious question the offeror?s grasp of, and commitment to attaining, the technical objectives of this follow-on project; and (d) given the time-consuming procedure governing the FHWA?s processing of FOIA requests, it is unlikely that even an extensively redacted and probably useless copy of  Mobility Technologies Inc.?s INCUMBENT contract document could be made available to any FOIA requester before the due date for submitting PROPOSALS under this follow-on procurement.  

The contractor performing this follow-on project will deploy Part II of what is known as the Transportation Technology Innovation and Demonstration (TTID) program into the Dallas / Fort Worth metropolitan area.  TTID Part II was authorized by Section 5508 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Act:  A Legacy for Users (also known as ?SAFETEA-LU?), which can be found in Public Law 109-59 or at 119 Stat. 1824.  It is anticipated that the deployment of TTID Part II in Dallas / Fort Worth will help to achieve SAFETEA-LU?s goal of providing private technology commercialization initiatives as part of a program to ?advance the deployment of an operational intelligent transportation infrastructure system, through measurement of various transportation system activities, to simultaneously (I) aid in transportation planning and analysis; and (II) make a significant contribution to the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) program?.  Specifically, the contractor for this follow-on project will:  (1) create, in the Dallas / Fort Worth metropolitan area, a regional transportation information and communications system that integrates and supplements existing surveillance infrastructure to support public sector transportation management needs and private sector commercialization; and (2) install and operate, as a part of the system created in the Dallas / Forth metropolitan area, one hundred new traffic sensors.   The system created and installed in the Dallas / Fort Worth metropolitan area under this follow-on project shall:  (a) collect, integrate, archive, manage, distribute and report new and existing transportation data for mobility and performance monitoring, planning, evaluation, public information, and other similar purposes; (b) accommodate and integrate existing transportation data collection, archiving, and dissemination mechanisms; and (c) include a data repository of new and existing real-time traveler and related information for dissemination through a variety of delivery mechanisms including: (1) provision of free real-time traveler information on the Internet to the public for personal use; (2) provision of data to support real-time 511 based telephone service and Dynamic Message Sign (DMS) service authorized by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) at no charge to TxDOT; (3) provision of archived historical data to TxDOT and to the U. S. Department of Transportation and to their public-sector agents over the Internet; and (4) provision of data to commercial customers as determined by the contractor.  It is estimated that the performance of this ten-year follow-on project will require a total of 1440  labor-hours to be worked by ONE Program Manager, who must be NAMED in each offeror?s INITIALLY-submitted written proposal for this follow-on project.  The Program Manager SHALL possess a Master degree in one of the following disciplines: Engineering, Physics, or Computer Sciences.  The Program Manager shall possess at least 10  years of experience in the research, development and application of systems engineering, systems integration or software development, and shall possess at least five years of experience in managing a group of engineers in this field; but that five years of managerial experience could overlap with, or be contained within, the 10 years of research and development experience.  The Program Manager SHALL possess skills and knowledge that include demonstrated success in keeping programs on schedule and within budget while meeting performance goals of contracts managed, and demonstrated success in effectively managing multiple subcontractors, and shall possess a thorough knowledge of ITS.  It is also estimated that this follow-on project will require an aggregate total of 858 labor-hours to be worked by one or more individuals serving in Senior Level Staff positions.  Each particular Senior Level Staff person must be NAMED in an offeror?s INITIALLY-submitted written proposal for this follow-on project.  Each particular Senior Level Staff person shall possess a Bachelor?s degree in one of the following disciplines: Engineering or Computer Science.  Each particular Senior Level staff person shall possess 5 years of experience with several applicable hardware devices, computers, LAN/WAN environments and systems engineering and integration.  Each Senior Level Staff person should be able to provide analytical problem solving abilities and perform technical troubleshooting.  Additionally, it is estimated that this follow-on project will require an aggregate total of 1306 labor-hours to be worked by one or more individuals serving in Mid-Level Staff positions.  Each particular Mid-Level staff person SHALL possess two or more years of experience in:  software development from concept to production to operation; software design; software construction; and software testing and software maintenance.  Each particular Mid-Level staff person SHOULD have a Bachelor?s degree in Computer science.  Also, it is estimated that this follow-on project will require an aggregate total of 746 labor-hours to be worked by one or more individuals serving in Junior Level Staff positions.  Each particular Junior Level Staff person should possess a degree relevant to this project and shall be capable of designing and developing the traffic database architecture and administrating the database.  Finally, it is estimated that this follow-on project will require an aggregate total of 3180 labor-hours for Administrative Support persons.  Each individual proposed as an Administrative Support Staff person shall have skills in word processing, graphical illustration, desktop publishing and mailing list software, and shall have the ability to turn products of technical staff into documents and presentations of specified formats and of high quality, including camera-ready copy for publications, and the ability to distribute such materials promptly to mailing lists of reviewers and participants.  Each proposed Administrative Support Staff member shall possess at least one year of work experience in rendering general office support, but such experience need not necessarily be in a transportation-related field.  Each proposed Administrative Support Staff member shall, at a minimum, possess an associate?s degree in any field, whether related to this project or not.   Except as is stated in the immediately following sentence, the estimated numbers of staffing hours given above are aggregate totals counted across ONLY the FIRST TWO YEARS of the contract?s Period of Performance (i.e., the project?s deployment period).  The aggregate numbers of estimated staffing hours given above for the Program Manager and for Administrative Support are counted not only across the project?s first two years, but also across the project?s final eight years; and in those final eight years it is anticipated that the contractor will provide monthly reports and performance measurements.  THE LABOR HOURS GIVEN FOR EACH LABOR CATEGORY ARE ESTIMATES ONLY.  THE FHWA DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE CONTRACTOR WILL ACTUALLY END UP PERFORMING THE ESTIMATED NUMBERS OF STAFFING HOURS.  PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS SHOULD NOTE THAT THE FHWA FEELS THAT THE ABOVE-MENTIONED LABOR CATEGORIES MAY BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THE PROJECT.  ANY PROPOSED DEVIATION FROM THE ESTIMATED STAFFING STRUCTURE GIVEN ABOVE WILL BE EXAMINED AND EVALUATED WITHIN THE OVERALL CONTEXT OF THE OFFEROR'S PROPOSAL.  Offerors for this follow-on project should probably ALREADY have a system in place-----in which case the successful offeror (i.e., the contractor for this follow-on project) would be integrating this follow-on project?s data into the contractor?s existing system.  The operation and maintenance of the data of this follow-on project will be a part of the work performed by the contractor over the contract?s ten-year Period of Performance, and should be a part of the normal routine maintenance of the contractor?s system.  Congress has set the total MAXIMUM FEDERAL price of this follow-on project at two million dollars.  But in ADDITION to that MAXIMUM of two-million dollars to be paid to the contractor by the Federal Highway Administration, the CONTRACTOR must ITSELF provide five hundred thousand dollars worth of cost-SHARING for this follow-on project, and that cost-sharing must be derived from NON-Federal sources.  THE DUE DATE FOR THE FHWA?S RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS, AS PUBLISHED IN THIS PRE-S0LICITATION NOTICE, IS ONLY AN ESTIMATED DUE DATE.  THE ACTUAL DUE DATE FOR THE FHWA?S RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS WILL BE STATED ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SOLICITATION (RFP) HEREAFTER PUBLISHED IN THIS SAME FedBizOpps WEBSITE.  The FHWA?s best current ESTIMATE is that the Solicitation MIGHT be published in this FedBizOpps website on or about March 30, 2007.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Ralph W. Earl Co., Inc., 5930 E. Molloy Rd, Syracuse, NY 13211-2109, for the purchase of five (5) Caster Kit, Retrofit.  Retrofit kit consisting of one set of four leveling caster assemblies with mounts and ratcheting adjustment handles to be inetgrated into existing reconfigurable display module (RDM) frame; each caster height is to be independently adjustable with a stroke range of 2", and must adequately sustain weight of RDM when fully extended; each caster wheel will also have a brake.  Information received within 7 days after date of publication of the solicitation will be considered by the Government. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   The NAICS code is 811310.  

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:  

AFRL/IFSB is developing a Reconfiguabel Display Module (RDM) to jsupport a collaboration with NASA Ames Research Center to develop Mantional Airspace System visualization concepts and display technology, but will in turn serve as an AFRL/IF visualization and display system resource.  Each RDM provide a virually frameless rigid screen; fully adjustable, folded-optics mirror system; and a 6 degree of freedom projector mounting system.  The RDMs have been designed to be a mobile, collapsible frame to allow respositioning in a variety of multi-screen display configurations.  The following kit improves upon the current frame procured from Ralph W. Warl Co., Inc. by integrating a set of casters that have independently adjustable height.  It will provide a mechanism for an RDM to be accurately leveled while still maintaining its mobility for repositioning.  It allows the frame to benefit from the latest design improvements without complete frame replacement.  The kit is specifically designed to fit the existing display module frames without compromising its ability to clear a standard 3" doorway when collapsed.  The proposed source, Ralph W. Earl Co., Inc., is the only known source that can satisfy the government's requirement for a collapsible display module compatibility and meet our specificiations.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC)/Specialized Contracts Office (PIK) invites prospective contractors to review the Draft Request for Proposal FA8802-06-R-0001.  It is the intent of SMC/PIC to award multiple Firm Fixed Price Level of Effort Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts to support the purchase of Space and Missiles Systems Center Technical Support.  All questions and comments are to be submitted to the contracting officer by the closing date.  The closing date for this announcement is 30 March 2007. The NAICS Code for this action is 541710, paragraph 11c which defines a small business as 1,000 employees. This draft solicitation for STS is for small business competition. SMC/PIK allows contractors to form teaming relationships for this effort.  Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.  Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, and 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.  Industry responses, particularly from small and small disadvantaged business, will be used to evaluate the existing acquisition strategy.  The STS requirement is for the acquisition of technical services covering the following four core competencies: Systems Engineering, Specialty Engineering, Developmental Planning, and Support Engineering.  The ordering period under these IDIQ contracts is anticipated to be sixty months from date of contract award and the estimated ceiling value is subject to change.  To prevent conflicting roles, which may bias the contractor's judgment or objectivity, and to preclude the contractor from obtaining an unfair competitive advantage in concurrent or future acquisitions, the contractor will be required to accept an Organizational Conflict of Interest clause in the IDIQ contract.  In order to be eligible for award of a delivery order, additional Organizational conflict of Interest restrictions may be imposed by the government.  The contractor must possess, or be able to obtain, an Industrial Facility Clearance of Top Secret at the time of award. Personnel supporting activities under these IDIQ contracts must be US citizens and have a minimum of a secret security clearance. The contractor must have several personnel with Top Secret clearances to support requirements that may be awarded. The place of performance will occur at SMC, its Detachments or the contractor's facility.  Industry responses, particularly from small and small disadvantaged businesses, will be used to evaluate the existing acquisition strategy and the Government reserves the right to cancel one or both STS solicitations.  Potential contractors and other interested parties must obtain the Draft RFP and its associated attachments at Website http://www.fedbizopps.gov/index.html . Please contact Mr. Kerment Goss, (310) 653-1319 or Cap R. Dean Fisher, (310) 653-1341 if you have any questions.

Specifically, comprehensive systems engineering support is required for three (approximately 24-month) Block Cycle deliveries of System Network Controller (SNC) software, and associated changes to the NILE Products (the SNC, the NILE Reference System (NRS), the Multi Link System Test and Training Tool (MLST3)) and associated documentation. These services involve: analyzing and providing specific SNC and NRS software evolution as identified by the NILE Program Management Office (PMO); correcting SNC and NRS software and hardware defects arising during the ISS Phase; and providing engineering support to the NILE PMO to assist the NILE nations in their integration efforts of the NILE components.    This requirement is subject to an International Agreements Memorandum (IAM) limiting competition to prime and first-tier subcontractors from the NILE nations.  SPAWAR intends to issue a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract with a base year, an option year, and four one-year award terms, for a total possible period of performance of six years.  The Request For Proposal (RFP) will be issued in March 2007 with an anticipated award date late in calendar year 2007.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), National  Risk Management Research Center (NRMRL), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with Miami University of Ohio, for Fabrication and Testing of Surface Corona Discharge-Catalytic Reactor for Oxidative Treatment of Waste Gas Emissions from Pulp and Paper Industry.  The current NAICS code is 541710. Based on the EPA's knowledge of technical support needed for the Statement of Work (SOW), the fact that Phase I of the initial  requirement was completed by the Miami University's Paper Science and Engineering Department and the unique skill, experience and knowledge required for testing of this new advanced oxidation technology of the pulp and paper industry is dependent on this sole source.  The background behind this EPA  requirement is as follows: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement to fabribate and test the application of a novel surface corona discharge ozone generator with a catalytic reactor for partial and deep oxidation of air emission streams, from Kraft pulp and paper mills.   This requirement is intended to scale-up the new, patent-pending, oxidation technology and to test its performance at an existing pulping mill.  Additionally, it is intended to assist with the transition of this technology from the laboratory to real world application, by building and testing a  field-scale system.  The EPA intends to demonstrate effectively an economical clean oxidation technology for removing pollutants in the waste gas streams of an integrated Kraft mill.  Both deep oxidation of pollutants to innocuous compounds such as carbon dioxide and water and partial oxidation  of waste gases to value-added compounds will be investigated. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting the EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of  contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to  conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710.  Please submit your request in writing to Scott A. Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov or fax your request to (513) 487-2107.  No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC>PEO STRI is planning a $33 million sole-source modification to existing Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract no. N61339-07-D-0007 with MPRI, Inc. to extend the present period of performance from a three-year base period to a five-year base period, with options for an additional three years.  The planned modification will increase the maximum quantities to be procured from $9M to $42M for the following items: Various Laser Marksmanship Training Systems (LMTS); New Equipment Training (NET) on the LMTS; and 3 years of Total System Performance Requirements (TSPR) or no-fault extended warranty.  This modification is being executed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Due to the transitioning of contracting activities, this requirement may be awarded as a new IDIQ under the cognizant Army contracting office versus a modification to the existing Navy contract.  The LMTS fulfills crucial US Government approved marksmanship training requirements.  It has to support single or multi-lane individual training for stationary dismounted individual/team/squad/section levels in combat, combat support and combat service support.  The LMTS is lightweight, highly mobile, transportable by individual soldiers and is able to operate in the field under austere conditions (rain, snow, heat, humidity) without any fixed facility support and is used in conjunction with the soldier's actual weapon, optics and accessories.

<DESC>This activity will work on building the trade and business enabling environment in Haiti by providing support to the Government of Haiti and private sector associations.  The work carried out under this activity will support the Government?s efforts to engage internationally on trade policy and increase the private sector?s capacity to advocate on trade and investment issues.  It will build on on-going USAID projects in the areas of association development and maritime security, as well as on the important USAID initiative underway to facilitate investment in Haiti.  Increased public-private dialogue will be a key element to I-TRADE.  This activity will be expected to complement other USAID activities that seek to enhance production and the development of market value chains by addressing the internal and external barriers to trade.

The performance-based Contract to be awarded will aim to increase trade opportunities as well as the capacity of Haitians to take advantage of these opportunities through access to investment and trade information.  As a result, USAID expects to see clear linkages between the I-TRADE project and related USAID development projects in the area of market development, and the resulting contribution to the number of Haitians involved in sustainable economic activities.

<DESC>Description:   Design, Development, Integration, Testing, Implementation, Deployment, Training, and Maintenance of the Next Generation Identification (NGI).

Request for Comments (RFC):

This is Part I of a two part RFC.  Part I consists of the following documents posted on FedTeds:  Instructions for Responding to the RFC, and a draft Request for Proposal (Sections B through M).  Part II (to be released on FedTeds on 3/7/2007) will contain the NGI IAFIS System Requirements Document.
This is an RFC, not a Request for Proposal/Request for Quotation (RFP/RFQ).  This information is being sought for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the FBI.  No solicitation exists; therefore, please do not request a copy of a solicitation.  If in the future a solicitation is released, there is no guarantee that sources responding to this RFC will be included on the source list.  This RFC is intended to gain information from integrators, developers, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) and other biometric search solution providers, test organizations, etc. to aid the FBI in providing clarity to a future solicitation, if one is released.
Purpose:

The FBI is releasing this RFC in order to:
1.	Inform industry (potential Offerors) about the FBI?s plans for acquisition and sustainment of the Next Generation Identification (NGI) system.
2.	Solicit recommendations from industry regarding how to best achieve the Bureau?s vision for the NGI.
3.	Solicit recommendations from industry for improving the draft RFP and the specifications in order to
?	Encourage competition,
?	Reduce program risk,
?	Reduce acquisition cost,
?	Reduce the total cost of ownership (Life Cycle Cost), 
?	Achieve higher levels of performance of the NGI.

Security Requirements:

The Government intends to secure services or equipment from firms where, in the opinion of the Government, foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI) does not adversely impact security requirements.  The Government reserves the right to contract with such Interested Parties under appropriate arrangements when it determines that such a contract will be in the best interest of the Government.  With the understanding that this RFC may result in a future RFP, Offerors are encouraged to voluntarily submit information requested on the Key Management Personnel List (KMPL) and the Section K ? Acquisition Risk Questions attached with this RFC in order to expedite the risk assessment requirement, which will be part of the RFP.  If an interested party submitted this information as part of the NGI RFI released in October 2006, the information does not need to be resubmitted as part of the RFC response unless the information has changed.


Reference Library:

<SUBJECT>G -- Employment Networks for the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFP-07-0010F
<CONTACT>Erica Day, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-965-9512, Fax 410-966-9310, Email erica.day@ssa.gov
<DESC>On December 17, 1999, the President signed legislation (P.L. 106-170) establishing the Ticket-to-Work and Self-Sufficiency Program.  Under the Program, the Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement to contract with vendors to become employment networks (ENs), with responsibility for the coordination and delivery of services necessary to prepare and place beneficiaries in employment.  The purpose of the Ticket Program is to provide disability beneficiaries more choices for receiving employment services and increase provider incentives to serve these individuals.  Under the program, SSA will provide disability beneficiaries with a Ticket they may use to obtain employment services, Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) services or other support services from an EN of their choice.  The Ticket-to-Work and Self-Sufficiency Program has been phased-in nationally (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) over a three-year period.  Implementation of the Ticket Program has been accomplished in phases.  Phase 1 began in 2001 and Tickets were distributed beginning in February 2002 in 13 States:  Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont, and Wisconsin.  Phase 2 began in 2002 and Tickets were distributed beginning in November 2002 in 20 States (and the District of Columbia):  Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi,  Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.  Phase 3 began in 2003 and Tickets were distributed beginning in November 2003 in 17 States (and U.S. territories and possessions):  Alabama, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  As SSA continues to release Tickets based on new accretions to the disability roles, this solicitation will remain open continuously until further notice.  Contractors serving as ENs will be responsible for an array of duties including, but not limited to: (1) providing appropriate employment services, VR services or other support services consistent with the successful attainment of a clients employment goal(s), either directly or by entering into contracts or agreements with other providers of such services; (2) providing the client with a comprehensive explanation of the service offered, as well as the ENs responsibilities to its clients; (3) developing jointly with the client an Individual Work Plan (IWP) that defines the clients employment goals(s) and outlines the services and supports necessary to achieve and maintain that goal; and (4) reporting data to SSA on specific client outcomes achieved through the provision of services, a statement of finances, and other management information data.  Offerors will be evaluated in accordance with the Statement of Work, and required documentation.  It is anticipated that each contract will be for a 5-year term, with one 5-year option period.  The Request for Proposal (RFP), SSA-RFP-07-0010F, will be available for downloading on February 28, 2007 from the Federal Procurement website at www.fedbizopps.gov and replaces all previously posted versions.  HARD COPIES WILL NOT BE MAILED.  IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS REQUIRED, PLEASE CONTACT THE EMPLOYMENT NETWORKS CONTRACT TEAM TOLL-FREE AT 1-866-584-5180; FOR THE HEARING-SPEECH IMPAIRED CALL 1-866-584-5181.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L LCMC)- Maneuver Ammo & Ground Systems Contracting Center at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 intends to procure on a Full and Open Competitive Basis the requirement for the manufacture and delivery of 5.56mm, M862 Short Range Training Ammunition (SRTA)Cartridges. The requirement will consist of one base year contract with four Option Years. The quantities will be determined based on the offerors offer. Different quantity ranges could be contemplated. This cartridge matches the trajectory of standard 5.56mm combat ammunition out to 25 Meters while having a maximum range of no greater than 250 Meters. This allows realistic training at sites where range restrictions prohibit the firing of standard 5.56mm ammunition. The M862 cartridge is used in the M16 family of weapons and requires the use of a modified weapon bolt, (the M2 training bolt) which converts the M16 from a gas-operated weapon to a blowback operation. The cartridge shall conform to the requirements of the M862 Performance Specification. If the cartridge design has previously been qualified by the government in accordance with the M862 performance specification, proof of qualification and any change to the original design that had been already approved by the Government shall be provided at time of proposal submission. Any change to a previously qualified design not reviewed and approved by the Government, will require the same testing and evaluation described in the solicitation for a non-qualified design. The design or any change to a qualified design must be qualified approximately within 120 days after contract award, specific time frame and other specific requirements will be provided at the solicitation. The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available for download approximately 2 April 2007 at http://procnet.pica.army.mil. Proposals will be required within thirty (30) days of the date of release of the RFP. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. Respondents must demonstrate a capability for high rate production and delivery of these cartridges. Any non-qualified sources or any unapproved change to an original qualified design, who would be interested in submitting a proposal, will be responsible to qualify their round at their own expense in order to be considered for award.

<DESC>The Government intends to award a Sole Source contract to Romanyk Consulting to integrate process engineering with IT systems at USAMRIID; and to ensure that the new Oracle-based IT tools deployed at USAMRIID are maximally utilized to support the re- engineered processes.    The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), located at Fort Detrick, Maryland, has a requirement for a support team on-site to continue its efforts in re-engineering internal processes.  USAMRIID's mission is to conduct basi c and applied medical research on infectious microbes of high consequence to the warfighter.  Its workforce is composed of approximately 800 personnel, which includes technical, infrastructure support, and administrative functions.   Internal processes per tain to business operations, such as personnel, finance, and logistics, as well as technical management of the research program and operation of core technical service centers. The institute retained a process engineering firm in 2004 to provide assistance in re-engineering USAMRIIDs internal processes.  The scope of work included adapting and integrating internal processes to maximally utilize the capabilities inherent in the i nstitutes recently-deployed Oracle Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Information Technology (IT) system, and to provide implementation support as these ERP systems were deployed.  To date, USAMRIID has successfully installed, configured, and moved into p roduction ERP modules based on Oracle Human Resources (HR), Self-Service Human Resources (SSHR), Labor Distribution (LD), Projects, and Oracle Collaboration Suite modules.   The institute also utilizes other IT sub-systems to support its operations that in terface with the core Oracle ERP system.   During the previous process engineering engagement, major emphasis was placed on integration of internal processes related to personnel, leveraging the capabilities of Oracle HR and related sub-systems, since it was the IT system that was deployed first.  Re-engineering support provided under the previous contract was highly successful, and resulted in substantial improvement in internal business processes related to personnel, including biosurety, safety, and security.   The purpose of the current performance-based requirement is to continue this effort, focusing on performing process re-engineering and integration functions primarily in other areas, leveraging the new IT tools available to the institute as much as possibl e.   The contractor is expected to coordinate closely with IT personnel involved in sustaining the existing USAMRIID IT systems to ensure that they are properly configured to integrate with the re-engineered processes.   Critical to the success of this pro posed engagement, the contractor will need a thorough understanding of the following:  1) USAMRIIDs internal processes, 2) capabilities of the IT systems deployed by USAMRIID, and 3) workflow optimization using Business Process Engineering Language (BPEL) .   Romanyk Consulting has been determined to be the only entity that can completely satisfy the requirements.  If no challenges to acquiring these services without competition are received by 6 Mar 07 12pm EST, the Government reserves the right to execute an award without publishing a solicitation.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The office of NOAA, Channel Island National Marine Sanctuary (CINMS) located in Santa Barbara, CA has a requirement for environmental sciences research support and administrative support.
In 2003 and 2007 a network of nearshore and offshore marine zones were created in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (CINMS) to protect biodiversity and habitats.  CINMS staff works in concert with the Dept. of Fish and Game staff, the Sanctuary Advisory Council and several academic and institutional partners to administer, anage, monitor, enforce and provide outreach on the marine zoning network.

CINMS has a critical need at this time to secure contract services to provide Spatial Science support necessary for the successful implementation, monitoring and management of the marine zones in CINMS.  Although the monitoring, enforcement and education and outreach planning documents have been drafted, they have yet to be fully translated into a robust program that is managed, funded and coordinated over the long-run in a comprehensive and predictable manner with all of the partners mentioned above.   

In addition, CINMS needs  Spatial Science support to meet National, Regional, and local spatial data analysis needs and requirements. The sanctuary program?s Information Management and Spatial Technology (IMaST) program is also evolving and requiring more dedicated staff time at field sites to meet national goals regarding information technology and data integration. Further, management and research goals of CINMS require an increase in staff time dedicated to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial database management.

In order to obtain information from FedTeDS, you will first be required to register with CCR. The Central Contractor Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity. Since October 1, 2003, it is federally mandated that any business wishing to do business with the federal government under a FAR-based contract must be registered in CCR before being awarded a contract. In addition, vendors must maintain their CCR records annually. You may access CCR at www.bpn.gov. Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS. No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites. You may access FedTeDS via the following URL https://www.FedTeDS.gov. You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled ?Register with FedTeDS? and then choosing the ?Vendor Registration Form? hyperlink. At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information: Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Company's , CCR Point of Contact )your Company's DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number),Your Telephone Number and Your E-Mail Address.

Also, Beginning January 1, 2005, as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) all vendors will be required to use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.   Potential offerors should refer to the solicitation package regarding instructions involving the use of ORCA.  

Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the Federal Business Opportunities website for amendments, if any, to the solicitation.  Offer due date and time for receipt of proposals will be set at the time the full solicitation is posted, but not less than 30 calendar days from such time.  All requests must be submitted to:

I.	Introduction
The Office of Workers? Compensation Programs (OWCP) under the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) administers disability compensation programs that mitigate the impact of work-related injury for certain workers and their families, through the provision of medical treatment and other benefits.
OWCP is seeking a centralized medical bill processing solution for three OWCP programs:  the Division of Federal Employees? Compensation (DFEC), the Division of Coal Mine Workers? Compensation (DCMWC) and the Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation (DEEOIC).  Each OWCP program has a unique set of processing rules based on legislatively-mandated requirements, and that the CBP solution must allow for all three processes based on these unique rules.  Specifically, payments are only authorized for the medical conditions accepted as being compensable by the OWCP program under which the claim is filed.
The primary goals of the OWCP CBP are to:
?	Ensure a smooth and timely transition from the incumbent service provider.
?	Ensure efficient, accurate and timely processing of bills for compensable medical conditions.
?	Ensure timely and correctly processed authorization for covered benefits.
?	Assure accurate and timely responses to customer inquiries and requests.
?	Incorporate state-of-the-art medical bill processes, including but not limited to, utilization reviews for medical treatments and prescriptions, and fraud and abuse protection programs.
?	Establish a framework for continuous improvement.

This notification is a Request for Information (RFI) from industry vendors regarding their interest, capabilities and recommendations in developing proposals for OWCP?s Central Bill Process.  This RFI is intended to identify potential vendors and to solicit information useful for guidance and preparation of an RFP.
II.	Background
OWCP seeks a contractor to perform medical bill processing operations for the three OWCP programs, to limit payment based on the medical condition being accepted as compensable by the program, to support the prior authorization of services and to respond to inquiries related to medical services from claimants and providers.    
CBP operations process medical bills, manage provider enrollment, support the prior authorization of services, and respond to inquiries related to medical services from claimants and providers.  In contrast with typical medical bill processing operations, payments are authorized based on the medical conditions (ICD-9 codes) accepted as being compensable by the OWCP program under which the claim is filed.  This is accomplished by applying OWCP?s treatment suites framework to the accepted condition.
In addition to processing bills, the selected contractor shall be responsible for all inquiries regarding bills and appeals, authorization of services, suspense resolution, provider enrollment and appeals processing.  As the contractor is not a fiscal agent, it will send payment files to the Treasury Department for disbursement of checks (the contractor does not disburse payment).  The selected contractor shall interface with the OWCP National Office and District Offices? staff for each program in the performance of these activities.
OWCP?s medical bill processing function is currently being provided as an outsourced service by an incumbent contractor.  As the incumbent is providing an outsourced service, the government does not own an information system that will be transferred to a follow-on contractor.
The estimated annual volumes of bills, authorizations, and inquiries, processed and the providers enrolled for each program are presented below.
   	
 	DFEC;	DCMWC;	DEEOIC;	TOTAL
Line items processed	10,929,598;	495,350;	300,266;	11,725,214
Call center calls processed*	917,794;	42,028;	30,057;	989,879
Authorizations processed	557,758; 	958;	1,714;	560,430
Bill preparation	     4,834,905; 	226,119;	85,612;	5,146,636
Pages imaged	6,557,890;	622,792; 303,490; 7,484,172;
New provider enrollment	 7,270;	1,334;	1,042;	9,646;
* Based on an average call of 4.5 minutes

In 2006, there were approximately 758,291 authenticated hits against the current CBP web portal by claimants, providers and OWCP employees.
Approximately 1,745 internal OWCP users, representing all 3 OWCP Programs, require read only access to the processing system.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Ithaca iTherm 280 Thermal Receipt Printer.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the Ithaca iTherm 280 Thermal Receipt Printer and Paper as key components for overseas Consular windows.  The Ithaca iTherm 280 Thermal Receipt Printer is a receipt printer for deployment with the Automatic Cash Register System (ACRS).  The Ithaca iTherm 280 Thermal Receipt Printer is a wireless thermal printer that prints 8 inches (203 millimeters) per second.  Thermal printers, which heat the wax of a single-use ribbon to transfer a one- or two-color image to paper, are generally faster and more versatile than the dot matrix printers.  The Ithaca iTherm printers are used for point-of-sales receipts that may contain bar codes and images as well as alphanumeric characters. The Ithaca iTherm 280 printer meets CAs need by meeting the following required specifications: 	Print Speed: Up to 203 mm/sec.  (8 in. per second)  	Print Resolution: 8 Dots per mm (203 dpi) Horizontal and Vertical  	Auto-Cutter: Partial Cut  	Metal tear off  	Simple Drop-in Loading of Receipt Paper  	Cash Drawer Drivers: Dual with Status (RJ12)  	Print Zone Width: 72 mm (2.83 in.)  	APA Bit Map Graphics  	67 Language Code Pages  	Data Buffer8K (adjustable)  	Up to 1MB RAM for a User-defined Character Set or Bit-image 	8MB Non-volatile Flash Buffer for Multiple Character Set, Bit-images and Electronic Journal  	Unicode Support via Downloadable Font (Download Utility Available)  	Page Mode Capability  	Self Diagnostics  	Bar CodesCode 39, Code 93, Interleaved 2 of 5, UPC-A and UPC-E, Codabar, EAN8 and EAN13, Code 128, PDF417  	Buzzer under application control  	Paper Out Indicator<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The Ithaca iTherm 280 Thermal Receipt Printer have been found by CAs Systems Engineering as the only a suitable receipt printer for deployment with the Automatic Cash Register System (ACRS).  The team reviewed thermal printers, which heat the wax of a single-use ribbon to transfer a one- or two-color image to paper. These printers are generally faster and more versatile than the previously deployed dot matrix printers.  The printers are used for point-of-sales receipts that may contain bar codes and images as well as alphanumeric characters.  The Ithaca iTherm 280 Thermal Receipt Printer meets the following requirements: 	Compatibility with the current version of ACRS  	Ability to print receipts 	Available in 110V and 220V or auto-sense 	Speed (faster than previously deployed printers) 	Low noise level (quieter than previously deployed printers) 	No need for 3-ply printing, but the system still needs to print 2 receipts The Ithaca iTherm 280 Thermal Receipt Printer has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP MSA30 External Disk Drives.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/VCSs Data Engineering (DEG) team requires that Oracle application servers (POS) configured with a Stand-by Oracle Server (SOS) have an external disk drive for the purpose of coping redo logs to the SOS in the event that the POS crashes. During the activation of the new IVIS servers on November 9, 2006, the external disk drive from the existing IVIS server, a Dell PowerEdge 4600 was installed to the new HP ML570 server.  The initial attempt caused the IVIS POS to crash. The IVIS database was corrupted and necessitated the activation of the IVIS SOS server and a rebuild of IVIS POS server.  DEG has the following concerns about using the external drive from the old Dell server 1)     Questions of compatibility a.     Servers and external devices that are a few years apart and are from different manufacturers cause an issue of compatibility 2)    The external drive has a rating of 10k rpm, while the internal drives on the HP ML570 have a rating of 15k rpm. a.     Since redo logs are duplexed onto the external drive, all writes to all drives will slow down to the slowest drive speed As an added benefit of adding the disk array we would be able to add additional disk drives to the IVIS servers. This will result in  1)    Redundancy a.     A hot spare disk drive would be added to each RAID drive.  2)    Increased drive capacity. a.     Disk capacity of all raided data drives will be doubled. 3)     Spreading the database across additional drives will increase overall server performance<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. CA/CST/VCS owns and has in use HP servers, which do not have external disk drives.  During activation of the HP servers, a Dell external drive was connected resulting in a crash and the corruption of the database.  There are concerns of using these same Dell external drives, or any other manufacturers external disk drive, due to questions of compatibility.  Other compatibility issues include fact that the external drive has a rating of 10k rpm, while the internal drives on the HP ML570 have a rating of 15k rpm.  Since redo logs are duplexed onto the external drive, all writes to all drives will slow down to the slowest drive speed.   The HP disk array is the only alterative that will meet the needs of CA/CST/VCS.  It will be outfitted with twelve 146GB drives each.  In addition, the disk array connected to the server will have a thirteenth drive.  These drives will replace the external disk drives used to store the redo logs in case of a system crash.  The additional twelve drives will be divided between the current RAID 5 drives configured on the servers.  Besides increasing disk space it will also improve the performance of the servers by spreading the database across additional spindles.<BR><BR>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION.
The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircraft Support Contracts Department, Code 2.5.1.3 at Patuxent River, MD has a requirement for WARFIGHTING ANALYSIS, ENGINEERING & TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES for the Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division, Warfare Analysis and Integration Department (AIR 4.10).  This is a sources sought for small business only; large business need not respond.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a notification to industry of the impending Government solicitation for analytic services and a market research tool being used to determine the ability of small business to meet the requirements outlined below prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of the Request For Proposal (RFP).  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.

BACKGROUND.
Key to the development of the Navys investment strategies to obtain the Navys vision for future operations is assessment of the Naval force structure and the role of Naval Forces in supporting Joint warfighting capability requirements.  New warfighting concerns and threats to our National Security require reshaping our Naval force structure to secure the warfighting capabilities and capacity needed to address current and future threats.  An increased focus on Low Contingency Operations (LCOs), formerly known as the Global War on Terrorism, requires and increase in forward deployed forces-capable of providing a scalable and rapid response- and a significant change in our Nations Naval force structure and the way we train and deploy troops to meet emerging threats.  

The NAVAIR Warfare Analysis and Integration Department (AIR 4.10) serves as the authoritative source for Naval aviation warfare analysis and provides the analytic underpinning to support Naval aviation investment decisions.  Using campaign and mission level models as a foundation, AIR 4.10 assesses existing, developmental, and conceptual weapon systems and tactics in the context of Major Combat Operations (MCOs) and within various operational and tactical situations against defined threats to determine warfighting gaps.  Warfighting gaps are further assessed to identify the optimal Naval warfighting capability and capacity that is required to achieve the what it takes to win criteria established for a given MCO.     

Fundamental to AIR 4.10s capability in providing credible Naval aviation warfare assessments is the Naval Aviation Enterprise Warfare Analysis Environment (NAE WAE).  The goals for implementing the NAE WAE are to improve Modeling and Simulation (M&S) analysis tools used for requirements determination and evaluation; ensure models and tools ultimately represent Naval aviation capabilities in the Joint environment; leverage on-going Joint and Service modeling efforts; develop the capability to model emerging security challenges and new operational concepts; advance state of the art in M&S technology; and ensure M&S is applied with engineering discipline with improved traceability of data through the modeling hierarchy.


REQUIREMENTS.
The contractor shall be required to provide a broad spectrum of support to Naval and Joint warfighting capability assessments and M&S within each Naval Capability Pillar -Sea Strike, Sea Shield, Sea Basing, FORCEnet and Sea Shaping - to supplement and enhance government and military warfighting analytic efforts being conducted in support of AIR 4.10, the Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) and the Office of Naval Operations (OPNAV).  The scope of the effort is multi-faceted and includes warfare analysis, M&S, software development, and programmatic support.

Warfare Analysis:

-  The contractor shall support development of common assumptions and data used for analyses in various warfare areas, including scenarios, operational concepts and tactics, platforms, and systems.  The contractor shall perform warfare analyses and assessments in terms of both cost and capability to determine the capability of existing and planned weapons systems to meet current and emerging warfighting requirements.  
-  The contractor shall perform alternative force structure analyses to determine the Navy?s capability to meet peacetime deployment requirements and respond to transition-to-war and contingency operations.  Force Structure Assessments include required tasks to support all aspects of Operations Analysis (OA) and Operations Research (OR).  
-  The contractor shall support Joint Capabilities Integration & Development System (JCIDS) analysis for Joint Capability Areas as required.  The contractor shall perform Functional Area Analyses, Functional Needs Analyses, Functional Solutions Analyses, and Post Independent Analyses.

-  The contractor shall support significant engagement, mission, and campaign level M&S efforts under the NAE WAE.  
-  The contractor shall assist AIR 4.10 in establishing disciplined engineering processes and standards to ensure analyses are traceable to JCIDS requirements and aligned with architectures, both operational and technical, within the Department of Defense (DoD) Architecture Framework (DODAF).   
-  The contractor shall support the development of new discovery type modeling efforts.  Efforts will include the development of M&S tools that support Joint and Navy resource allocation decisions including development of discovery models for non-traditional warfare, Manpower Personnel Training & Education (MPT&E), and emerging Joint and Naval mission warfare areas.  
-  The contractor shall develop and use M&S and analysis techniques to assess physical phenomenon, engineering designs and approaches, concepts and alternatives, weapons and their characteristics, and platforms and their performance for both Blue (friendly), Red (threat), White (neutral), and Green (coalition) systems.  
Software Development: 
- The contractor shall perform software development efforts to evaluate, modify, or enhance M&S applications.
-  The contractor shall perform M&S software testing and implementation efforts, as applicable to modified or enhanced M&S applications.
-  The contractor shall develop and implement Modeling and Simulation Support Plans (MSSPs).
- The contractor shall develop and implement rigorous software development best practices for MS&A.
- The contractor shall perform Verification & Validation (V&V) of M&S and data.

<DESC>This sources sought notice is issued for market research purposes only; no solicitation is being issued at this time.  The 50th Contracting Squadron is contemplating combining the two requirements contained in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS) extracts into one Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract.  The 4th Space Operations Squadron (4 SOPS) Software Configuration Control PWS extract is for software configuration control with emphasis on operational Milstar and Advanced Extremely High Frequency/Advanced Satellite Mission Control Subsystem (AEHF/ASMCS) software and databases and operational applications developed to support 4 SOPS operations and maintenance requirements.  The secondary purpose is to provide project management support to coordinate and accommodate restructuring activities within 4 SOPS.  The AFSCN Communications Configuration Management System (CCMS) PWS extract is for operations and maintenance of the CCMS tool which depicts AFSCN communications connectivity and the associated equipment.  CCMS content includes AFSCN Common User Element (CUE) Communications Segment, Network Management Segment circuit connectivity subsystems, and Electronic Schedule Dissemination (ESD) subsystem connectivity.

In order to determine technical capabilities for the 4 SOPS software configuration requirement, please provide answers to the following questions:

1. Does the Contractor have sufficient knowledge of and experience with the entire Milstar configuration control infrastructure, to include Satellite Mission Control Subsystem (SMCS), Command and Control System-Consolidated (CCS-C), ASMCS and the follow-on AEHF satellites to function as a subject matter expert?

2. Does the Contractor have sufficient knowledge of and experience with facilities at Schriever AFB to adequately support the preparation and implementation of the new operations infrastructure to support ASMCS and AEHF as well as maintaining current facilities?

3. Does the contractor have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the backward-compatibility process in place to ensure an efficient and seamless transition from Milstar-only to a combined Milstar & AEHF constellation?

In order to determine technical capabilities for the AFSCN CCMS requirement, please provide answers to the following questions:

1. Does the Contractor have sufficient knowledge of and experience with the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) Communications Segment to function as a subject matter expert?

2. Does the contractor have sufficient knowledge of and experience with the government-provided software applications (identified in the PWS) which are dedicated to supporting the system operations, maintenance and development, in order to provide on-line Website visualization (drawings/diagrams) representing the data maintained in the CCMS databases?

3.  Does the contractor have experience in web-based system sustainment and management to include the following:  a) the ability to develop an on-line user feedback capability; b) a statistics gathering capability that can automatically capture the systems user access information and use the information to produce metrics that depict actual time usage of the system; and c) the ability to ensure the on-line system is secure from intrusion and unauthorized modifications?

All businesses capable of providing the services in one or both of the PWSs are invited to respond.  Please provide enough information when responding to the questions that the Government can make a determination of the Contractor?s ability to perform the requirement; however, please limit your responses to one single-sided page per question. Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought notice is voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this sources sought notice.  If interested in responding to this notice, the Government requests interested parties submit a brief description of their company?s business size, business status, anticipated teaming arrangements, a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers, and whether or not the Contractor has an active GSA schedule.  All submissions shall be provided electronically via e-mail to stacy.reed@schriever.af.mil or chad.bowman@schriever.af.mil.

<DESC>The US Postal Service is requesting proposals from companies that have proven capabilities to provide approaches to automate the movement of letter mail from input systems to final sorting systems. The input systems are primarily the Advanced Facer Canceller System (AFCS), but are not limited to the AFCS. The output systems are the Delivery Bar Code Sorters (DBCS). The AFCS separates mail into three categories, FIM (remittance) mail, local mail, and outgoing mail. Typically, each category of mail from the AFCS is sorted on a different DBCS. That is, there is one DBCS that sorts FIM mail; there is a second DBCS that sorts the local mail; and there is a third DBCS that sorts outgoing mail. 

Those companies with demonstrated technology that may be in use in the general public or for other postal administrations are asked to propose an approach that can accept as input the mail from multiple (at least 4) input systems and to distribute that mail to multiple (at least 3) output systems. The mail is to be distributed to the output systems based on delivery destination of the mail and the sort plans loaded on the output systems. Proposals will be evaluated on total cost to implement, functional risk, and performance risk. A single proposal will be selected for a field proof of concept evaluation of an engineering prototype system. The US Postal Service will provide funding for the field evaluation but not for the development of the engineering prototype.

<DESC>Request for Information				February 28, 2007

1.0 Introduction

The ATF is exploring the viability of a single-source supplier for leasing cars in support of various law enforcement task forces across the country.  This Request for Information (RFI) will enable the ATF to assess the interest, experiences, capabilities, and strategies of various companies available to support this national program.  

Interested parties are asked to provide information as outlined in the sections below.  We request a response to each section so that we can fully assess the viability of both our strategy and your potential participation.  In addition to the items listed below, you are encouraged to identify any questions or areas of concern you believe could influence the success of our strategy and/or your interest and ability to participate.

Responses should be submitted no later than the close of business Wednesday March 18th, 2007.  Please send them via email to the attention of Brian Wilkins at Brian.wilkins@atf.gov.

2.0 Fleet Size and Location

2.1 Size.  The fleet we wish to include in the program contains approximately 1,500 vehicles, with anywhere from 1 to 150 vehicles in a particular location.  Growth projections suggest that a fleet size of 1,500 vehicles is possible within the next two to three years.  Please comment on your organization?s ability to support a fleet of this size.

2.2 Locations.  Our task forces are geographically located throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.  There are over 200 different locations involved, but the main cities are those in which one of the ATF's 23 field Divisions is located.  Please comment on your organization?s ability to serve a national fleet.  Are there specific locations (cities, states, regions) that may be an issue for your company to serve?










3.0 Vehicle Specifications and Operational Requirements

3.1 Vehicle Types.  The ATF is interested in leasing GSA Class III mid-size sedans (e.g. Ford Taurus, Chevrolet Impala) and GSA Class 105A 4x4 sport utility vehicles (e.g. Chevrolet Trailblazer, Ford Explorer).  Please comment on your organization's ability to provide vehicles meeting these classifications.

3.2 Vehicle Characteristics.  Due to the potentially sensitive nature of the use of these vehicles, there are specific vehicle options that should be either included or omitted.  For example, factory-installed window tinting is desired.  Certain flashy or fad colors should be avoided (white, fire-engine red, purple, etc).  Any on-board telematics options, such as On-Star, should be either disabled or removed.  Please comment on your organization's ability to provide vehicles that meet these characteristics.

3.3 Mileage Trade-ins.  While the ATF sees a wide range of usage levels for its task force vehicles, we have estimated that the average annual mileage will be 15,000 miles per year.  Given the ATF's desire to operate newer, low-mileage vehicles for both operational purposes and reduced maintenance requirements, please discuss your organization's strategies for handling trade-ins.  Does your organization have any desired practices or limitations on the timing or mileage necessary for trading in vehicles?

3.4 Trade-ins Due to Compromised Identity.  While not a common occurrence, there will be times when particular vehicles will no longer be usable due to compromised identity (we estimate less than 2% of the fleet annually).  Please discuss your organization's ability to support these types of trade-ins, including the notice required and the estimated turnaround time for a replacement.

3.5  Service and Maintenance.  The ATF is willing to consider including service and maintenance of its leased vehicles in this contract.  Please comment on your organization's ability to provide service and maintenance.  What are your options for providing oil changes, tire repair/replacement, windshield repairs, etc?

3.6 Wear and Tear.  The ATF considers minor dings and scratches part of the normal wear and tear on a vehicle.  Please comment on your organization's policies regarding wear and tear.  What do you consider excessive and how do you propose that it is handled?

3.7 Accidents.  The ATF understands it is responsible for the cost of repairing damages due to accidents.  As a government agency, the ATF is self-insured and will not be carrying an independent insurance policy.  Please comment on your organizations policies and procedures for handling accidents with its leased vehicles.

4.0 Business Process / Contract Details

4.1 Organizational Structure. The ATF's goal is to institute a nationally managed contract, with a single point-of-contact to check availability, schedule deliveries, and manage a consolidated billing arrangement.  Please comment on your organization's ability to provide this service, along with any suggestions or alternatives you would recommend.

4.2 Contract Term.  It is the ATF's intent to agree to a 12-month contract with four 12-month options, for a total contract length of 60 months.  Please comment on your organization?s interest in, and ability to support, a contract term of this length.

4.3 Rate Structure. The ATF's goal is to agree on a flat rate for each car or SUV (two prices in all), independent of the vehicle's location.  Please comment on your organization's ability to provide this type of flat rate structure. Understanding the usage patterns estimated in section 3.3 above, discuss your organization?s options for handling mileage (unlimited versus per-mile charges).

4.4 Payment Terms and Discounts.  The ATF normally pays in arrears 30 days after receipt of an invoice.  However, we will consider the financial attractiveness of other terms, including lump-sum up-front payment for a 12-month period.  Please comment on various payment term options your organization would suggest for this type of contract. 

4.5 Confidentiality.  Because some of these vehicles may be used in an undercover or law enforcement sensitive nature, leasing companies must keep the ATF's involvement as confidential as possible.  Any outside inquiry must lead to a covert company and address.  Ideally, the ATF's involvement would not be known at the vehicle's point of delivery.  Please comment on your organization's ability to address the ATF's concerns with confidentiality.  Are there specific actions that you would suggest?

4.6 Implementation Timeline.  The ATF would like to select a vendor and begin leasing vehicles within a relatively short period of time.  A gradual staging over several months will be necessary to phase out existing leases and implement a nation-wide roll-out.  However, our expectation is to begin delivering vehicles to the field no later than June 1st, 2007.  Please comment on the amount of notice your company would require to begin providing vehicles, as well as any limits you would have on the timing to phase in all 1,500+ vehicles.  Be sure to include an estimate for administrative effort to get the program started.

<DESC>The Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest has an occasional need for tree planting in the Carson Ranger district.  We are trying to locate potential vendors for short notice, small (under $25,000), projects.  Due to the low dollar value, and necessary flexability in time schedules, these vendors should most likely be located within reasonable proximity of Carson City, NV.  These vendors would receive requests for quotations by FAX or E-mail.  They would generally have approximately a week to respond to the RFQ, and once awarded, would need to mobilize very quickly after award to get the planting done by coordinating with the Carson Ranger District personnel.  We need to develop this list quickly as there is a current need for vendors.  Those who respond by Monday, March 5th will receive a current RFQ which will need response no later than Friday, March 9th Interested vendors should contact Charlene Byrd or Steve Roehr as shown in this notice.  To receive RFQ's we will need a Company Name, Point of Contact, Phone Number, FAX Number, and very important:  An E-MAIL ADDRESS for receipt of Requests for Quotations.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION : 

The US POSTAL SERVICE is currently seeking information on available technology and supply sources in the area of mail processing equipment that can provide products that function to the general specifications described in this notice.  The US POSTAL SERVICE is seeking to deploy an equipment - Postage Due Automation (PDA), that will automate the manual weighing, counting and reporting of various types of postage due mail.  Automating the manual and very labor intensive postage due mail operation shall result in work hour savings nationwide.  


The intent of this notice is to gather product information from current technology sources that can meet the requirements specified herein.  This is a request for information only and is not a solicitation to purchase equipment or services.  Information gathered through this announcement may be used to pre-qualify suppliers for a potential competitive product evaluation at the US POSTAL SERVICE and an opportunity to submit a proposal for this solution.


The system description with performance data submission is to be provided to Mr. Tom Raspet, Contracting Officer, Automation CMC, 8403 Lee Highway, Merrifield, VA, 22082-8150, Telephone (703) 280-7803 thomas.m.raspet@usps.gov    Requirements Specification Postage Due Automation (PDA) Program.

BACKGROUND :


Many business mailers subscribe to the Postal Service Business Reply Mail (BRM) service, wherein postage due mail in the form of BRM letters and flats are sent back by responding individuals to the BRM subscriber. Sometimes, the weight of the BRM mail piece varies, requiring distribution clerks in Post Offices nationwide to manually weigh and separate each mail piece into weight categories. Each weight category is then manually counted and recorded to determine the correct postage due for that type of mail. That postage due is charged to the business mailer account subscribing to the BRM service.  


Another scenario in processing BRM is when the mail pieces weigh the same.  In this case, the activities of the distribution clerk are limited to manually counting each mail piece and calculating the postage due on the total piece count for that mail type.
  

The Postal Service is looking for an automated process that will eliminate and/or reduce the time associated with the individual manual weighing, counting and reporting of mail pieces for postage due mail and any other type of mail that may fit similar processing requirements (e.g. address correction).
 

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS : 


An acceptable PDA system shall be a simple, one operator, single-pass, and small footprint machine that performs many functions (including weighing, counting, reporting and data archiving), and is able to process mail up to 3/8 inch or better in thickness and up to 13 ounces or better in weight. The spaces available at Post Offices for the PDA system is 84 inches long, 24 inches high and 36 inches deep; the system shall be able rest and operate on top of regularly built table(s) of those dimensions.
   

The system shall be self feeding, rather than having an operator feed one piece at a time. Its in line scale shall be capable of operating in at least 3 modes: a) weigh and count all mail pieces as they move across the scale; b) weigh only the first piece and count subsequent pieces that weigh the same; and c) only count mail pieces without weighing.  The system shall be able to visually tag counted mail in order to identify non-counted mail to the operator. The system shall have a minimum throughput of 100 pieces per minute.  Jam rate should be less than 0.5%.


The system shall be configurable allowing data inputs of the following: rates for each mail type and customer account profile (up to 50 accounts).  The system shall be able to send data to a report module, processed pieces and postage due amounts, by each customer account, by mail type, by weight, and by rate category.  The system shall have data security features categorizing user access.  The system shall be able to store data for at least 90 days.  The system shall have flexible features to allow future capabilities to transmit data to other systems as well as interface with other systems.


SCHEDULE & DELIVERABLES : 


For purposes of this technology assessment and market survey, potential vendors shall provide PDA system descriptions with performance data for US POSTAL SERVICE review. This information shall include a complete description of a working unit which substantiates the vendor's ability to meet the technical requirements.  This written information shall be delivered to Mr. Tom Raspet (address noted above) no later than March 30, 2007.  Minor variations to the values expressed within the above technical requirements will be considered by the US POSTAL SERVICE if such systems are currently in use in other postal administrations or market applications.  A question and answer (Q&A) period is designated between March 12 through March 23, 2007.  All supplier questions must be received by March 16, 2007.  The Postal Service will provide official responses by March 23, 2007.


US POSTAL SERVICE prefers to deal with companies that have existing equipment which is available for demonstration and testing purposes.


Following US POSTAL SERVICE review of the submitted PDA system descriptions with performance data, a pre-qualification determination will be made and if appropriate, competitive evaluation testing plans will be furnished.  The pre-qualified suppliers will be firms whose record of performance in the market place has demonstrated their ability to perform to consistently high standards.
  

The US POSTAL SERVICE will not provide funding for development activities associated with meeting the specified requirements.  Interested parties shall submit a total of five copies (three hard copy and two soft data copy) of any company promotional handouts, brochures, catalogs, technology performance specifications, and operations manuals of equipment that meet or exceed these specifications and requirements to the address provided in this announcement.  Overly elaborate responses are neither expected nor required.  The US POSTAL SERVICE by issuance of this notice makes no commitment to the acquisition of any PDA system technology.

<DESC>This is a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information. All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI.   This synopsis is for planning purposes only and neither constitutes a RFP, nor do es it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the U.S. Army Resea rch Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) Acquisition Center, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD to determine potential sources capable of providing soldiers alternative commercially available tactical headsets that include integral hearing protection. for  Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier.   The Ear Protection and Hearing Enhancement Tactical Headsets project within the Soldier Enhancement Program (SEP) defines explicit technical requirements for performance and interfaces.  It evaluates currently available products and then publishes results in the Qualified Products Database (QPD), which is a formal DoD Standardization Document.  This QPD permits acquisition programs and users to select from a list of Army-approved tactical headsets that have been verified for functionality, ruggedness and in terface compatibility with a multiple types of Army communications equipment. The overall concept for this effort is that industry will be invited to provide sample headsets for evaluation initially at no cost to the Government.  The objective of industry will be to be listed on the QPD as a Government approved headset.  Our testing  will narrow the candidates down as the testing proceeds, and the final phase of testing will employ soldier evaluations in the field.  A limited number of headsets which meet all test criteria may be purchased for this final evaluation by soldiers. When Army acquisition programs need a headset or Army units need this capability, each must assess, validate and chose from the variety of headsets on the market before proceeding.  This project will verify performance and interfaces beforehand, list appro ved products in the DoD Qualified Products database to streamline their selection process.  Note that this program is oriented directly to soldiers and not to specific platforms such as vehicles and aircraft. Potential sources should include their size sta tus for NAICS code 334290.  Testing will proceed through easily verified technical requirements that will help narrow the candidates.  The project will perform further testing in areas such as ruggedness, environmental compatibility and electromagnetic interference.  Headsets that ar e successful in this phase will then be field tested to obtain actual user inputs on suitability. The final phase of this project documents the headsets that meet technical requirements and suitability in the QPD and assigns national stock numbers to each headset.  The QPD will include headsets that conform to specific interfaces on the variety of radi o and intercom systems that soldiers use.  In addition, we envision separate class and type designations that describe form factor, and operating environment (such as dismounted infantry extremely ruggedized or nominal military use in more benign environme nts). A formal contracting process is part of this effort. To meet this requirement RDECOM Acquisition Center will issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). The BAA will consist of the following three (3) phases: Phase 1  Quad Chart The first step will be the submission of a one page Quad Chart that describes the hearing protection headset and a minimum of two or more headset samples for technical analysis. They will be required for a period of approximately four (4) months.  Environm ental and ruggedness testing may result in damage to the sample equipment.    NOTE: Over-the-ear and earplug headsets will be considered for evaluation provided they meet the following criteria:   1) Non-developmental items are required. 2) Test data that describes the hearing protection performance must be available and releasable to the Government. 3) Form factors shall be over-the-ear or in-ear systems with microphone. 4) No bone conduction microphone or speakers are part of the project. Phase 2  White Paper Offerors whose Quad Chart meets the essential criteria will be invited to submit a white paper that must contain as a minimum: product name, product description, a summary of the types of test data available, product unit cost, compatible military communic ations interfaces, Company Address, Technical and Contracting Points of Contact, Phone, Fax & Email.   Phase 3  Request for Proposals Offerors that submit white papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the Government will be invited to submit a formal proposal. These headsets will be evaluated as part of a standardization process to develop a list of qualified products for use by ground soldiers.  Future procurements by Government organizations may be awarded based on successful qualification. Questions and/or comments should be submitted to the following e-mail address:     TYRONE.M.KNIGHT@US.ARMY.MIL. An answer will be provided by return e-mail and all questions and answers will be posted on the FedBizOpps site. It is the responsibility of ind ustry to monitor www.fedbizopps.gov for the release of any follow-on information.      Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought Synopsis.

The major facilities in the area includes:  MacDill AFB, FL, Eglin AFB,  FL, Keesler AFB, MS, Fort Benning, GA, Fort Gordon, GA, Fort Stewart, GA, Fort Jackson, SC, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, FL, Naval Hospital Beaufort, SC, and Naval Hospital Pensacola, FL.          This procurement is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor Program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, (DSCP) Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) with the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) AND A separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to dis tribute their items.  This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is NOT a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime Vendor program please access the web site at: https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.       The TRBO will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement with incentive pricing will be based on a committed volume for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from the date of award with th ree (3) - 12 month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Anticipated award date is September 2007.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The award will be determined utilizing Best Value/trade off criteria.        Point of Contact is Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.   B.	Products & Performance Required    The Southeast Region is seeking product lines in the category of Surgical Sponges.     The estimated total volume for Surgical Sponges is $36,831.49.  This is based on the historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period.      At the request of the Southeast Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemizat ion of the brand, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Offerors    If your are interested in participating in this standardization, you must provide all detailed information on Surgical Sponges, which clearly outline the requirements stated within this notice along with a copy of your published literature to support al l responses by 4:00 P.M. EST on the date listed for closing on the FBO announcement.  All interested offerors are to provide electronically responses by email.  Send all corresponding information along with the following: Company name, point of contact, ad dress, phone number, fax, email address, Solicitation Number, Complete answers, and electronic set of published literature for Surgical Sponges, to Ginny Slayton, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil. (706) 787-2019 prior to the closing date of this solicitation i n order to remain competitive.      This process will include vendor(s) requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of best price offers. D.  Evaluation Criteria    The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from nine Military Treatment facilities in the Southeast Region.  They are the final decision makers for this initiative.      During Phase I, vendor(s) will be required to provide responses to the technical criteria/company criteria.  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will review the responses and determine acceptabilit y.  After review of technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.       The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will request product samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Vendor(s) are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendors will be given 1 0 business days from the issue of the notice to ship samples.        The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert like one to five rating scale.  One is equal to not acceptable and five is equal to highly acceptable.  With the exception of one question, all questions will be weighted equally.   Question number 2 Surgical Sponges absorbs fluid adequately will receive a double weight as the ability to fully absorb fluid and potential for inadequacy (i.e., thinness) of sponges is critical.  The CPT has set a 3.0 acceptability threshold for all p roduct groups.  Clinical/performance results lower than a 3.0 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.      After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.0 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of  the MTFs in the Southeast Region.      Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  Pricing will be evaluated based on the best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exc eed 5 years). 1.	Technical Criteria Evaluation The Clinical Product team will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability: a.	Vendor(s) must provide DAPA number for this Surgical Sponges.  b.	Vendor(s) must have separate agreement with Owens & Minor for distribution in the Southeast region.  Provide prime vendor conversion number.  c.	Vendor(s) must provide and attach a copy of all itemized brand(s) and styles that are manufactured and/or distributed for Surgical Sponges.      d.	Vendor(s) will list the industry production and safety standards used in manufacturing this product.  Provide the information on production standards.   e.	Vendor(s) must identify if company has had history of back orders and/or recalls for the product line. Explaining the a) dates and duration b) cause, c) resolution. f.	Vendor(s) will attach and provide company return goods policy & all warranties. g.	What types of educational tools or materials do you have for this product line? h.	What kind of staff training does your company provide? i.	Does your company provide 24/7 customer service? j.	Vendor(s) must be able to provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and competitive product cross reference in electronic excel format upon request.   k.	Are your products latex free?  Provide and attach a copy of all latex free items.   l.	Does your company manufacture and/or distribute a complete line of Surgical Sponges to include but not limited to: all sizes of sterile and non-sterile, multi-PLY, stick or tonsil sponges, kitners, cottonoids, and with & without radiopaque elements. 2.	Clinical Criteria Evaluation       A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the p roducts based upon the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.   i)	 Radiopaque element is adequate and easy to identify. ii)	Surgical Sponges absorbs fluid adequately. iii)	Surgical Sponges contains no lint.  iv)	Surgical Sponges are durable and remains intact during case. v)	Surgical Sponge package is easy to open and allows for aseptic delivery to sterile field. vi)	Expiration date is easily identified.     3.  Price Evaluation                   										                           	Technical/company and Clinical/performance factors will be evaluated first.  The technical/company and clinical/performance evaluation will determine who the acceptable offerors  are. Then the quotes will be compared regarding incentive price and the TPRB will perform a technical/price trade off (i.e., very superior technical capabilities may justify paying a higher price).

The agreement with incentive pricing will be based on a committed volume for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from the date of award with  three (3) - 12 month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Anticipated award date is August 2007.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The award will be determined utilizing Best Value/trade off criteria.        Point of Contact is Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.   B.	Products & Performance Required      The Southeast Region is seeking product lines in the category of Safety Scalpels and Blades.       The estimated total volume for non-safety Scalpels & Blades is $47,946.78.  The estimated total volume for Safety Scalpels & Blades is $8,398.07.  This is based on the historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period.  The regions goal is to conve rt all non-safety items to safety.     At the request of the Southeast Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemizat ion of the brand, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Offerors    If you are interested in participating in this standardization, you must provide all detailed information on the Safety Scalpels and Blades, which clearly outline the requirements stated within this notice along with a copy of your published literature to support all responses by the close of business on the closing date of this solicitation.  All interested offerors are to provide electronically responses by email.  Send all corresponding information along with the following: Company name, point of cont act, address, phone number, fax, email address, Solicitation Number, Complete answers, and electronic set of published literature for Safety Scalpels and Blades, to Ginny Slayton, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil. (706) 787-2019 prior to the closing date of th is solicitation in order to remain competitive.      This process will include vendor(s) requirements of electronic respo nses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic & paper copies of best price offers. D.  Evaluation Criteria      The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from nine Military Treatment facilities in the Southeast region.  They are the final decision makers fo r this initiative.      During Phase I, vendor(s) will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria.  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will review the responses and determine acceptability.  After  review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.      The Tri-Service Regional business Office (TRBO) will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs).  Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  A ten-business day period  will be allotted to vendors for shipment.  Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.       The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert like one to five rating scale.  One is equal to not acceptable and five is equal to highly acceptable.  All criteria are weighted equally.  The CPT has set a 3.5 acceptability thr eshold for all product groups.  Clinical/performance results lower than 3.5 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.      After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.5 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of  the MTFs in the Southeast Region.      Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  Pricing will be evaluated based on the best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exc eed 5 years).        1.  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation      The CPT will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability: i)	Vendor(s) must provide DAPA number for this product line.   ii)	Vendor(s) must have separate agreement with Owens & Minor for distribution in the Southeast region.  Provide prime vendor conversion number.  iii)	Vendor(s) must provide and attach a copy of all itemized brand(s) and styles that are manufactured and/or distributed for Safety Scalpels & Blades. iv)	Vendor(s) will list the industry production and safety standards used in manufacturing this product.

Provide and attach a copy of all latex free items. xiv)	Vendor(s) must be able t o provide a full product line of Safety Scalpels & Blades to include but not limited to: all sizes, types (retractable, shielded and/or disposable), individual & attached blades to handles, Safety Scalpel Handles with various lengths and sizes.                2.  Clinical Criteria Evaluation      A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.   i)	Ergonomically designed, well-balanced, blade and handle connection is stable, comfortable to hold, and can be used in either hand.  ii)	Safety feature is easy to use and recognized and requires minimal training.  iii)	Blade maintains its sharpness.  iv)	Blade size and blade handle size are easily identified from the packaging. v)	Safety feature can be activated/deactivated with one hand. vi)	Safety device does not activate passively.  vii)	Blade position is visible at all times on the sterile field.  viii)	Handle is slip resistant.  ix)	The device cannot be reused once the safety feature is permanently activated for disposal. x)	Package is easy to open and allows for aseptic delivery to the sterile field.       3.  Price Evaluation                  										                               Technical/company and Clinical/performance factors will be evaluated first.  The technical/company and clinical/performance evaluation will determine who the acceptable offerors are. Then the quotes will be compared regarding price and the TPRB will p erform a technical/price trade off (i.e., very superior technical capabilities may justify paying a higher price).

<SUBJECT>B -- ADVISORY COMMITTEE
<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Headquarters Directorate of Technology has a requirement for a standing committee of prominent scientists, engineers and government officials to provide investigative and advisory services on a wide range of cutting edge science and technologies with the potential to enhance the ability of the command?s operations.  The intended source is the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), a private, non-profit, self-perpetuating society of distinguished scholars engaged in scientific and engineering research, dedicated to the furtherance of science and technology. Under the authority of its charter granted by Congress in 1863 and Executive Order 12832 (January 19, 1993), the Academy mandate is to advise federal government on scientific and technical matters. This requirement establishes an advisory committee to support USSOCOM technology development similar to those already established for the Departments of the Air Force, Army and Navy. The standing committee shall investigate but not be limited to such activities as determining the technical merit of current USSOCOM efforts relative to state-of-the-art technologies; evaluating efficiency and effectiveness  in which current efforts are carried out and their impact on the mission; judging relevancy of current technologies to the USSOCOM mission; and analyzing the effective and efficient application of command resources to meet mission needs. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Citation 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), the Academy is the only source that can satisfy the agency needs. USSOCOM will rely on the experience and the unique attributes of the National Academy of Sciences to bring together state of the art technical expertise in advanced scientific, engineering and technical disciplines with application to special operation forces.  The standing committee will meet approximately four times annually to identify potential avenues for research and development, product demonstration and practical operational implementation of advanced science and technology.  Committee discussions may form the basis for development and coordination of additional National Research Council (NRC) activities, such as ad hoc studies, workshops or other activities responsive to the USSOCOM mission that draw on the expertise of all applicable units of the National Academies. The Air Force Studies Board, the Naval Studies Board, and the Board on Army Science and Technology (BAST), established by the NRC, have been providing this exact capability for the Military Departments with great success for over two decades.  This experience and expertise with DOD agencies uniquely qualifies the NRC to provide this service for USSOCOM.  The period of performance will be one year, with options for two additional years. NAICS code 541990. See Note 22.

<SUBJECT>A -- Carbon-Based Ultra-High Speed Electronics for Wafer-Scale Integration
<DESC>Over the past decade there has been significant progress in understanding the fundamental physical properties of carbon based electronic devices.  Carbon nanotube (CNT) transistors have been demonstrated with high mobilities (> 10X silicon), high thermal conductivity and excellent current carrying capabilities.  In addition, there have been very encouraging initial electronic studies of the planar form of carbon; single layer graphene, which offers the intriguing potential of planar fabrication processes.

The time is ripe for technological exploitation of these scientific discoveries for the benefit of the DoD.  The desirable physical properties of carbon electronic systems are particularly well suited for ultra-high speed analog device applications.  Key properties such as excellent electrostatic control for deeply scaled dimensions, high current carrying capabilities and excellent thermal conductivities are very desirable from the RF-mm wave technology point of view.  To further explore advanced research for potential DoD applications, the Microsystems Technology Office is sponsoring a workshop for researchers to present and discuss their novel ideas for the future of carbon-based electronics.

In this announcement, we are soliciting short white papers in the area of carbon electronics for RF-mm wave technology applications.  The white papers most relevant to this solicitation will be selected for participation in the DARPA workshop on carbon-based ultra-high speed electronics.  These papers should be no more than 3 pages in length (including figures and references) and briefly describe your problem statement, research goals, technical innovations, main challenges, and proposed approaches.  Some areas of particular interest include methods for producing highly aligned CNTs and sorting of semiconducting from metallic CNTs.  In the graphene field, methods of monolayer synthesis on insulating substrates as well as short channel transistor demonstrations are of particular interest.  The CNT or Graphene devices proposed must have clear potential for revolutionary performance advantages with respect to current state-of-the-art RF technology.  In addition, the carbon electronic devices proposed must be compatible with silicon process technology (for co-integration) and show clear potential for high performance complex circuit demonstrations.

Please note that this workshop is not a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts.  The workshop is planned for April 19-20, 2007 in Arlington, VA, and will be by invitation only.  If you have innovative ideas to address the interested technical areas as mentioned above, please send your white paper to Kristina Wihl (Kristina.wihl.ctr@darpa.mil) by March 21, 2007.  We will inform you of our decision by April 4, 2007.  A website with further information on the workshop and for registration will be provided at that time.  The government will not assume liability for costs incurred for travel expenses, presentations, marketing material, etc.  If there are questions related to the technical content of the workshop, please contact Michael Fritze (Michael.Fritze@darpa.mil) who is the MTO Program Manager sponsoring this workshop.

If dampers are to be replaced do you have a list of damper sizes?  On the Honeywell replacement are you looking to reuse any of the existing sensors, such as pressure transmitters, humidity sensors, relay, pressure switches or do you want all new?  The 30 CAV damper actuator need to be replaced not the dampers. The existing sensors, and pressure transmitters, humidity relay and pressure switches stay, but if contractor's computer software can't talk to the end device it will have to be changed with a compatible end device.

<DESC>This requirement is for the purchase of VMWare Server and Administrative Tools for the Washington Headquarters Services Information Technology Division Enterprise Services (ITMD/ESD). ITMD/ESD is in the process of consolidating all of the WHS server rooms into a Data Center and Basement Consolidation Server Room (BCSR). This virtualization application is required to allow multiple, virtual servers to be installed on a single physical server. The items required below are to accompany additional VMWare products and services that are already in place. The requested VMWare products under this procurement are:

0001)	VMM-VLM-STD-FND-C-VMWare Lab Manager Foundation Std. Bundle, 1 ea.

0002)	VMM-VLM-STD-FND-P-SSSC Platinum Support/Subscription VMWare Lab Mgr., 3 ea.

The BCSR currently uses IBM LS20 blade servers, which were designed to be used with the VMWare Virtualization Engine. Market research has revealed that other applications such as HP and Sun virtualization software will not work on the IBM LS20 blade server. Therefore, VMWare is the only known application to work properly on the IBM LS20 blade server. As such, no other brand, make or model will be accepted or considered for this procurement. 

The NAICS code for this procurement is 541519. The classification code for this action is 7379.

The government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from the results of this solicitation in accordance with FAR Part 12.6. All firms or individuals responding to this solicitation must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) located at http: www.ccr.gov.

 HSAR 3052.209?70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML-7017. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-15 dated 02/12/07. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), has been charged with performing basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing 6(six) bacterial pathogen genomes was performed towards achieving those goals. The RML has a need to purchase 2(two) lots of the RML custom chip #2 from the manufacturer. This chip is unique and specific to RML.  No other chip of its kind exists. These gene chips are a one-time-use-only consumable and will be consumed in RML experiments.  The contractor shall provide to RML services  to produce 2(two) lots of chips, totaling approximately 90(ninety) chips.  This is a 40(forty) day, one time work effort, where the final product will be 2(two) lots of RML custom gene chips, at 45(forty-five) chips per lot.  SCHEDULE:   The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix. the chip is high density,  at 106 per cm2 (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip? was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip? probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip? probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip? probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip? probe array is  housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array. We process the chips on our Affymetrix system which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray? Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix  is compatible with the Affymetrix system in place within the Genomics Unit of the Research Technologies Section.  FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.   Delivery shall be 5(five) weeks after receipt of the order by Affymetrix.  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.

<DESC>THIS IS AMENDMENT 0001, W912DR-07-S-0002, A SPECIAL NOTICE FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATIONS OR BIDS. Questions and Answers regarding the draft RFP for Integrated Design Bid Build (IDBB) How are National Environmental Policy Act requirements being addressed for this project?  As required by the National Environmental Policy Act, the Army is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the BRAC 2005 actions at Fort Belvoir, Virgini a. It is currently anticipated that this process will culminate in a Record of Decision (ROD) in September 2007. This procurement is based on the Armys preferred site plan as identified by the Army on July 27, 2006, which located the NGA campus at Enginee r Proving Ground. However, other alternatives are being evaluated in the EIS, and the siting for this project will not be final until the ROD is completed. Under this procurement, offerors will be asked to propose based on the projects preferred site as i dentified in the Request for Proposals, and proposals may be evaluated and a contract awarded on that basis. The contract may be awarded before the ROD is completed.  However, the Government will not initiate any physical construction work until the ROD is  finalized. If the site of the project identified in the ROD is different from that identified in this procurement, the Government will make the necessary modifications to the contract resulting from this procurement after contract award. When do you anticipate issuing an RFP for this project, and when do you anticipate contract award?  The Government currently anticipates issuing an RFP in April 2007, with subsequent award estimated in August 2007. Will there be additional opportunities for potential offerors to obtain information about this procurement prior to the issuance of the RFP?  The Government may schedule a pre-solicitation conference in early March 2007 at which the project designer will p resent a draft of the schematic design for the project. If this opportunity becomes available, it will be announced via the Federal Business Opportunities. What will be the source selection process used for this procurement?  This procurement will follow the one-step best value trade-off process identified for negotiated procurements in FAR Part 15. Additional details on the evaluation will be provided in the  RFP. Will stipends be provided to offerors?  The Government does not anticipate providing stipends to offerors for this procurement. What are the bonding requirements for this procurement?  As currently envisioned, offerors will be required to provide performance and payment bonds with the penal sum equal to 100% of the contract price. This is an area in which the Government is continui ng to consult with industry to determine whether there are more easily achievable bonding requirements that would achieve the Governments objectives. What type of contract will you be awarding as a result of this procurement?  This contract will be awarded as a Fixed Price Incentive (Successive Targets) contract (FAR 16.403-2). The Base Bid will be Firm Fixed Price. The optional construction portion of this contract will be administered according to FAR 16.403-2. See FAR 52.216-17 for detailed procedures and instructions related to cost and price administration for the Construction option. This clause requires the offeror to propose an Initial Target Pri ce and a Ceiling Price (GMP/Guarantee Maximum Price) for the option. It is anticipated that after the production point (approximately 100% design), the Government and the Contractor will negotiate a firm fixed price for the entire contract. What is the Initial Target Price?  The Initial Target Price is made up of two components, the Initial Target Cost and the Initial Target Profit. The Initial Target Price is the offerors best estimate of the true cost of the work. What is the Ceiling Price (GMP)?  The Ceiling Price (GMP) repres ents the Governments maximum liability for the scope of work identified in this procurement. What documents will be provided as a basis for offerors to propose an Initial Target Price and a Ceiling Price (GMP)?  The RFP will contain a schematic design for the project. This will include typical plans, elevations, and narratives. It is anticipated that most of the major building systems will be described in sufficient detail to supp ort an Initial Target Price and a Ceiling Price (GMP). Why is the Government seeking to establish an Initial Target Price and a Ceiling Price (GMP) based on a schematic design?  The Governments goal is to contract with a constructor as early as possible, allowing the Constructor to collaborate with the design  team. In order to comply with Federal procurement laws, regulations, and principles, the selection of the successful offeror must include price considerations, and the price competition must be based on the entire project requirement, not just an early ph ase of the project. Will price be an evaluation factor in determining the successful offeror?  Price will be an evaluation factor in determining the successful offeror for this procurement. Non-price factors (e.g., experience, qualifications, etc.), when combined, will be sig nificantly more important than price in the evaluation. The price evaluation will be based on the firm-fixed price base bid items and on the Ceiling Price (GMP) for the option. In addition, the Government will conduct a cost realism analysis on the offerors Initial Target Cost and Initial Target Profit. What is cost realism?  According to FAR 2.101, Cost realism means that the costs in an offerors proposal (1)Are realistic for the work to be performed; (2) Reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and (3) Are consistent with the various elemen ts of the offerors technical proposal. The draft RFP issued in the Sources Sought indicated the offeror must maintain Cost Accounting Standards in accordance with the applicable Contract Clauses  what does this mean?  This provision of the selection criteria has been revised. The requirement is for the offeror to have an approved accounting system. The approval will be f rom DCAA, or other cognizant Federal agency. The process is similar to what occurs in a standard Federal agency contract audit, where part of the review is to establish that the offeror has an adequate cost accounting system that allocates costs in a consi stent manner meeting requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and good accounting practice. Will this contract require use of an Earned Value Management System?  Yes, because this is an incentive contract over $50 M, DOD policy requires the contract include requirements for the contractor to use a validated Earned Value Management System (EVMS) in accordance with DFARS 252.242-7001, DFARS 252.242-7002, and the Guidelines for an EVMS contained in ANSI/EIA-748. Will you include an economic price adjustment clause in the proposed procurement?  Given the flexible nature of the IDBB contract vehicle, the Government does not currently plan to use an economic price adjustment clause in this procurement. The draft RFP indicated that the IDBB contractor would be responsible for the cost impact of all Designers of Record errors and omissions. Please clarify what responsibility the IDBB contractor has with respect to errors and omissions?  The language on thi s issue in the RFP has been removed. The Designer of Record retains responsibility for errors and omissions.  However, as part of the Construction Integration Phase services, the IDBB contractor will be expected to review and evaluate the design documents to help the project team identify and resolve errors. How will the Government ensure that all team members (i.e., both designer and constructor) work toward the same goals?  After award of the IDBB contract, the Government intends to modify the designers contra ct to align the design budget with the Initial Target Price established by the successful offeror for the IDBB contract. The Designers contract will include a contractual obligation to design a project within this funding limitation. In evaluating past performance, what criteria will the Government establish?  The Government is revising its evaluation criteria for this procurement based on industry feedback. Experience will be evaluated in the following categories: (1) comparable size (square feet); (2) comparable complexity; (3) local experience; (4) experience in a CM/GMP environment; (5) experience with fast-track construction. Will the Government consider lowering the $500 million threshold for past performance?  This dollar limitation has been removed from the RFP. Will USACE develop a master site logistics plan and strategy for the EPG construction site?  Yes, this will be addressed in the RFP. How will Small Business Utilization be evaluated?  The evaluation will be two-fold: past performance, and the proposed subcontracting plan for this project. The Proposal Submission Instructions will identify the small business goals. How will fast-track construction be accommodated?  The Government anticipates fast-tracking the construction for this project. It is anticipated that discrete 100% design packages representing a portion of the overall project will be issued to the contract or. Within 45 days after receipt of each final construction package the contractor shall submit an estimated cost for that work and an estimated cost to complete the project. The purpose of this is to assure the Government that the project is on budget. On ce this requirement is completed to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer, a notice to proceed for that package will be issued. The contract will be administered according to FAR 16.403-2. See FAR 52.216-17 for detailed procedures and instructions related to cost and price administration for each of the fast-track construction packages up until the time that the contractor and the Government negotiate a Firm Fixed Price for the entire contract (after the production point or 100% design completion). However, the Governments maximum obligation under the contract shall not exceed the offerors Ceiling Price. All interested offerors will have the opportunity to respond to solicitation announcements at a later time.  This sources sought announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicite d.  No response is required.  NO APPOINTMENTS OR TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  All offerors are encouraged to visit the Baltimore District's public website, Current Acquisition Opportunities http://www.nab.usace.army.mil/ebs.htm or the Federal Busines s Opportunities web page http://www.fedbizopps.gov (USE THE BALTIMORE DISTRICT ACRONYM W912DR IN THE SEARCH FEATURE) to view other Baltimore District business opportunities.  It is imperative that all Small Disadvantaged businesses contact their cognizant Small Business Administration  Office to obtain Small Disadvantaged Business Certification.  Without SBA SDB certification, a prime contractor nor a federal agency can receive SDB credit when utilizing non-certified SDB contractors/subcontractors.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis and solicitation.

I	Description of Requirement.

Federal agencies relocating to the new Federal building, 90 Seventh St., San Francisco, CA  94103, have a requirement for satellite TV service. The Federal building is near completion and agencies are scheduled to begin moving into the building in March 2007. 

The building consists of two structures: an eighteen-story tower with raised floors and a four-story conventional building. The building (both structures) is supported by a standard cable infrastructure with two identical IDF closets on each floor.  All horizontal cable in the building is Cat 5E.  The design of the tower portion of the building is designed as a green building. There is very limited space in the existing conduits to support the installation of horizontal coaxial cable. Therefore, the contractor must use existing, Government-furnished, Cat 5E to connect to the end device. 

At this time, there is no TV service to each floor and to the office spaces. Therefore, this requirement consists of delivering satellite TV service from the commercial carrier to the various agencies throughout the building.

	1. Deliver satellite TV service to approximately 50 users using existing, Government-furnished Cat 5E cable.

	2. Install Cat 5E distribution hubs (equal to or better than Endeleo brand) and terminate on Government-furnished Cat 5E jacks on the customers' Cat 5E patch panel, Data Two jack, unless specified differently by the agency.

	3. Provide and install all equipment and cabling in accordance with industry specifications.

	4. Provide, at a minimum, the following 12 channels:

1	        KTVU (2) - Independent FOX; 
2	        KNTV (11) - NBC San Jose; 
3	        KPIX (5) - CBS San Francisco; 
4	        KGO (7) - ABC San Francisco; 
5	        Weather Channel; 
6	        Bloomberg; 
7	        Fox News Channel; 
8	        CNBC; 
9	        MSNBC; 
10	        CNN; 
11	        CSPAN-1; 
12	        CSPAN-2. 

	5. Complete all work no later than March 31, 2007.

II	Instructions for submission of quote.

	1. Itemize all equipment, quantities, unit prices, and amounts. 

	2. Provide the title of each labor category, number of hours, hourly rate, and amount.

	3. Describe the sequence of work that will be performed from start to completion. Providing a milestone schedule is desirable.

	4. Provide three references for similar work completed within the past two years, including contract number, brief description of the work, name and telephone number of the point of contact, and name and address of the work location.

III.	Evaluation Criteria

Evaluation of offers will be based on three factors: technical description, including items offered; past performance; and price. To be considered technically acceptable, the offeror must clearly demonstrate the firm is capable of performing the required work and completing it on or before March 31, 2007.

IV	Method of Award

The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures.

V	Government Points of Contact

Any questions of a technical nature or requests for site visits should be directed to Mr. John Archdeacon at (415) 522-4530 or via e-mail at john.archdeacon@gsa.gov. All other questions or concerns should be directed to Jo Ann Lew at (415) 522-4550 or via e-mail at joann.lew@gsa.gov.

VI	Due Date for Receipt of Quotes

Your offer is due on or before 4:00 PM local time, Friday, March 2, 2007, and should be sent via e-mail to Jo Ann Lew at the above address. No late offers will be accepted or considered.

Vendor questions and the Government's answers are provided below.

Q1. The solicitation is requesting TV service to approximately 50 users using Endeleo hubs. Since the Endeleo FG-TVM-1600 Hub has 16 ports, should we provide a price for 3 Hubs (for up to only 48 users) or should we provide a price for 4 Hubs that will provide service for up to 64 users.	

A1. For evaluation purposes, include four (4) hubs in your quote.

Q2. An Endeleo User Module will be required at each television location, so do you want us to provide pricing for the same number of users as we have ports (48 or 64) or do you want the number of user modules to match the number of televisions that you will be using?

A2. For evaluation purposes, pricing should be based on 64 ports.

Q3. Do you already have the television sets for each user location?

A3. Government agencies are responsible for providing and may already have television sets.

Q4. The output of the Endeleo User Module is Audio/Video and the module does not have an RF output (channel 3, 4 etc.)  Do the TV's have an Audio/Video Input?	

A4. Individual agencies will be responsible for providing television sets with the required capabilities.

Q5. The Endeleo user Module can sit on top of a TV or can be hidden behind a wall mounted LCD or Plasma TV. If the module is hidden, a remote IR sensor will be needed. Will we mount the user module on TV or behind the TV?	

A5. For evaluation purposes, assume half will be mounted on the TV and half behind the TV.

Q6. The Endeleo User Module has front panel push buttons for up/down channel selection. An Endeleo remote control is optional. Do you want the remote controls?

A6. Yes, please include remote controls.

Q7. What is the approximate distance from the dish location (on roof) to the satellite receiver in the headend room?

A7. For evaluation purposes, assume the distance is 500 feet.

Q8. Do you foresee any problem with us getting the coax cables from the dish on the roof to the satellite receivers in the headend room?

A8. There should be no problem installing your cable. The Government has identified the path from the rooftop through the ceiling on the 4th floor of the Annex to Room B331 (MDF ROOM) in the basement.  (END)
