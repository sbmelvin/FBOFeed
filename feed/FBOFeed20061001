<SUBJECT>Research And Development For Expeditionary Warfare And Coastal Operation
<DESC>N61331-BAA-07-01:  The Naval Surface Warfare Center , Panama City (NSWC PC) conducts research and development of techniques and technologies directed toward operations in a littoral environment in support of expeditionary warfare and coastal operations. NSWC PC’s mission includes mine warfare (both mine countermeasures (MCM) and mining), amphibious warfare, diving and life support, special warfare, and other missions conducted in the coastal region. Within these mission areas, NSWC PC  is responsible for the full spectrum of research, development and acquisition, and support functions. Typical functions include fundamental research; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; logistics; and development of operational concepts and tactics. NSWC PC is interested in receiving proposals for research and development in all of its mission areas. This notice constitutes a Broad!   Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)2. It is intended that this BAA be open from 1 Oct 2006 to 30 Sep 2007. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: (1) environmental data collection, monitoring, analysis, or display; (2) multifunction underwater sensing designs and technology; (3) image and sensor data processing; (4) modeling and simulation; (5) innovative conventional and non-conventional systems for MCM, amphibious warfare, naval mining, diving and life support, homeland security, force protection or special warfare tactics, techniques, procedures applicable to all phases of the battle timeline including surveillance, targeting, acquisition, and all terminal phases including amphibious logistics and the moving of cargo from afloat to ashore, consistent with ship-to-objective-maneuver and sea basing concepts; (6) shipboard system modular integration concepts; (7) innovative and non conventional concepts for application of technolo!  gy, engineering and systems to support coastal operations and coastal  warfare including waterproofing, shock mitigation and isolation, and human systems interfaces; (8) lasers, radar, millimeter wave, or other high energy sensors or weapons; (9) command, control, communication, localization, navigation, guidance and data transmission  in the air, sea, or thru the ground; (10) concepts and systems for remote control of sea mines; (11) autonomous and remotely controlled vehicles: air, surface, sea surface, undersea or ground; (12) Techniques or methods to increase the autonomy of current unmanned vehicles (air, surface, sea surface, or ground); (13) information processing, fusion, and display;  (14) data fusion/correlation for applications involving methodologies to translate/correlate data between different acoustic sensors/frequencies so that data/images taken with one sensor can be translated into equivalent data/images with another system; (15) Chemical / Biological individual protection; (16) Kinetic and mechanistic studies of atmospheric t!  ransformations in enclosed environments;  (17) life cycle cost reduction initiatives (i.e., reductions in total ownership cost). Proposals may be submitted by any commercial firm, Institution of higher education (other than federal government) with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such entities. NSWC PC encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities. The following guidelines apply to concept papers or proposals. Typically each proposal may be: (1) funded incrementally for periods up to three years subject to the availability of appropriations; (2) on average, be funded between $10,000 to $1,000,000, with the size of each dependent upon the topic (although NSWC PC  reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds); (3) more than one effort may be funded for an individual topic; (4) NSWC PC  is not interested in concepts that already have been developed or proven (even if they never have been sold before); (5) NSWC PC  is seeking proposals for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding; and (6) deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation rather than focus on a specific system or hardware solution. Proposals for evolutionary engineering of improvements are inappropriate!   under BAA authority and are not allowed. In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as an initial step, interested parties should submit concept or  white  papers briefly summarizing the technical direction, relevance and scope of the proposed effort, and a brief synopsis of qualifications based on accomplishments, and provide a rough order of magnitude cost. White papers should be no more than 5-7 pages in length. White papers (and any resulting proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific, technical, and socio-economic merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential naval relevance and contributions of the effort to NSWC PC specific mission areas; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to NSWC PC  programs are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered to NSWC PC with unrestricte!  d (Government Purpose) rights; (4) The offerors capabilities, related  experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; (6) Realism of the proposed cost and the availability of funds. Based on evaluation of the White papers, participants may be selected and invited to submit full technical and cost proposals for evaluation by NSWC PC using the above noted evaluation criteria. An invitation to submit a full proposal does not guarantee funding. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. For efforts funded as legally binding commitments, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned !  small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities. This is to notify potential proposers that each grant or cooperative agreement that may be placed under this announcement or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause:  As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents, the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students. If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause!  , the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agree ment and all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements, and it may suspend or terminate such grants and agreements unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award.  If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any grant, including any existing grant; (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a grant or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation.
