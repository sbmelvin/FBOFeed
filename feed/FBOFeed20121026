<DESC>In concert with the guidance promulgated by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense Research and Engineering (ASD - R&amp;E) and National Information Infrastructure (ASD - NII), concerning Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR), which deals with the mitigation of denial of Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT), this effort is concerned with the first two of the three elements: Electronic Protection (EP) and Electronic Support (ES). Please note that this effort does not address Electronic Attack (EA). Precision navigation and timekeeping are essential for many modern naval and maritime systems, and it is essential that navigation and timekeeping services be made available to platforms and weapons at the highest level of accuracy and with the highest possible confidence at reasonable cost. Lack of precise navigation and timekeeping technologies may jeopardize the success of military operations. For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) provides highly accurate position/time information at low cost and, due to this, GPS has become the technology of choice for many users. Unfortunately, the GPS signal is a low-power signal that is susceptible to interference. Therefore, there is a need for (1) affordable approaches to make GPS more reliable/robust, and (2) methods of quantifying threats to GPS performance that may be termed "situational awareness" and (3) affordable and reliable precision navigation/timing alternatives to GPS.
<p>The ONR Navigation and Timekeeping Technology Program seeks new and innovative navigation technologies that will provide more accurate, reliable, maintainable, and affordable systems for Naval air, surface, subsurface, and ground platforms and forces.</p>

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development, USAID/RDMA intends to issue a solicitation for <strong>the ASEAN-U.S. Partnership for Good Governance, Equitable and Sustainable Development and Security (ASEAN-U.S. PROGRESS)</strong> activity to provide technical assistance, training, materials, and other resources as needed to support and enhance ASEAN's capacity to advance good governance and regional security, and to promote equitable and sustainable human development in Southeast Asia in line with ASEAN Political-Security and Socio-Cultural Blueprints, as well as the ASEAN-U.S. Enhanced Partnership Plan of Action 2011-2015 (PoA). The activity will also provide technical assistance to the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta, Indonesia, in order to expand its capacity to facilitate and support meetings, agreements and protocols and outreach central to ASEAN's regional integration agenda.
<p>The overall development goal of the activity is to enhance ASEAN's ability to advance good governance, regional security and equitable and sustainable human development. It will focus on improving regional responses and ASEAN-U.S. cooperation to address emerging regional and global challenges. The activity will contribute to the overall ASEAN-U.S. Partnership Program effort.</p>
<p>The component objectives of the activity are: (a) enhancing ASEAN's ability to advance good governance and political and security integration, particularly in the areas of public-private sector dialogue, promotion of human rights, cooperation to combat transnational crimes and non-traditional security threats; (b) enhancing ASEAN's ability to advance socio-cultural integration, particularly in the areas of women's and children's rights, disaster management, and the capacity and quality of science-based policy-making; and (c) supporting the ASEAN Secretariat's function to facilitate and support meetings, agreements and protocols central to the three Pillars, as well as Secretariat's implementation of the ASEAN-U.S. PoA, the Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI), and the Masterplan on Connectivity, particularly in the areas of project management, capacity for outreach and use of ICT in Secretariat's activities. In addition, the activity will incorporate coordination and communications support for overall USAID assistance to ASEAN. Reflecting the demand-driven nature of U.S. assistance to ASEAN and to take advantage of "windows of opportunity" that were not present or accounted for at the design/award stage, the activity will provide flexibility to address other relevant elements of the ASEAN Community Blueprints and the ASEAN-U.S. PoA.</p>
<p>USAID/RDMA envisions a combination of technical assistance, training and grants (for either U.S. or ASEAN-region based organizations) to ensure rapid response to emerging opportunities to achieve activity objectives. USAID also places emphasis on the utilization of regional expertise and partnerships in the provision of technical assistance.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate USAID to release a solicitation or award a contract nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal. In addition, final award cannot be made until funds have been fully appropriated, allocated, and committed and internal USAID procedures have been completed. This notice satisfies the synopsis requirement in FAR 5.201.</p>

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development, USAID/RDMA intends to release a solicitation for <strong>the ASEAN Connectivity through Trade and Investment (ACTI)</strong> activity to provide technical assistance, training, materials, and other resources as needed to accelerate the implementation of select components of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community Blueprint.
<p>ASEAN is advancing economic integration among its Member States through a harmonized system of protocols and implementation regimes governing intra- and extra-regional investment flows, trade, and the production and movement of goods and services within ASEAN member states and beyond. The activity will focus on assisting ASEAN's regional economic-related working bodies as well as national level assistance in several ASEAN member states to implement their commitments under the ASEAN Economic Community so that the whole of ASEAN will derive the benefits of an integrated and harmonized customs, trading, and investment regime by 2015. The activity will also support overall United States Government economic cooperation with ASEAN, which occurs through various economic agencies in support of the ASEAN-U.S. Trade and Investment Framework Arrangement (TIFA) and other relevant agreements.</p>
<p>The overall development goal of the activity is to strengthen ASEAN integration by expanding capacity in trade, investment and human capital to enable ASEAN to drive its realization of ASEAN Economic Community and integration into the global economy. It will contribute to the overall ASEAN-U.S. Partnership Program effort.</p>
<p>The component objectives of the activity are: (a) strengthened regional integration utilizing an operational ASEAN Single Window architecture, improved terms of trade in the ASEAN region, greater ASEAN member country capacity to implement Single Window systems, and continuation of trade enhancing reforms and standards harmonization in priority industry sectors in collaboration with the private sector; (b) improved capacity of ASEAN Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), particularly in less-developed Members States, to bridge the development gap allowing for effective and leveled participation in the ASEAN Economic Community; (c) strengthen ASEAN capacity to implement its ICT Master Plan; and, (d) increased capacity of ASEAN Member States to facilitate delivery of clean energy and energy efficient technologies to their citizens. Reflecting the demand-driven nature of U.S. assistance to ASEAN and to take advantage of "windows of opportunity" that were not present or accounted for at the design/award stage, the activity will provide flexibility to address relevant elements of the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint and the ASEAN-U.S. Enhanced Partnership Plan of Action (2011-2015).</p>
<p>USAID/RDMA envisions a combination of technical assistance, training and grants (for either U.S. or ASEAN Member State-based organizations) to ensure rapid response to emerging opportunities to achieve activity objectives. USAID also places emphasis on the utilization of regional expertise and partnerships in the provision of technical assistance.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate USAID to release a solicitation or award a contract nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal. In addition, final award cannot be made until funds have been fully appropriated, allocated, and committed and internal USAID procedures have been completed. This notice satisfies the synopsis requirement in FAR 5.201.</p>

In making such a determination, GSA will consider cost factors including, but not limited to, the total cost of the physical move (including telecommunications and computer cabling costs); tenant improvement costs (whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent); and anticipated rent for the space. Other factors impacting the Government's rights under a prospective lease, such as the length of any firm term that may be required at an alternative location, length of time necessary to deliver occupancy-ready space, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term, will also bear.</p>
<p>Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building's ownership. If you desire to submit a location for inspection, please forward information by 5:00 PM local Mountain Time, November 9, 2012. Expressions of interest can be accepted by mail, e-mail or fax.

This project requires complete design documentation to renovate the existing Oncology Clinic in the fourth floor of the Malcom Randall VA Medical Center, in Gainesville, Florida.  Rooms in the unit shall be design in accordance with the VA Design Manual and Space Planning Criteria.  

The design of this project will address, but will not be limited to, the following items:

1.	Asbestos abatement of floor tiles and mastic as well as HVAC/Pipe insulation materials will also be included as part of the renovation.
2.	Upgrade HVAC system for the area. Operational parameters, and its associated equipment, shall be monitored at the Graphics Control area through the existing Siemenstm Emergency Management System (EMS).  
3.	Upgrade of all room / area finishes, including walls, flooring, and ceiling. Colors to be coordinated with the VA Interior Designer.
4.	The area will be active during renovations. Phasing is critical to insure minimal interruption of operations. Alternatively for phasing is converting the sun deck located proximal to 4A to interior space, and would allow a temporary location for the infusion room.  After the infusion room renovation is complete, this converted sun deck space could be converted to additional exam rooms to allow the oncology service to function as an independent clinic and free up clinic space in the 4C medical clinic.
5.	Availability of utilities, especially emergency power.
6.	Access to the construction area should be included in the plan.  As a general rule the VA does not want this traffic through the hospital.
7.	Conduct thorough site investigation(s) to support the redesign/reconfiguration of all existing architectural, structural, mechanical, and electrical facilities associated with the installation of the new work. 
8.	Make recommendations on construction phasing to minimize the impact on regular facility operations, especially during utility shut downs. 
9.	The AE firm is required to coordinate with the VA Staff for site visits as indicate below.
10.	Maximize the space utilization as well as the best patient flow design shall follow.  
11.	Construction to be performed afterhours or weekends.

The detailed project design should begin with the above-mentioned intense on-site physical survey and collection of previous project data.

All designs shall incorporate all architectural and engineering disciplines necessary to provide for a complete and functional design.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers.

Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs.

Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List.

When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source. The Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with MorningStar Inc. for MorningStar research software. The Government intends to award a contract for a base period of two years.
<p><br />A sole source to MorningStar Inc. is intended for this order, based on the fact that they are the sole manufacturer of the software and there are no resellers. No other known source has the capabilities to provide this software.</p>
<p><br />MorningStar, Inc. is an independent investment research company which categorizes funds by their actual holdings. Mutual funds are rated from one to five stars based on how well they've performed (after adjusting for risk and accounting for all sales charges) in comparison to similar funds. Within each MorningStar Category, the top 10% of funds receive five stars.</p>
<p><br />The available software tools are used by the OCC/OTS 401K investment committee in conducting it's fiduciary responsibilities. The team uses these tools to research and analyze funds for inclusion in the plan lineup, designating which funds as Watch List, and post appropriate relative data on the OCCNet in order to meet the committee's fiduciary responsibilities.</p>
<p><br />No solicitation document is available. The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than seven days after publication of this notice. Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement, at terms more advantageous to the Government. A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Waters.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposals. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of the business community for the requirement as described below. All interested parties, including all categories of small businesses (small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone small businesses, etc.) are invited to submit a response to the market research questions set forth below that address resource capabilities. <br />The acquisition will be for one (1) 12-month period with four (4) 12-month options. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 611710 and 624110.
<p><br />THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposal; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Office of Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) provides benefits, counseling and personnel services to NRC employees, which enhances the balance of work and family responsibilities and assists NRC in recruiting and retaining the skills necessary to accomplish its mission. As such, OCHCO plans, implements, and monitors a full range of employee benefits; plays an active leadership role in the development of new initiatives; and serves as an agency-wide clearinghouse for information on employee benefits and other related programs.</p>
<p>Congress enacted Public Law 107-67 (hereinafter referred to as the Act), which permits Federal agencies to assist their lower income Federal employees with the costs of child care. This legislation allows Federal agencies to provide subsidies directly to the child care provider and thus, can reduce the amount of money that parents pay for childcare. To be eligible to participate in this program, the child care provided must be from a family child care home or child care center. Either type of care must be licensed and/or regulated by the State and/or local authorities where the service is provided.</p>
<p>The NRC has established a child care subsidy program and is seeking sources capable of administering its child care subsidy program. Sources must be able to 1) determine subsidy eligibility and subsidy amount; 2) notify parents and child care providers; 3) estimate funding for subsidy payments; 4) ensure child care providers are licensed/regulated by state and/or local authorities and; 5) provide payment to child care providers.</p>
<p>Please complete the Market Research Questions (set forth below). All capability statements must be submitted electronically via e-mail, to MLita.Carr@nrc.gov no later than November 9, 2012 in either MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF). In the subject line please include the following: Child Care Subsidy Program - Market Research. The page limitation is not to exceed three (3) pages; the Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the requested information. Submission of additional materials such as glossy brochures or videos is discouraged. Telephone inquiries or facsimile are not acceptable. This market survey is being conducted through the FedBizOpps to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information.</p>
<p>If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Organization name, address, e-mail address, web site address and telephone number. <br /><br />2. Provide the size and type of ownership of the organization.<br /><br />3. What size is your business with respect to NAICS Code 611710 and 624110 (i.e. "Small" or "Other Than Small"? If your organization is a small business under the aforementioned NAICS code, what type of small business, (i.e. small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone small businesses, etc.)? Specify all that apply.<br /><br />4. Number of years your business has been in operation.<br /><br />5. Describe the types of work and technical disciplines your company&nbsp;offers.<br /><br />6. List any companies or government agencies your company has performed work for related to the type of services described above in the past years.<br /><br />7. Has your company previously faced organizational conflict of interest issues with NRC? How were they resolved?<br /><br />8. Describe any other information your company deems relevant to supporting the services described above.</p>

<DESC>**PLEASE SEE ATTACHMENT FOR COMPLETE RFI**<br />PMO: Office of the Chief Medical Officer
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is to gather material on requirements for developing or adopting a dynamic Health and Wellness Assessment (HWA) that is accessible to all Department of Defense (DoD) beneficiaries.  The HWA should have a standardized, evidence-based, core question set that will facilitate the ability of the Military Health System (MHS) to assess the health, wellness and at-risk behaviors of its beneficiaries.  Data sources include: self-reported information and biometric data from the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) and eventually the Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR), other possible sources (e.g. - mobile apps) and data captured from purchased care.  Collated information sources will be assessed and beneficiaries will receive an online "Well-Being Plan," in addition to a medical team, which has not only been specifically designated to them, but which should also receive this plan at the point of care (POC).  The Well-Being Plan consists of a personalized summary of the overall well-being of each beneficiary, and offers actionable steps that can be taken to improve well-being.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI should provide an understanding of existing capabilities, performance outcomes from previous experience, rough magnitude of schedule and variables which could impact schedule.  Furthermore, responses should include a description of services, amenable contract structures and any unique requirements not addressed in this RFI.</p>

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) provides radio and antenna material solutions to the Marine Corps. Dismounted Marines often encounter low hanging wires, which present an electric shock hazard.  When dismounted Marines operate handheld or manpack radios with long whip or blade antennas, the risk of electrical shock increases.  This RFI seeks information on innovative ways to reduce the risk of electrical shocks from low overhead wires for dismounted radio operators as well as vehicle mounted Marines.  MARCORSYSCOM is researching short and long term solutions to reduce the risk of electrical shock for radio operators, while maintaining radio performance.

For maximum range and reliability, the dismounted Marine requires the antenna to be light, flexible and extendable.
  Long whip antennas (6 to 10 ft) exhibit good size and weight characteristics for the performance they provide, but pose greater risk due to their length and all-metal construction.  Intermediate length blade antennas (3 to 4 ft) are more manageable but are not designed for the electrical safety of the operator.  The antennas/solutions of most interest are for use with handheld and manpack tactical radios in the High Frequency (HF) and lower Very High Frequency (VHF) bands (2 to 88 MHz).  The following radios use these bands:  AN/PRC150, AN/PRC-117F, AN/PRC-117G and AN/PRC-152.  

MARCORSYSCOM is seeking products and product designs that will exhibit equivalent or better radiation pattern and omnidirectional gain to the targeted antenna while providing high voltage protection to 20KV RMS (35KV RMS(objective)).
  

MARCORSYSCOM may, at their option, seek to meet with vendors offering the most promising solutions to better understand the capabilities of the suggested products and/or solutions.

THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  NO STATEMENT OF WORK, SPECIFICATION OR REQUIREMENTS PACKAGE IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR RELEASE.

e) The Contractor shall VA "brand" the instruction for use sheet contained inside each envelope, per VA approval 
f) The Contractor shall use destruction methods that are in compliance with all applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and local State regulations for destruction of household consumer pharmaceuticals.  As part of destruction process, the pharmaceuticals shall be deemed at the end as non-retrievable and non-recognizable.  Contractor shall supply monthly reports showing the number of envelopes received, number of envelopes destroyed, number of envelopes pending destruction, the total weight of envelopes, and listing of any exceptions (i.e. envelopes showing tampering) 
g)  All packaging received from veteran shall remain sealed throughout the handling process, with the understanding that it shall be properly disposed of via an approved EPA destruction process
h)  The Contractor shall work with Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Services to customize welcome kits to include displays and informational training on the process.  Welcome Kits shall include: posters advertising the program; introductory letter from the company to the staff about the program; cardboard desk stand-up signs advertising the program; bag stuffers advertising the program; and, Portable Document Format (pdf) file so facilities can print if additional supply is needed

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source: The Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Agilent Technologies, Inc. for a Service Contract for existing Agilent equipment located in the Beltsville, Maryland and Walnut Creek, California labs. The Government intends to award a contract for a base period of one year and two option years.
<p><br />The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau's Labs had previously acquired the Agilent instrument systems and now have a requirement for a service contract to maintain these systems. A sole source to Agilent Technologies, Inc. is intended for this order, based on the fact that Agilent is the sole supplier of Agilent's Proprietary software updates and hardware components for these sophisticated systems. Agilent also has the authorized technical staff with the familiarity, expertise and capability of repairing and servicing the current Agilent analytical equipment systems.</p>
<p><br />A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. No solicitation document is available. If no affirmative written response is received, that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Agilent Technologies, Inc. Telephone inquires will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The VAHCS Bay Pines has awarded a sole source commercial service continuation to Central Admixture Pharmacy Services, Inc. (CAPS). This acquisition is for: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is an intravenous feeding method indicated for those patients who require complete bowel rest or fail to obtain nourishment from a dysfunctional gastrointestinal tract.   The full daily caloric requirement can be met with parenteral delivery of macronutrients (carbohydrates, amino acids, and fats), as well as the replacement of micronutrients (electrolytes, minerals, vitamins, and other additives), tailored to the individual patient.  The majority of calories are supplied with carbohydrates, followed by lipids, then amino acids.  TPN can be a life saving treatment for patients who are not able to absorb nutrition from their gut, but it can also lead to many severe complications if not formulated and prepared appropriately. TPN solutions at BPVAHCS are prepared by a technician and a pharmacist using aseptic technique in an ISO Class 7 sterile room in an ISO Class 5 Laminar Flow Hood to ensure sterility.  The pharmacy staff uses a Baxter compounding machine to custom prepare the macronutrient base of the TPNs.  Then the electrolytes, minerals, and other additives are individually and manually drawn up into syringes and injected into the TPN base.  There are several series of double and triple checks throughout this process to ensure the complex TPN solution is formulated correctly.  Currently, Bay Pines dictates a standard hang time of 1800 for all TPN solution bags; to meet this hang time, all orders should be submitted by 1300.  Preparation and delivery of TPN must meet VHA, FDA and JCAHO admixture standards.  Several factors favor the outsourcing of the preparation of the TPN solutions by the pharmacy department.  A total of approximately seven (7) TPN will be delivered daily, three hundred and sixty-five (365) days a year to 10,000 Bay Pines Blvd., Bay Pines, FL  33744.  Total Parenteral Nutrition Services has a more cost efficient model of preparing the TPN for the period of 1 October 2012- 31 March 2013.  The North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) is 325412 and the size standard is 750.  This NOTICE OF CONTRACTING ACTION (NCOA) is for the notification purpose only and does not constitute a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The VAHCS Bay Pines has awarded a sole source commercial service continuation to Information Control Management Corporation. This acquisition is for:   software and hardware support from Information Control Management Group as this system provides the necessary inventory tracking of medical supplies and equipment used throughout the hospital on a daily  basis. Loss of this service would impact patient care in areas such as surgery, ICU, SICU, Pathology and Laboratory, Nuclear Medicine and many other areas of the hospital. Without the inventory tracking system software and hardware service it is impossible to inventory and track the distribution of supplies.

The period of performance of this emergent bridge contract will be 1 October 2012- 31 March 2013.  Once the VA has awarded the bridge contract for this service, the VA will immediately begin the process of seeking open market competition for this requirement in order to obtain the best value to the government on a base plus option years contract.

<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">Notice of Intent to Issue a Sole Source Modification</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Solicitation Number: Not applicable (no solicitation will be issued)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Notice Type: Combined Synopsis/Solicitation</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Synopsis:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Added: October 26, 2012</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">NAICS Code: 541330 Engineering Services</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Size Standard: $10 million.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service, Rocky Mountain Region (Region 8) in Denver, Colorado, intends to issue a sole source modification in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to extend the performance period from November 1, 2012, through December 31, 2012. &nbsp;The current task order, set to expire October 31, 2012, provides operations, maintenance, and development engineering services in support of the Networked Training Center - Luke (NTC-L), including for general and specialized computers and peripheral devices used in the conduct and performance of formal flight training, analysis and training development, at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. GSA has received quotes in response to a new requirement supporting NTC-L which was issued against GSA&rsquo;s Alliant Government-wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) and is very close to finalizing its award.&nbsp; Unfortunately, GSA requires a few more weeks in order to complete its evaluation and selection.<strong> </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Therefore, this sole source modification is necessary to bridge the gap between the current task order and the new award, thereby ensuring the overlap of task order performance required for the achievement of a smooth transition and continuous high-level service for NTC-L, especially during the Virtual Flag 13-1 exercise described in more detail below.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Description of the work to be performed: Contractor is to furnish all material, labor, equipment, and supervision to accomplish sustainment of and concurrency of the NTC-L F-16 simulators located at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. The contractor will continue to investigate, analyze, plan, procure, manage, integrate, and test new technologies and capabilities in the NTC-L facility.&nbsp; The contractor will continue to provide all engineering development during the course of this extended performance period, and ensure hardware continues to be 100% government-owned and the government continues to retain unlimited rights to all software (with the exception of licensed third-party software).&nbsp; Additionally, beginning November 9 through November 16, 2012, NTC-L will be participating in the Virtual Flag 13-1 Air Force-wide exercise, which is a Air Force-wide sponsored event that involves aircrew and non-aircrew simulator devices across the Department of Defense to provide realistic operational training.&nbsp; It is a multi-service endeavor requiring detailed coordination and planning and testing has already begun in preparation of the exercise.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This modification is needed to facilitate continuation of services. A lapse in service will have a highly detrimental effect on the mission of NTC-L.&nbsp; NTC-L will not be able to train new pilots and keep up currency qualifications on current pilots.&nbsp; This would greatly affect the Air Force&rsquo;s ability to fight the &ldquo;War on Terror.&rdquo;<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span>Additionally, an extension will allow for a 30 day transition period necessary for high-level service during kick-off of the new requirement, which would be impossible during a USAF-wide exercise.<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span>This modification will provide services without disruption for the operation NTC-L by the incumbent contractor that holds current security clearances and that is also familiar with the complexity of the facility and the equipment. &nbsp;Lockheed Martin is the incumbent contractor and is fully capable of continuing to perform for the additional 60-day performance period. <span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, as no solicitation package will be issued. However, if a vendor believes it has the necessary qualifications (including without limitation, facility security clearances beginning November 1, 2012, through December 31, 2012, for all personnel providing services for this work) to meet these requirements, it must give notification and proof of the necessary qualifications via e-mail to Heidi Sawyer, Contracting Officer, at <a href="mailto:heidi.sawyer@gsa.gov">heidi.sawyer@gsa.gov</a> &nbsp;on or before October 29, 2012 at 5:00pm MT.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level.

<DESC>GENERAL INFORMATION
<p>This is a Performance Work Statement (PWS) for contracting of two real property appraisal reports for use in negotiating to exchange real property between the U.S. Government and the City of Sioux City, Iowa, at the Sioux City Gateway Airport/Col. Bud Day Field.</p>
<p>Mission<br />Complete all necessary appraisal tasks to submit two separate narrative appraisal reports in summary report form, which will be reviewed for acceptable information content, clarity, technical merit and reasonableness, and be approved to then facilitate exchanging the fee ownership of the respective parcels between their owners.</p>
<p>Vision<br />Sioux City seeks to promote private growth and development to the south of the airport. The Air Force desires to unite its contiguous fee ownership, now split by Harbor Drive. <br />Exchange of Fee Interest in Lands (see following page)<br />Sioux City proposes a land exchange with the Air Force to support the City's efforts to reroute Harbor Drive to promote growth and development to the south of the airport. Harbor Drive is a public highway that divides the Air Force ownership into two parcels. The acquisition of Harbor Drive will create a contiguous Air Force ownership. The exchange will entail the Air Force deeding approximately 3.97Ac. of its land to the City for a relocated Harbor Drive, in exchange for the City deeding an approximate 3.97Ac. portion of the current Harbor Drive to the Air Force to unite its ownership.</p>
<p>Market Value Appraisals of Real Property by an Appraiser<br />At such time that a tract of land is identified, a willing seller is confirmed, and the tract is determined mutually beneficial to the exchange parties, a title commitment is obtained by the Corps and an appraisal is developed by an independent appraiser to determine the market value of the <br />parcels and the rights to be exchanged.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

All equipment must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.
Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.

Only the use of approved commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard equipment will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  
All parts delivered shall be in an airworthy condition and in all respects suitable for installation on a United States Coast Guard (USCG) aircraft.  Aircraft parts shall be manufactured in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulation Part 21 or alternate standards approved by the Engineering Division, USCG Aircraft Logistics Center (ALC).  Parts must be new unless otherwise stated herein. 

 Full and clear traceability must be provided with delivery of each part.  Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM to its current location.  If full and clear traceability is not provided, ALC will not accept delivery of the part and invoicing may not be approved for payment.

A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- <br />(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; <br />(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- <br />(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or <br />(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and <br />(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. <br />Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs <br />(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. <br />(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. <br />(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: <br />(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or <br />(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). <br />(2) Plan deemed in certain cases.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
(JUN 2006)
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). 
(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - PAST PERFORMANCE:<br />The offeror shall identify at least two (2) relevant (construction, overhaul, repair and alteration of ships) and current federal, state or local government or private contracts performed during the last three (3) years. For each contract, list:</p>
<p>a. Contract number and customer point of contact (including two (2) points of contact <br />With telephone numbers)<br />b. Dollar value of the contract (Original and Final)<br />c.

<p>If subcontracting arrangement is proposed, the above data must also be provided for each first tier subcontractor. If a joint effort or teaming arrangement is proposed, highlight previous experience with the proposed team or subcontractor.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will take into account the guidelines outlined at FAR 15.305(a)(2) Past Performance Evaluation. The Contractor's past performance will be evaluated according to the following factors and questions: <br />- Quality of Product or Service<br />Did the customer get what was specified?<br />Did the customer consider the final product high in quality?<br />If warranty issues arose, were they promptly corrected?<br />- Schedule<br />Was the contract completed on time? If not, reason why not (growth work, Contractor delayed, government delayed?)<br />- Business Relations<br />How was the customer service? Was the Contractor committed to customer satisfaction?<br />Would you use this company again (Why/Why not)?<br />- Management of Key Personnel<br />Were subcontracts involved? Comments?</p>
<p>In evaluating Contractors past performance, the government intends to also review U.S. Coast Guard Contractor Performance Assessment Reports and other existing past performance ratings on relevant contracts. General trends in a Contractor's performance will also be considered.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 - PRICE:</p>
<p>Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quotes. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>****Past Performance is significantly more important than Price****</p>

<p>FAR 52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data (OCT 2010) ALT IV <br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required<br />(b) If the contracting officer cannot determine price reasonableness either in the initial solicitation or in any change to the contract after award, the contracting officer will require submission information in sufficient detail in order to make such determination. <br />The information may be as follows: <br />REQUEST FOR INFORMAL COST BREAKDOWN<br />In addition to placing your offer in the appropriate place in Schedule of supplies and Prices, it is requested that you provide a breakdown of your costs, to include but not be limited to, those items identified in the sample format below:<br />Trade, (i.e. laborers, rigger, etc.)<br />Breakdown of labor grades by trade category<br />Manhours per trade, per labor grade<br />Cost/hour/trade<br />Supplies/materials (description &amp; cost of each)<br />Sub-total<br />Pension Plans<br />Overhead at a rate of ______%<br />Profit at a rate of ________%<br />Total for item _____________<br /><br />FAR 52.217-7 Option for Increased Quantity - Separately Priced Line Item (MAR 1989) - VARIATION <br />The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence, initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p>All waste generated under the performance of this contract shall be disposed under ISC Boston's EPA hazardous waste generator ID number. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) 24 hours prior to any waste removals, and ensure that waste removals are conducted during normal business hours (0800-1600) on Monday through Friday (excluding holidays).

The point of contact for environmental issues is the Environmental Protection Specialist at ISC Boston (617)223-3387.</p>
<p>(2) VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC) REGULATIONS</p>
<p>(a) Contractors are required to comply with federal, state and local VOC compliance laws and regulations. Among other requirements, certain Contractors may also be required to operate pursuant to a Title V permit. The need for such a permit will depend on the provisions of the applicable state's "State Implementation Plan" (SIP) and the type/quantity of the Contractor's regulated emissions, including VOCs. Certain SIPs may also mandate certain Contractors to operate under the terms of a compliance plan intended to reduce VOC emissions.</p>
<p>(b) Contractors, therefore, must submit the following to the designated Port Engineer not later than two weeks after contract award: <br />1) Copies of any federal, state or local permits required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places;<br />2) Copies of any compliance plans required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places.</p>

<p>(5) GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.<br /><br />(6) DISCOVERIES AND CHANGES TO CONTRACT:<br />Work requests can be transmitted electronically by using email.

<p>(7) COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>(8) MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT</p>
<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the Contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p>(10) CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard Surface Forces Logistic Center (SFLC) will monitor and evaluate the successful offeror's past performance of this contract and prepare a Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) in accordance with FAR Part 42.15.

The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule of Supplies/Services as follows:</p>
<p>A CLIN may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that CLIN have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each CLIN may be waived by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar CLINS.)</p>

<p>All payments for partial performance rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the Contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the Prime Contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The Contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend progress payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subcontract agreement.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified by the designated billing office and signed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as accurate and complete.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>FAR 52.212-2 QUOTES SHALL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - PAST PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The offeror shall identify at least two (2) relevant (construction, overhaul, repair and alteration of ships) and current federal, state or local government or private contracts performed during the last three (3) years. For each contract, list:</p>
<p>a. Contract number and customer point of contact (including two (2) points of contact <br />With telephone numbers)<br />b. Dollar value of the contract (Original and Final)<br />c. Type of service performed and whether Prime or subcontractor<br />d. Required completion date for the contract<br />e. Date the services were actually completed<br />f. Ship Name, Hull Number<br />g. Contract type (FFP, IDIQ, Requirement, Cost Type)<br />h. Percentage of growth in contract price (Additional work divided by award price)</p>
<p>If subcontracting arrangement is proposed, the above data must also be provided for each first tier subcontractor. If a joint effort or teaming arrangement is proposed, highlight previous experience with the proposed team or subcontractor.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will take into account the guidelines outlined at FAR 15.305(a)(2) Past Performance Evaluation. The Contractor's past performance will be evaluated according to the following factors and questions: <br />- Quality of Product or Service<br />Did the customer get what was specified?<br />Did the customer consider the final product high in quality?<br />If warranty issues arose, were they promptly corrected?<br />- Schedule<br />Was the contract completed on time? If not, reason why not (growth work, Contractor delayed, government delayed?)<br />- Business Relations<br />How was the customer service? Was the Contractor committed to customer satisfaction?<br />Would you use this company again (Why/Why not)?<br />- Management of Key Personnel<br />Were subcontracts involved? Comments?</p>
<p>In evaluating Contractors past performance, the government intends to also review U.S. Coast Guard Contractor Performance Assessment Reports and other existing past performance ratings on relevant contracts. General trends in a Contractor's performance will also be considered.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 - PRICE:</p>
<p>Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quotes. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>****Past Performance is significantly more important than Price****</p>
<p>Award may be made without any type of discussions or negotiations. This is based on the Contracting Officer's determination after an evaluation has been completed on all offers. <br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>FAR 52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data (OCT 2010) ALT IV <br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required<br />(b) If the contracting officer cannot determine price reasonableness either in the initial solicitation or in any change to the contract after award, the contracting officer will require submission information in sufficient detail in order to make such determination. <br />The information may be as follows: <br />REQUEST FOR INFORMAL COST BREAKDOWN<br />In addition to placing your offer in the appropriate place in Schedule of supplies and Prices, it is requested that you provide a breakdown of your costs, to include but not be limited to, those items identified in the sample format below:<br />Trade, (i.e. laborers, rigger, etc.)<br />Breakdown of labor grades by trade category<br />Manhours per trade, per labor grade<br />Cost/hour/trade<br />Supplies/materials (description &amp; cost of each)<br />Sub-total<br />Pension Plans<br />Overhead at a rate of ______%<br />Profit at a rate of ________%<br />Total for item _____________<br />FAR 52.217-7 Option for Increased Quantity - Separately Priced Line Item (MAR 1989) - VARIATION</p>
<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

Disposal of all hazardous wastes shall be performed by the Contractor and the Contractor shall meet all federal and state requirements. The Contractor is also required to submit an acceptable hazardous waste management plan to the Port Engineer at the Arrival Conference. The plan will be reviewed by the facility hazardous waste manager. An acceptable plan must address, at a minimum, the following requirements:<br />(a) EPA and local authority hazardous waste generator ID numbers or registration of the Contractors, his transporters, and disposal facilities (TSDFs);<br />(b) An inventory of all hazardous chemicals, compounds and other agents brought aboard the facility accompanied by their respective Material Safety Data Sheets;<br />(c) A list of all anticipated hazardous wastes to be generated and a federal/state/local regulation cross reference list for those wastes;<br />(d) Waste collection and containment procedures;<br />(e) A hazardous material spill and cleanup plan including tools and materials that will be on hand and readily available to facility containment and cleanup;<br />(f) Training certification for the Contractor's hazardous waste manager.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall note the local environmental regulations in Boston, and for Boston Harbor, are more stringent than in many jurisdictions. As with all environmental regulations, it is the Contractor's responsibility to research, prepare for, and comply with, the local and state regulations.</p>
<p>All waste generated under the performance of this contract shall be disposed under ISC Boston's EPA hazardous waste generator ID number. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) 24 hours prior to any waste removals, and ensure that waste removals are conducted during normal business hours (0800-1600) on Monday through Friday (excluding holidays).

The point of contact for environmental issues is the Environmental Protection Specialist at ISC Boston (617)223-3387.</p>
<p>(2) VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC) REGULATIONS</p>
<p>(a) Contractors are required to comply with federal, state and local VOC compliance laws and regulations. Among other requirements, certain Contractors may also be required to operate pursuant to a Title V permit.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), US Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112 , Washington, D.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

If internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest Procedures. (End of Provision) <BR> <BR>QUESTION:  There are several events scheduled that have either the tents requested or the chairs requested.  Wouldn't it make sense that on those days the requests would be for both items. ANSWER:  Some days the chairs are only needed for retirement ceremony (indoors) others are DA level ceremonies (outside). QUESTION:  Are there a specific type of chair that is prefered? ANSWER:  Chairs are not specific, only that they are all the same.  All equipment must  be in good working condition, free of tears, free of burns, free of stains, must be sturdy and safe for use. <BR> <BR>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>CANCELLATION NOTICE:This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.The solicitation number is 0040040308 and is issued as an invitation for bids (IFB), unless otherwise indicated herein.The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-60. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 332439 with a small business size standard of 500.00 employees.This requirement is a [ Small Business ] set-aside and only qualified offerors may submit bids.The solicitation pricing on www.FedBid.com will start on the date this solicitation is posted and will end on 2012-09-13 17:00:00.0 Eastern Time or as otherwise displayed at www.FedBid.com.FOB Destination shall be Dixon, CA 95620 <BR> <BR>The US Geological Survey requires the following items, Meet or Exceed, to the following:  <BR>LI 001, A Style container according to specs
Shipping must be FOB Destination only
See attached document for specifications and drawings, 2, EA; <BR>LI 002, B Style container according to specs. (3 units with doors on the left side, 2 units with doors on the right side)
Shipping must be FOB Destination only
See attached document for specifications and drawings, 5, EA; <BR>LI 003, Turbines, 14, EA; <BR>LI 004, louver Vent, 28, EA; <BR>LI 005, U-Hooks, hold approximately 500 lbs, 231, EA; <BR>LI 006, Side Swing Door, 5, EA; <BR>LI 007, Answers to questions from vendors:
The purpose of reposting this buy was to add the following answers to questions received by vendors.  The answers are as follows:
I am writing to inquire if these containers were required to be insulated or not? NO Also is there any requirement for lighting or power in the container? NO Additionally, I see point six of the spec states, "Each container should have two wind Turbines placed 10 ft from each end in the center of the container". Could you elaborate on this requirement? Are these for generating power...NO
Units are to be 40' long, with double swing door centered on the side. Louver vents are to be on the same side as the door. If placed every 10', one vent would be 10' from each end, and a third vent would fall center of the double swing doors. Not sure how you can get 4 vents, 10' apart, in a 40 foot span? Can you provide a photo of the unit that is being moved to this location for reference? SEE PHOTO, VENTS CAN BE PLACED ON EACH SIDE OF DOUBLE DOOR.
The unloading of the containers from the trucks will be done by the USGS.
The U Hooks also have to be on the inside on the container not the roof on the outside.
A zip file is attached with pictures to see what is needed., 1, EA; <BR> <BR><a href="https://marketplace.fedbid.com/fbweb/fbobuyDetails.do?token=%3D%3DwBKxmaVGYR9CAeqXk6uM7zQAAAAAHeAAgAgTFCGg%2FFzzqQbJAAyVXBA0Or">Solicitation and Buy Attachments </a> <BR> <BR>***Question Submission: Interested offerors must submit any questions concerning the solicitation at the earliest time possible to enable the Buyer to respond.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), US Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112 , Washington, D. C. 20593 -7112. Telephone (202) 372 3695.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), US Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112 , Washington, D. C. 20593 -7112. Telephone (202) 372 3695.

<p><br /><strong>Proposal Submission Place:<br /></strong>Ms. Reem Asaad<br />Data Center CEO and Corporate Secretary<br />Raya Holding for Technology and Communications S.A.E.<br />26th July St., Touristic Zone, 6th of October<br />12568 Cairo, Egypt<br />Tel : +202.3827.6000<br />Fax : +202.3827.6001<br />Email : <a href="mailto:reem_asaad@rayacorp.com">reem_asaad@rayacorp.com</a><br /><br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Raya Holding Data Center and Cloud Services Project.</p>
<p>Raya Holding was established in 1999 when seven leading Egyptian ICT companies merged to create the Middle East's largest ICT company. The 3,000-employee company has four main lines of business: IT services for business applications; call center services; distribution and retail of mobile phones and other consumer electronics; and smart building development. In addition, Raya Holding serves international markets, mostly in Saudi Arabia, the Gulf and the Levant, through its Raya International Services division. In 2008, Raya Holding inaugurated its first Raya Data Center facility, in partnership with Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, Cisco, Dell, and EMC, in the neighborhood known as the 6th of October City outside of Cairo. The facility, the only ISO/IEC 27001 certified data center provider in Egypt, spans over 350 m2 and offers a range of services from web servers to complex online applications, email solutions, security and storage services. Raya Holding is a Cisco Gold Certified Partner, a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, an Oracle Certified Advantage Partner, and a HP Preferred Gold Partner, serving as both a reseller and systems integrator for the partner companies.</p>
<p>In response to rapidly increasing demand, Raya Holding intends to expand its data center offerings with an estimated $20.4 million investment over three years to build a new 1,000 m2 data center that includes cloud service capabilities. A full spectrum of cloud services would be offered, including solutions for private cloud deployments; co-location and hosting services; traditional ICT managed services; public cloud services for enterprises; and offerings such as Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Raya Holding has taken several steps to support this new data center, including the creation in February 2012 of a new line of business called the Raya Data Center; the appointment of Ms. Reem Asaad as CEO for the new data center; and the allocation of approximately $1 million (EGP 6 million) from its 2012 budget for the purchase of land for the new data center. Raya Holding is currently evaluating land acquisition opportunities in the Cairo neighborhoods of New Cairo and Maadi.</p>
<p>To guide this major investment, Raya Holding requires a comprehensive analysis and feasibility study. The Study will combine technological, business and strategic planning as well as market analysis and specialized consultation on service definition and implementation planning. Specifically, the Study will: (1) research and analyze the data center and cloud services market demand in the Middle East and Africa; (2) develop a strategic plan for the data center based on an assessment of Raya Holding's current capabilities; (3) develop a business plan and vision for the data center, including risk analysis, long-term development options, financial forecasts and return on investment analysis; and (4) determine the fundamental design requirements, budget, implementation plan, and procurement package for the data center and (5) Cloud Strategy and its design, implementation plan, procurement package)</p>

Potential applicants are encouraged but not required to attend this meeting.</p>
<p><strong>SELECTION CRITERIA:</strong> The COE will be selected on the ability of the applicant to meet the following criteria mandated by Congress:<br />--The extent to which the needs of the State in which the applicant is located are representative of the needs of the region for improved air transportation services and facilities.<br />--The demonstrated research and extension resources available to the applicant for carrying out the intent of the legislation.<br />--The capability of the applicant to provide leadership in making national and regional contributions to the solution of both long-range and immediate air transportation problems.<br />--The extent to which the applicant has an established air transportation program.<br />--The demonstrated ability of the applicant to disseminate results of air transportation research and educational programs through a statewide or region-wide continuing education program.<br />--The research projects that the applicant proposes to carry out under the grant.<br />Specific projects will be defined, evaluated, and funded throughout the life of the Center.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking a contractor to provide SEC employees with a 24 hour online and telephonic centralized registration and placement service for child and elder care recipients. The SEC is not seeking a registry service. The SEC is seeking a professionally staffed center with care specialists who will minimize employee time and effort in obtaining care.

Care recipients include dependent child, "mildly-ill child" and elderly (adult) family members. Contactor shall establish a system for processing requests for backup child and elder care services from a comprehensive nation-wide network of licensed and qualified child care centers and in-home care providers. The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform backup child and elder care services.</p>
<p>This contract shall provide geographic flexibility, so that employees can choose centers and in-home providers either close to home or close to work as needed. Additionally, SEC employees travel to cities across the country on SEC business. The comprehensive network of licensed and qualified child care centers and in-home providers shall cover cities across the country so that family care will not be a burden when travel for work is necessary.</p>
<p>A comprehensive network shall consist of at least 5 qualified child care centers within a 25 mile radius of SEC offices and in-home adult and child care services available to each SEC location.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Government contemplates award of an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract with firm fixed priced backup child and elder care uses.A six month firm fixed price implementation period is also anticipated, which will include IT testing such as Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) as required by federal law in accordance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-37, using NIST SP 800-53 security controls. The period of performance for this contract will likely include a twelve-month base period, with four option years. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 624410 -- Child Day Care Services, with a small business size standard of $7,000,000 or less. This requirement is unrestricted, and only qualified offerors may submit proposals. <br /><br />The solicitation is to be released on or about October 15, 2012.

The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number.

When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>

The period of performance for this extension will be from 1 November through 30 November 2012. An appeal to the Court of Federal Claims challenging the award of the follow-on Minuteman Launch Support Services contract (FA4610-09-R-0013/FA4610-12-C-0001) was dismissed on 9 Oct 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 576th FLTS MLSS contract provides for a wide range of support services for Force Development Evaluation Minuteman Launches at Vandenberg AFB. Support services include, but are not limited to: launch facility refurbishment, corrosion control services, vehicle issue and control, management services, and training services which support critical mission requirements. The extension will provide for the continuation of uninterrupted services of the above services at Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) outlined above. This one month extension of services is pursuant to FAR 6.302-2(a)(2), Unusual and Compelling Urgency, as cited in 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(2) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This extension is needed to satisfy the requirements of the 576th Flight Test Squadron, Air Force Global Strike Command, to provide Minuteman Launch Support Services (MLSS) and will allow for a transition of services to a new contractor on 1 Dec 2012. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
