The purpose of this simplified acquisition is to provide drug pricing information for use by State Medicaid Agencies in reimbursing pharmacies for prescription drugs.

In addition to pricing, AWPs available through First Databank also has National Drug Code information, both of which are needed for a significant amount of audits to be preformed this year. One audit can require approximately 100 reports to be run using this product. In addition, Centers for Medicare Services (CMS) has adopted this product as the official guide to pricing for drugs related to the new Medicare Part D program that has gone into effect January 1, 2006.

In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b), the Government intends to solicit only one source. Interested concerns with the ability to provide identical or equivalent data files inclusive of current and historical average wholesale prices of all drugs on the market may identify their interest and submit a capability statement that demonstrates their ability to provide the products required. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE; therefore, requests for such documents will be considered invalid responses. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the APC 120V Smart UPS.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the APC 120V Smart UPS for use as a key component for overseas Consular staff offices.  The APC brand name is required because it is the only UPS that responds to and follows the commands of PowerChute, the software that Consular Affairs uses to generate start-up and shut-down scripts.  These scripts ensure that the database is protected. In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested APC 120V Smart UPS without delay so that the pilot testing required for the verification of field functionality can commence as scheduled.   The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system. The APC 120V Smart UPS has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>I recommend that the Department of State use other than full and open competition for the acquisition of the APC 230V Smart UPS.

<RESPDATE>040708
<ARCHDATE>05072008
<CONTACT>Vickie Gordon, 202-385-7010
<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI).  The responses to this market survey will be used for information purposes only.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR OFFER.  THIS IS NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR).  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. INTRODUCTION This RFI is the second announcement regarding the Alaska Flight Service Modernization (AFSM) Program. It follows an initial Market Survey conducted in 2006 that was based upon earlier strategies and a later implementation schedule. The purpose of this RFI is to post the Requirements Document and elicit specific information regarding potential commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions that will meet AFSM requirements.   Flight Services in Alaska are currently provided by government employees using a leased automation system called the Operational and Supportability Implementation System (OASIS).  OASIS was installed on an interim basis following the unscheduled decommissioning of the predecessor systems (DAWN/AAWBS/ M1FC). In addition to the automation system, this RFI addresses the replacement of the Alaska Voice Communications System presently used for radio and telephone communication at the three AFSSs in Alaska.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined that the best interest of the government will be served by replacing the OASIS and the voice system through a full and open competition. The FAA is especially interested in cost saving recommendations based on industry experience with previously developed flight service automation and voice systems. Of particular interest at this time are readily deployable systems. Based upon the findings of this RFI, the FAA plans to release either a draft SIR for Industry comment or a formal SIR for Industry response.  INDUSTRY DAY    To provide interested vendors an opportunity to learn more about the AFSM Program, the FAA plans to host an Industry Day at the FAA Headquarters, 800 Independence SW, Washington, DC.  The date for the Industry Day will be announced on the FAA Contracting Opportunities Website.   Industry Day will provide a forum for open discussion on the AFSM Program and give vendors an opportunity to ask questions about requirements, acquisition strategy, and other related issues.  Questions are not required in advance however, vendors may submit questions or topics for discussion not later than ten days prior to Industry Day to the Contracting Officer via email at Vickie.Gordon@faa.gov. Additionally, the FAA is willing to conduct one-on-one information meetings with interested vendors upon vendor request.  These meetings will be limited to 60 minutes and no more than five (5) representatives from each vendor may participate in the sessions with the AFSM Team. Note:  The one-on-one meetings are not mandatory, and are not being requested by the FAA.  The meetings are being offered because some potential offerors may be reluctant to ask questions or express their acquisition ideas in a public forum.  The FAA will not reveal or discuss information that has not been made available to all interested vendors.  No vendors should expect to gain a competitive advantage as a result of this alternative information exchange.  Vendors should request a one-on-one meeting only if absolutely necessary. All vendors planning to participate in Industry Day must submit a list of the names and titles of their company representatives to the FAA Contracting Officer not later than 12:00 noon Eastern Time 2 business days prior to the scheduled meeting.  Vendors with foreign national employees planning to attend should complete FAA Form 1600-78 "Request For Visit By Foreign National", and submit the form with the list of names.  The list of names and FAA Forms, if any, can be sent via email to Vickie Gordon at Vickie.Gordon@faa.gov.  In addition, any vendor desiring to participate in a one-on-one meeting with members of the FAA AFSM team must provide a company point of contact and the names of the individuals who will be representing their company at the meeting.  The FAA CO will provide each interested vendor with the location and time for the exclusive meeting. All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or costs incurred or relating to submissions in response to this Market Survey or Industry Day.   BACKGROUND  Alaska, with the highest per capita number of general aviation airplanes and pilots in the United States, is critically dependent on reliable, timely and accurate flight planning, weather and aeronautical information, and voice communications to promote air safety.  Air travel is the prime mode of transportation between locations within the state and the combination of many pilots and extreme flying conditions contributes to hazardous flying conditions. Alaskan pilots depend on the weather and flight planning information provided by Flight Services. Currently, flight services are provided through 17 facilities in Alaska. Hub facilities, known as Automated Flight Service Stations (AFSS), are located at Juneau, Kenai, and Fairbanks and fourteen (14) smaller, but functionally-identical, Flight Service Stations (FSSs) are located at strategic but less-populated areas in Alaska. Several of the FSSs are in remote locations where the only access is by air and some operate seasonally or part-time. The flight services workload varies throughout the year.   Alaska's rugged terrain and vast distances has limited development of Alaska's transportation and communications infrastructure.  Consequently the flight services system has a unique set of requirements. Principal among these is the need to overcome the limited availability of broadband communications within the state. To help deal with this issue the FAA emplaced the Alaskan National Airspace System (NAS) Interfacility Communications System (ANICS), now known as the Alaskan Satellite Telecommunications Infrastructure (ASTI).  ASTI routes data using two geostationary satellites, which provide high availability and path diversity, but still result in constrained bandwidth and propagation delays.   The following is a list of high level requirements for the Alaska Flight Service Modernization (AFSM) program: The system is to be operated and maintained by FAA employees, Services must be provided from the 17 existing facility locations, Equipment must fit within the confines of the existing buildings and floor space, Equipment must be operable on existing power sources, and The system must interface with existent FAA National Air Space (NAS) operational systems such as:  WMSCR, USNSR, NADIN-II, FTI, ASTI, etc.  STRATEGY The FAA plans to purchase a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) or a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) system to replace the current OASIS system. To replace the OASIS system, the FAA intends to conduct a Full and Open Competition Procurement and award a single contract for the AFSM automation system.  The initial phase of the automation contract will require sustainment of the current level of services.  The new system should be implemented and ready for operations no later than January 2010.  Any requirements that require software development may be phased in later during performance of the contract.   The degree of integration between the voice switch and the flight service automation system and whether the voice switch is included with the automation contract are dependent upon marketplace capabilities.  The FAA may or may not include the voice switch with the automation contract.  If the voice switch is not part of the automation contract, a second contract for the voice switch may be awarded at a later date.     INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDENTS This announcement is a Request for Information only. Interested vendors are invited to respond in accordance with the guidelines in the following sections. All responses become the property of the US Government, and will be kept in Government confidence  This IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) of any kind. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR OFFER.  THIS IS NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR).  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.   This IS NOT A TENDER DOCUMENT of any kind. The government assumes no obligation to purchase any goods or services described in responses to this RFI. This is NOT A DOWNSELECT of any kind, and none of the information submitted will disqualify vendors from subsequent consideration. Responses to this RFI will be used to validate marketplace capabilities and FAA flight service concepts.  TIMING AND FORM OF RESPONSES Responses must be in common electronic readable format (e.g., Microsoft Word, Excel, Visio, PowerPoint, etc.) and e-mailed (with confirmation receipt requested) to vickie.gordon@faa.gov and Barbara.jackson@faa.gov.  The vendor must complete FAA Form 1600-78 if applicable and the Business Declaration Form.  All responses must be received no later than April 7, 2008.  Printed (paper) responses are neither requested nor desired. All responses received by the FAA will be treated as Proprietary Information, unless otherwise requested by the individual submitter.  Proprietary information must be marked accordingly.  All costs incurred by a vendor in response to this Market Survey and Industry Day will be the sole responsibility of the vendor.  The FAA is not liable for any costs associated with responses to this announcement or Industry Day.     Interested vendors are invited to respond describing their respective capability to deliver a Non- Developmental Item (NDI) or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) system which, at a minimum, sustains current Alaska Flight Services level of service.  Responses to this market survey should identify which requirements in the Requirements Document can be met now and which requirements will require development.

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation and any resultant contract is to obtain services for one light, high-fixed-wing multi engine aircraft fully operated by qualified pilot and equipped to meet specifications for special use missions for support of the R6 Forest Health Program on Public and State Lands. During the Mandatory Availability Period (45 days) and any extensions thereof, the aircraft will be made available for the exclusive use of the Government.  It is anticipated that there will be between 100 and 140 flight hours.

The light fixed wing multi engine aircraft will be used as a platform for the government to complete insect and disease detection surveys in the states of Oregon and Washington and may also be used for other project, and administrative flights.  Work will be accomplished Monday through Friday.  It is anticipated that work will begin approximately the week of July 7th 2008.

OVERVIEW OF FOREST INSECTS AND DISEASES AERIAL SURVEY MISSION

(1)	Systematic aerial detection surveys have been conducted in the Pacific Northwest annually since 1947.  Approximately 45 million forested acres are surveyed each year throughout Oregon and Washington.  The Washington survey is conducted using a contract aircraft and pilot and covers approximately 20 million forested acres over all ownerships.

(2)	Two observers (government employees) on opposite sides of the aircraft look for and map ?tree damage? to a distance of two miles out.  Observers are looking for signs or symptoms (colors, patterns, timing, etc.) of current year mortality, defoliation, disease, and or weather damage.  Observations are recorded on a 1:100,000 USGS map or digitally on Government Furnished computers.  The majority of flights are conducted on a grid pattern.  The grid pattern employed in Washington involves flying parallel flight lines spaced four miles apart.  In this system of flying it is very important for the pilot to hold a precise heading (along section lines, lines of latitude or longitude) as determined by the lead observer.  Typically, the aircraft is flown at 100-120 mph, and 1,000 feet above ground level, but often ranges from between 500 and 2,000 feet AGL.  Mountain contouring and ridge flying are other techniques used in more deeply dissected terrain such as the Olympic and North Cascade Mountains.

<DESC>FDA seeks to continue to access drug utilization data in an outpatient setting at the national level in the US. The ability of FDA to respond expeditiously to the increasing number of postmarketing issues is of paramount importance to the overall public safety.  Continued access to these data complement and strengthen the utility of the passive reporting system currently in place by providing estimates of the numbers of patients exposed to drugs and the numbers of prescriptions dispensed nationwide in the outpatient setting.  These data provide a denominator, or context, for understanding adverse event reports; for modeling drug risk based on usage patterns; and for calculating patient-based reporting rates for drugs used in the outpatient setting.  Access to these data also increase the FDA's ability to perform regulatory impact studies; in particular, those studies that assess the impact of risk managements plans and labeling changes on prescribing habits and usage patterns for prescription drugs.  Finally, direct access to these data in real time enhances and accelerates the pace of FDA's regulatory decision-making process.

The "Access to Outpatient Prescription and Patient Level Drug Utilization Data" contract would serve as a mechanism for FDA to respond expeditiously to serious public health or regulatory issues.  FDA is not interested in developing this database and expects any qualified organization to own the data as well as have the means to access and manage the data. 

The government anticipated the award of a fixed price contract with one 12-month base year and three 1-year option periods.  The contract shall also contain an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity line item for related services on a fixed price or time-and-materials basis.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane intends to enter into an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with GE Aviation Systems 14100 Roosevelt Blvd, Clearwater, FL with a ceiling amount of $9,300,000.00.

Procurements under the IDIQ will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary nature of the technical data for the system resulting in a lack of drawings and specifications, in addition to duplicative costs and time that would be required to reverse engineer the system.  This is a ?follow on? contract of a previous IDIQ contract that was awarded in 2005 to Smith Aerospace, who was acquired by GE Aviation.  Numbered Note 22 applies.   All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date, 28 May 2008, will be posted to Crane web site, FedBizOpps, and NECO.  It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor the Crane web site, FedBizOpps and/or NECO for any additional amendments that may be issued.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River plans to conduct a full and open competition to procure airborne equipment demonstration support for Science and Technology (S&T) sensor development programs at NAVAIR.  NAVAIR is developing a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) sensor called Claymore Marine (CM) and a passive, non-acoustic ASW system called the Joint Multi Mission Electro-optical System (JMMES).  These systems are in the technology development phase and need to be test flown over land and ocean areas of interest in order to de-bug and validate the operation of the systems prior to potential transition to an acquisition program.  The contractor shall provide integration of sensor payloads and support equipment racks onto a contractor test bed aircraft, fuel, airport fees (hanger and ramp space), and flight support for NAVAIR test articles.  The payloads will consist of a Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) Claymore Marine laser system mounted amidship with a belly window, and a GFE JMMES system which includes a WESCAM MX-15 or MX-20 system mounted in a turret near the aircraft nose, plus supporting instrumentation, installed in 19 inch racks provided by the Government.  The contractor shall provide for simultaneous carriage and use of laser, and the MX-15/20 systems.  Aircraft integration shall include structural preparation and certification of the aircraft to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations with test payloads installed.  These test demonstrations will be conducted primarily in CONUS, but there may be foreign deployments.  Test demonstrations will include installation and flight certification of the (GFE) systems, as well as providing Test Planning support.  The contractor's aircraft must have radar with surface search capability in order to insure that shipping traffic is not over flown with the LIDAR transmitting.  The aircraft must be able to operate with either system uninstalled.  Flights will be conducted both independently and in conjunction with Fleet exercises.  Flights will be at low altitude, with the majority at night in clear weather.  

The required specifications include, but are not limited to:

a.	Carriage of a 900 lb payload consisting of a nadir (belly mounted) LIDAR looking through a floor mounted optical window, an optical MX-15/20 turret and supporting instrumentation, and recorders mounted in (3) 19 inch racks.  Racks to be provided by the contractor.  Optionally, the government may supply suitable racks as needed.  The Government racks will meet FAA requirements.  The outside dimensions are:  48.25 inches tall (without feet) x 22.5 inches wide x 23 inches deep.  Contractor shall install the equipment racks into the aircraft and make all cables and equipment connections as required.

b.	Provisions for at least 4 Government supplied payload operators in the aircraft cabin.  Provisions include: operator stations; approved takeoff, landing, and emergency seating,  and extended over water emergency equipment;

c.	A belly laser well with minimum dimensions of 21.75 inch diameter with an optical window mounted in it;

d.	Ability to fly for a duration of 5 hours with full crew and payload;

e.	Radar with a sea surface search mode capable of detecting marine traffic at a distance sufficient to provide time to allow the pilot time to deactivate the laser transmitter via an installed pilot pickle switch;

f.	Speed of 85 to 90 Knots at 500 foot altitude for mission testing;

g.	UHF, VHF Marine, and HF radios must be installed for use by the operators and flight crew.

A previous buy for similar requirements were competitively awarded in accordance with FAR 13.5 and FAR 12.  The award was made in FY 08 to Aviation Systems Engineering Company Inc., Lexington Park, MD.  This new requirement has been expanded beyond the previous buy to provide more test opportunities and locations over a longer period of performance.  It is the Government's intent to award a single Performance Based Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with Cost Plus Fixed Fee and Cost Reimbursement line items to the offeror who provides the best value utilizing source selection approaches.  The task ordering period is five (5) years.  Participation in this acquisition is unrestricted.  The solicitation will include the maximum opportunity for small business concerns participation of at least 30% of the total proposed contract value subcontracted to small business concerns.  Should this solicitation result in award to a large business, a subcontracting plan is required prior to award.

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) has submitted to the NATO Infrastructure Committee a request for authorization to implement an Air Command and Control Information Services (AirC2IS) project. 

The AirC2IS project is currently in the system requirement, capture, and specification stage. The NC3A shall endeavor, with the participation of industry and representatives from the Strategic Commands and the NATO Air Command and Control Management Agency (NACMA), to gather information on National Air C2 technology, capabilities, and systems, in order to construct a comprehensive specification of the NATO Air C2IS functional requirements.

In order to optimize this exercise, NC3A is organizing an Air C2IS Industry Workshop on 28-29 April 2008 in Brussels, Belgium. To assist companies participating in the Industry Workshop, an Information Day will be held at NC3A in Brussels on 08 April 2008.

With the Industry Workshop, NC3A intends to benefit from industry expertise and experience and to collect information about lessons learned and experience gained during recent implementation of similar projects. The information collected as a result of this Workshop will be used to further develop and improve the Request for Bidders Views that will be issued after the project has been authorized and the results of the Workshop assessed.

Participation in this Workshop entails presenting recent and relevant experience and lesions learned regarding the implementation of projects of similar scope and complexity as the Air C2IS.

The Workshop is not directly tied to any future solicitations under this project. The main objective of the Workshop is to ensure that valuable industrial experience regarding the implementation of similar projects is taken into account for the sake of effectiveness.

This announcement is not a Notification of Intent to call for bids. Furthermore, any company that is not interested in taking part in the proposed Information Day will not be prevented from taking part in the subsequent competitive bidding process, if declared eligible to do so by its government. 

INFORMATION DAY

The Air C2IS Information Day on 08 April is intended to provide details to industry on the specific objectives of the Workshop as well as logistics information. Industry is advised to attend this Information Day if they plan to participate in the Workshop.

To register for the Air C2IS Information Day, send an email to Ms. Anna Kapnoula (anna.kapnoula@nc3a.nato.int) and Ms. Lise Vieux-Rochat (lise.vieux-rochat@nc3a.nato.int) 

Registration must be completed before 31 March 2008. Participation at the Information Day is limited to two participants per company.

INDUSTRY WORKSHOP

The Air C2IS Industry Workshop will be held at the Holiday Inn at Holidaystraat 7, 1831 Diegem, Belgium on 28-29 April 2008.

The Workshop will offer each company that registers a 45-minute session during which it can privately brief NC3A staff and the Bi-SC Air C2 Operator User Group (OUG) on the experience with Air C2 technology, capabilities, and systems that are relevant to the NATO Air C2IS.

There will also be an opportunity to present and/or demonstrate to NC3A and the AirC2 OUG, in a convention-style forum, National Air C2 prototypes and systems. 

NC3A has an Air CSIS Workshop registration site where all bookings must be made:
http://www.rsvpbook.com/event.php?461308  Registration must be completed before 31 March.

Each registered company will be assigned a timeslot for their presentation. Please note that the private presentations or demonstrations during the Workshop are limited to two representatives from each company.

NC3A requests that companies interested in participating in the Workshop submit to the NC3A points of contact a technical description of their Air C2 technology, capability, or systems prior to the Information Day.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), has a requirement for the Division of Intramural Research (DIR) Mouse Phenotyping Core Laboratory for the purchase of a Blood Pressure Biopotential, and Activity Measurement Systems/Transmitters, as outline below.  This particular system is designed strictly for use in mice. In previous experiment the NHLBI investigators have used these transmitters for past research projects and a change in transmitter and system type would introduce an unacceptable variable.  Follow on or new studies would require repeating studies to establish new baseline data and would unacceptably increase the number of animals that must be used. The planned experiments are to be conducted in transgenic and knockout mice so the smaller sized transmitter is the critical specification. Furthermore, transmitters purchased in the past can be used in conjunction with the new equipment.The requirement is under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, Size Standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP No. NIMH-08-DN-00018) entitled Preparation of Developing Brain Tissue from Rhesus macaque for Gene Expression Analysis, on or about March 25, 2008, under full and open competitive procedures. 

As the lead institute for this NIH Blueprint project, NIMH is seeking organizations and investigators with access to appropriate colonies of Rhesus macaque primates, and with expertise in extracting anatomically defined brain regions from non-human primates (Maccaca mulatta) at different developmental stages that range from pre-natal to adult. This project will involve collecting tissue from estimated 4-6 brain regions, from 4-6 animals, at 5 different developmental time points over the course of two years. There will be options to extend the contract beyond 2 years, which would require additional tissue samples. The facility/investigator must have access to animals that come from well-defined colonies with the following characteristics/data available: 1) the lineage and hierarchical status of each animal is characterized in detail; 2) the exact date of birth of the animals is documented; 3) animals are nursery reared; 4) the animals are raised in naturalistic group settings (i.e., free-ranging colonies in large outdoor corrals, housed to allow for normal social interactions); and 5) the animals kept at institutions with a currently approved DHHS Animal Welfare Assurance. IACUC approval will be mandatory for this project prior award of the contract.

In addition to access to appropriate animals, capable sources/investigators must have the following documented experience and capabilities: 1) expertise in Rhesus macaque neuroanatomy; 2) expertise in the dissection and blocking of tissue from specific brain regions in Rhesus macaque primates; 3) expertise in the preparation of tissue for in situ hybridization analysis and Nissl staining (note: these will be performed at a separate facility); and 4) expertise in the shipping/transportation of biohazardous materials to another facility for further processing. This contract will be the sole supplier of brain samples to another contractor for processing, and will be required to work effectively and closely with the other facility.

RFP No. NIMH-08-DN-00018 will be available on or about March 25, 2008 with the receipt date of proposals on or about May 23, 2008. The RFP may be accessed through the following site: Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fbo.gov/). Please note that the RFP for this requirement will include the Statement of Work, Deliverables, and Reporting Requirements, the Technical Evaluation Criteria, and proposal preparation instructions. All information required for the submission of an offeror will be contained in the electronic RFP package. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal that will be considered by the NIMH. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. Please contact Bruce Anderson, NIMH Contracting Officer, at 301-443-2234 or ba9i@nih.gov for further information.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services to design and conduct projects that will improve access to HIV/AIDS related health information by patients, caregivers, the affected community and the general public. Emphasis is on providing information or access to health and medical information in a way meaningful to the target community, and increasing the awareness and utilization of NLM online health and medical resources in the HIV/AIDS Community. 

Projects must involve one or more of the following information access categories:
1. Information Retrieval: To provide or improve access to electronic AIDS- and other health-related information resources by the organization or by the clients they serve and to implement access to state-of-the-art AIDS-related information tools via the Internet. This may require the purchase of hardware (computer equipment), software, or contractual relationships necessary to obtain a connection to the Internet for the purpose of accessing AIDS-related information or sharing AIDS-related information; 2. Skills Development: Training to develop skills in accessing or using HIV/AIDS-related information including the use of online databases and general AIDS information resources in order to improve services and benefit the community. This may include training for the staff of the agency providing HIV/AIDS services, development of training programs for clients and patrons, etc.;  3. Resource Development: To support an organization to meet the needs of their clients or communities by developing specific educational or informational materials such as culturally or language specific fact sheets, bibliographies, guides or other products; and/or 4.Document Access: Access to HIV/AIDS-related documents and other types of health information. This may include the development of connections with local health sciences libraries to obtain use of their collections, to procure interlibrary loan services, etc.

NLM is particularly interested in involving the affected community in the development of these new programs. Emphasis will be placed upon small businesses and the following types of organizations or arrangements for developing these programs:
1. Community-based organizations (CBO) or patient advocacy groups currently providing AIDS-related services to the affected community. This encompasses both individual groups wishing to enhance their own services, as well as several cooperating for the purpose of this project; 2. Public Libraries wishing to serve their communities in the provision of AIDS-related information and resources;3. Health departments or other local, municipal, or state agencies working to improve the public health;4. Faith-based organizations currently providing AIDS-related services to the affected community; and/or 5. Multi-type consortia of the above listed organizations that may be in existence or formed specifically for this project. This consortium should include at least one of the groups listed above in the management of the project, but may include other types of agencies, such as health sciences libraries, that may be able to provide expertise and resources for the project. Where necessary, formation of consortia for the purpose of carrying out an NLM-supported project is strongly encouraged.

The Government anticipates that multiple fixed-priced type purchase orders will be awarded for a base period of two (2) years. The period of performance is anticipated to begin on or about September 30, 2008. The applicable NAICS Code is 624190 and the small business size standard is $6.5 mil.

<DESC>FISC Norfolk Contracting Department Philadelphia Office intends to procure on a sole source basis the continuation of HIV testing Services in support of the Department of the Navy under contract N00140-03-D-N800 with Viromed Laboratories of Eden Prairie, MN.  Continuation of the required HIV testing services is needed in order to ensure no lapse in contractual coverage until resolution of a request for reconsideration relating to a GAO protest ruling issued under competitive, follow-on solicitation N00189-07-R-Z027.  The required HIV testing services include, but are not limited to, initial screening for HIV using an FDA-licensed Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) test derived from whole viral lysate or a combination whole viral lysate and recombinant proteins.  Specimens found repeatedly reactive by screening ELISA shall be retested utilizing an FDA-licensed Western Blot (WB) technique to confirm reactivity with HIV specific viral polypeptide.  On a case-by-case basis, the Contractor shall perform additional retroviral assays, and/or tests of a molecular level to confirm positivity.  The Navy estimates submitting approximately 60,000 to 70,000 specimens per month for initial HIV-1 ELISA screening from approximately 1300 submitting activities (SA), of which not more than one (1) percent will require confirmatory or supplemental testing.  The period of performance for the resultant extension will consist of a four month base, commencing 01 April 2008  through 31 July 2008, plus two (2) additional one-month option periods to extend the term of the resultant contract through no later than 30 September 2008, if all options are exercised.  Issuance of a Firm Fixed Price contract extension modification is anticipated. The proposed contract action is for services which the Government intends to solicit and with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Numbered note 22 applies.  The applicable NAICS and size standard are 621511 and $12.5 Million respectively.

<DESC>The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with CGI Federal, Inc. for additional services which are currently being provided under an existing contract (Examiner Workstation or "xWorks", Contract OFHEO-2005-01C).  xWorks is based on Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS)  technology that has been customized as necessary to meet and provide the business process functional requirements and needs of OFHEO.  It automates the preparation, review, centralized storage, and retrieval of documentation generated by and associated with OFHEO's supervisory process of the two Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs)--the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).  This synopsis is required because the additional services are outside the scope of the existing contract based on the current dollar value of the contract.  However, the additional services are required because OFHEO has ongoing requirements while working on recompeting the current contract and there needs to be an allowance for a transition period if the successor should be a new contractor.    The additional services include:  1) streamlining the process of using OFHEO's software tool, MKS, for configuration management; 2) updating some of the existing documentation and tutorials to capture the most recent changes to the system; 3) assessing the portal views to identify any changes to the current vision; 4) assessing the functionality to identify any changes to the current vision; and 5) earned value management on the aforementioned work.  CGI Federal, Inc. is the only contractor with the expertise to provide these services in a time-effective manner, has the current expertise on the existing system, and at a cost that is reasonable to the effort required.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of satisfying OFHEO's requirements may submit a written capabilities statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses must be submitted in writing to Ms. Janice L. Uthe, Contracting Officer, at janice.uthe@ofheo.gov.  A determination not to compete the requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

MacDill AFB is located approximately eight miles south of downtown Tampa on the tip of the Interbay Peninsula in Hillsborough County, Florida.  The base is surrounded by Tampa Bay on the south and west; by Hillsborough Bay on the east, and by the city of Tampa on the north.  The base covers about 5,630 acres of land and has an approximate population of 5,322 active duty and 1,077 civilian personnel.  Based upon present real estate records, MacDill AFB provides operations and maintenance support for approximately 480 separate facilities, excluding Military Family Housing.  This includes approximately 67 administration facilities, 16 dormitories, and 10 Temporary Lodging Facilities.  The remaining facilities are considered commercial or industrial use facilities and range from small shop spaces to large maintenance hangars.

Natural Gas:  TECO Peoples Gas supplies natural gas to the base.  A single eight-inch pipeline provides gas service for the entire base.  Service is provided to the base at a pressure of 10 pounds per square inch guage.  All equipment downstream of the manifold is owned, operated and maintained by MacDill AFB personnel.  The on-base distribution system consists of approximately 78,350 linear feet of underground piping; 65% PE and 35% steel, with 99% of it being installed in the 1970's.  There are approximately 445 valves ranging in size from 0.75 to 8 inches; 33 meters ranging in size from 1.25 to 8 inches; and 239, 1.25 inch regulators.  The majority of the pipe and valves were installed in the 1970's and the meters and regulators were installed in 1941.

Potable Water: MacDill AFB purchases all its potable water from the City of Tampa.

Tyndall AFB is located in Bay County near Panama City in northwestern Florida.  The main base and ancillary sites cover about 29,000 acres of land.  The property is situated on a peninsula and is connected to the Panama City community area via the Dupont Bridge.  Tyndall AFB is similar in scale to a small community.  There are approximately 1,262 facilities consisting of administration, commercial, schools and training, hospital and clinics, recreational, airfield support, fire protection, and transient living that total 5,288,749 square feet.  In addition, there are six distinct housing areas containing single and multi-family units.  Tyndall AFB supports approximately 4,400 military, 2,000 civilian, 1,510 contractor, and 3,400 personnel.  

Electricity:  Tyndall AFB purchases electricity from the Gulf Power Company.  The power is delivered through a Gulf Power-owned substation (Bldg 1238) on the west end of the Base near the hospital.  Power enters the substation via two 46kV lines and each of the two 46kV lines feed two 20 MVA transformers.  At the transformers the voltage is stepped down to the 12.47 kV distribution level.  The distribution system consists of approximately 794,115 single conductor linear feet (SCLF) of overhead primary circuits (1950's), 1,394,094 SCLF of overhead secondary circuits (1980's), 45,682 SCLF of underground primary circuits (1950's), and 77,937 SCLF of underground secondary circuits (1970's).  Also included are approximately 2,080 utility poles, 55 concrete manholes, 1,065 lightning arrestors, 199 meters, 42 single phase transformers ranging from 15 to 150 kVA, and 141 three-phase transformers ranging from 45 to 2500 kVA.  

Natural Gas:  Natural gas is delivered to the base via Florida Gas Transmission pipelines with local transmission by TECO Peoples Gas.  A single six-inch pipeline enters the base near the south side of the Dupont Bridge across the bay from Panama City and provides gas service for the entire base.  Service is supplied to the base at a pressure of 120 pounds per square inch gauge (psig), and distributed at approximately 55 psig.  The gas main passes through a regulator and valve station at the south end of the Dupont Bridge and all equipment after the regulator is owned, operated and maintained by Tyndall, AFB.  The on-base distribution system consists of approximately 170,104 linear feet of underground piping; 27% PE and 73% steel.  The PE pipe was installed in 1994 or 2002 and the steel pipe was installed in 1959.  There are approximately 240 valves ranging in size from 0.75 to 6 inches; 55 meters ranging in size from 1.25 to 4 inches; and 178, 1.00 inch regulators.  The majority of the valves were installed in 1959; 17 were installed in 2002.  All regulators and all but 4 meters were installed in 1974.  The remaining 4 meters were installed in 1959. 

Potable Water: Tyndall AFB normally purchases all potable water for the main base complex from Bay County Utilities Department (Bay County).  In addition, there are six remote on-base sites that utilize their own wells.  Water from Bay County enters at the Dupont Bridge, utilizing a single pipeline that feeds into the Bay County 5,000,000 gallon storage tank located northeast of Tyndall school across US Hwy 98.  The Bay County pump station then pumps to three distribution points along US Highway 98 that supply the Tyndall AFB distribution system.  Delivered water pressure averages about 70 psig and pressures on base range from 50 to 55 psig.  Tyndall AFB has no operational water treatment facilities for the main base complex.  The six remote on-base sites with well water systems are: Silver Flag; Wright Laboratories; Full-Scale Drone; Sub-Scale Drone; Alert Area; and Ammo Area.  Each site has one well, and the wells are permitted by the NWFWMA.  Chlorination is provided by a chlorine gas system at Silver Flag, and by a hypochlorite feed system at each of the other five sites.  The main base distribution system consists of approximately 418,131 linear feet of pipe ranging from 0.75 to 16 inches; 78% of the pipe was installed prior to 1960.  There are approximately 900 backflow preventers (1959 vintage), 867 valves ranging from .075 to 16 inches (68% installed prior to 1960), 280 hydrants (61% installed prior to 1960), two 250,000-gallon storage tanks (1943), one 150,000-gallon storage tank (1958), 23 supply meters, and 12 secondary meters.   

Wastewater: Tyndall AFB sends its wastewater to the Bay County Advanced Wastewater Treatment Facility located north of Tyndall AFB.  The Tyndall wastewater system must be maintained IAW the sewage treatment provisions of the contract between the Government and the Bay County Utilities Department.  Wastewater from the main Base and from the City of Mexico Beach is collected and pumped into the primary wet well at the old-Wastewater Treatment Plant (old-WWTP).  Although the old-WWTP is non-operational for treatment, select components are used to collect and pump wastewater to the Bay County Plant.  Alternatively, wastewater from the housing areas is collected through lift station facility 2873 and pumped directly to the Bay County Plant.  The wastewater distribution system contains approximately 484,032 linear feet of pipe ranging from 2 to 18 inches; 64% of the pipe was installed prior to 1960.  The distribution system also contains 172 pumps (22 were installed prior to 1980), 604 brick manholes (pre-1970), 212 precast manholes (post-1970), the old-WWTP, and the Silver Flag WWTP.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>James Ensign, 414-944-8466
<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the waste water distribution system for the Wisconsin Air National Guard (ANG) located at General Mitchell Internati onal Airport Wisconsin, to Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District for 128th ARS.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. T he Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems and will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will  require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuo us, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable  condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The waste water system being privatized is described as follows: The Wisconsin Air National Guard (ANG) 128 th Air Refueling Wing (ARW) is located about 6.5 miles south of the center of Milwaukee and 2.5 miles west of Lake Michigan.  The 128th ARWs mission is to provide aerial in-flight refueling and passenger/cargo transportation.  The base currently flies KC- 135 Air Refueling Tankers. <BR>The 128th ARW employs 980 Air Guard personnel, 294 technicians, and 39 civilians.  The base maintains approximately 26 buildings and structures with the breakdown being 16 industrial and 10 administrative buildings.  The Wisc onsin Air National Guard was established in 1947 and located at Mitchell Field. The 128th ARW occupies 63.4 acres leased from the State of Wisconsin.  The larger parcel, 58.5 acres is located east of the General Mitchell International Airport north-south r unway.  It houses the apron, hangars, and most of the base operation buildings.  The smaller parcel, 4.9 acres, is located to the west of the General Mitchell International Airport north-south runway, and is adjacent to the north side of the 440th Air Forc e Reserve Station.  The smaller parcel of land is referred to as the Guard West and it houses an office building and a maintenance facility.  Additional land adjacent to the east side of the base has been acquired to allow expansion in the future.  This la nd is currently undeveloped and separated from the main portion of the base by a large railroad embankment. Wastewater collected at the 128th ARW is conveyed to the City of Cudahys sewer collection system at a city owned manhole.  Wastewater is not metere d prior to entering the Cudahy sanitary sewer system; instead the installation is billed for sewage treatment fee based upon 100 percent of its potable water consumption.   The 128th ARW wastewater system consists primarily of gravity-flow pipe with three lift stations.  The collection system includes laterals, oil/water separators, and collection mains.  The oil/water separators treat industrial wastes before it enters the sanitary sewer system but are not part of this contract.  Several laterals are typic ally 4 to 6-inches in diameter, and mains range from 6 to 8-inches in diameter.  The average depth of the lines are 5 to 10 feet underground although the actual depth may vary. Most of the system consists of the original vitrified clay pipe installed in th e early 1960s.  The installation has two lift stations at the main base. The main pneumatic lift station is located near the intersection of Freedom Drive and T anker Avenue.  The discharge from this lift station flows to the city of Cudahy manhole located on the east side of the north-south railroad embankment, due east of the lift station.  The second lift station, a small grinder type, is located at the gate ho use at the north end of the main base.  It lifts wastewater from a small storage tank so its gravity flows to the main lift station.   The Guard West area contains a pneumatic lift station similar to the one on the main base.  The lift station discharges w astewater through a 6-inch pipe extending to the collection system at the former 440th AW near the fire training Pit.  The Air Force Real Property Agency assumes ownership of the wastewater when it enters the former 440th owned manhole.  Competitive propos als were requested in 2003 and no offers were received.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authorit y of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purch asing the distribution system, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such  systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Governm ent not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procur ement.<BR><BR>Interested sources shall contact SMSGT James Ensign, 1919 E Grange Avenue, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53207<BR>Original Point of Contact<BR>MSGT Steve Maier, steven.maier@wimilw.ang.af.mil. <BR>Places of Performance	<BR>            Location: 128th ARW, Air National Guard Station, Milwaukee, Wisconsin Country:    USA<BR>

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/DO requires the renewal of support and maintenance for Remedy software. The annual renewal of BMC Remedy software maintenance for Overseas Systems Support provides an upgrade path from version 6 to the currently available version 7. This upgrade is free to those customers that have purchased the maintenance and is needed by CA to provide a sufficient number of Remedy server licenses for combining the domestic and overseas help desk in the near future. The value enhancement of a development environment is the ability to leverage additional features and functionality of the BMC Remedy product line. Additionally, the environment can be torn down and rebuilt with an exact replica of production environment resources at any time without affecting the production environment resources at any time without affecting the productions environment. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system.<BR><BR>Support Contract Number: 9809<BR><BR>Period of Performance for all line items is Dec-01-2007 through NOV-30-2008.<BR><BR>

Local sources that are physically located in the Philippines and authorized (i.e. registered and licensed) to do construction work in the Philippines will be contracted by the prime contractor to perform the construction work specified in this solicitation.  Project design work for BIPS is expected to be carried out internally by the Prime?s staff. Except in rate circumstances, project design work for RIPS is expected to be subcontracted to local architect-engineering (A&E) firms.

Revealing the budgetary magnitudes for the contract and option does not mean that offerors should necessarily strive to meet the maximum amounts.  The most cost effective approach for achieving the results is encouraged and award will be made to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the Government considering technical and cost factors (see Section M of this solicitation).

Subject: 	Pre-solicitation Notice #623-KE-08-003, entitled "Draft Requirement of the Pharma Project in Kenya"

Dear Interested parties,
This is to inform you that USAID has released the draft statement of work for the "USAID Pharma Project" for your close review and considered comment. Comment must be provided no later than Tuesday, October 23, 2007, 4:30 pm, (Kenya time) via email to codonnell@usaid.gov, pmuthee@usaid.gov and cafrica@usaid.gov.

The draft statement of work may be found at http://www.usaid/gov/ke/ under "Business and Procurement" sublink or sent via email by the above named individuals upon request. In summary the purpose of the pending requirement is to establish and operate a safe, secure, reliable, and sustainable supply-chain management system to forecast, procure, store, and distribute the drugs, supplies, and equipment needed to provide care and treatment of persons with HIV/AIDS in Kenya. At the moment, USAID foresees that the contract requirement will not entail actually procuring laboratory materials and equipment such as rapid test kits, reagents or machines. 

A lesser but equally important component of the Pharma Project will be to build the capacity of Kenyan institutions and personnel in supply chain management in order to ensure the effectiveness, quality and sustainability of HIV/AIDS interventions.

The anticipated ceiling price is over $500,000,000.00 over a maximum 5 year period of performance.

USAID plans to hold a Pre-solicitation Conference in Nairobi, Kenya on or about November 6, 2007. Details of the conference and the registration process will be communicated through an Amendment to this Pre-solicitation Notice. The complete RFP in draft form should be released no later than October 31, 2007, prior to the planned pre-solicitation conference. 

Sincerely,
Christopher D. O?Donnell
Regional Contracting Officer

<DESC>PLEASE NOTE:  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS A DUPLICATE OF SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE NUMBER CMS-2008-FISMA-SOURCESOUGHT(2).  THE REASON FOR THIS DUPLICATION IS TO CHANGE THE NAICS CODE FROM 541990 TO 541519.

IN ADDITION, PLEASE SUBMIT QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES TO THE SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE BY E-MAIL TO THE INDIVIDUALS LISTED AS THE POINT OF CONTACT.  

THE RESPONSE DATE HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY CLOSE OF BUSINESS, ON MARCH 28, 2008.  ALL OTHER ITEMS REMAIN THE SAME.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (SS) NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide an IT Security Audit of an organization/facility that will determine if that organization is in compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).  The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002, outlines requirements to secure Federal information.  Each Federal Agency, including contractors or other organizations who work with the agency, must develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program.  The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) provides detailed guidance and recommendations for FISMA compliance. The National Institute for Standards and Technology guidelines encompass all aspects of information security.

Sources Sought are also required to have technical and professional understanding of requires listed in this sources sought.

In addition, to submitting a response to the Sources Sought, businesses can voluntarily?  Register as Interested Vendor?  On the Federal Business Opportunities website in order to promote teaming and/or prime and subcontractor relationships.

History:

The Standard Data Processing System (SDPS) consists of many data and reporting requirements that have been designed and developed in response to the ongoing ADP requirements of the various QIOs and other affiliated partners, such as the Clinical Data Abstraction Center (CDAC) to fulfill its contractual requirements with CMS.  This system, which became operational is May 1997, interfaces with CMS Central Office, 53 QIOs and CDAC.  Through the SDPS, the QIOs have a database of current Part A claims data, ad-hoc capability to access Part B data, access to national data sets, software tools for data analysis, report generation tools, and project information.

The Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) are critical elements of the SDPS project within QualityNet.  The SDPS is administrated by CMS, and is designed to monitor and improve utilization and quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries.  The QIO network infrastructure is comprised of a national network of fifty-three (53) QIOs responsible for each U.S. state, territory, and the District of Columbia.  Each QIO maintains a staff of mutli-disciplinary experts in medicine, quality improvement, health information management, IT Systems Security, Statistical analysis, computer programming and operations, communications, public relations, and clerical/administrative support.  The QIO network structures are configured identically with Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and are managed and supported by CMS IT support contractors.

Historically, the QIO organizations were exempt from meeting the FISMA standards.  But, with the increasing threat to Identity Theft and the OMB mandates to strengthen the security posture of the Federal Information Systems that contain sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII), CMS can no longer accept the risk.  The QIO organizations must now move towards FISMA compliance.

The goal is to quantify and document the existing security posture of the QIO organizations from a FISMA compliance standpoint.

BACKGROUND
________________________________________________________________
Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA): 
http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/m03-19.pdf 

The ability to provide an IT Security Audit of an organization/facility that will determine if that organization is in compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002, outlines requirements to secure Federal information. Each Federal Agency, including contractors or other organizations who work with the agency, must develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program. The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) provides detailed guidance and recommendations for FISMA compliance. NIST guidelines encompass all aspects of information security.

FISMA sections 3544 and 3505 require the following: 

Compliance for every IT system? Required identification of all systems in use and that access federal information, and validation of their compliance. To help aid agencies in obtaining this, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has released a series of guidelines, checklists, and templates that detail acceptable configurations for systems. 

Risk Assessment: The agency must have an agency-wide information security program that includes controls and checks to ensure effectiveness, including reporting on existing risks and responses. 

Incident response: The NIST Controls document outlines specific steps to follow and functions to perform depending on the level of threat posed by the environment. 

Intrusion detection: Requires reporting on cyber security, risks and responses. 

Boundary protection: Systems and applications should be protected from unauthorized access, both from outside the agency and its contractors, and from within. 

Compliance Reporting: Requires detailed reporting on FISMA compliance status. 
 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) - Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and Special Publication (SP) Series (800 Series):
http://www.nist.gov/ 
http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/by-num.htm
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html 

NIST has issued FIPS 200 - Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems in March 2006 that mandates NIST Special Publication 800-53 Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems as a federal requirement. The CMS Information System (IS) Acceptable Risks and Safeguards (ARS) document - http://www.cms.hhs.gov/InformationSecurity/14_Standards.asp#TopOfPage, was developed in response to FIPS 200 and is the companion document to the NIST SP 800-53, establishes the minimum set of security controls a federal information system must meet from the approved set of CMS security controls identified for each security level.

FISMA Security Audits:

The FISMA annual security audit requirement of Federal Information Systems as prescribed in NIST Special Publication 800-53 Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, require that:

Periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security policies, procedures, practices, and security controls to be performed with a frequency depending on risk, but no less than annually. 

The security audit of an organization that supports a Federal Information System will need to follow the NIST Special Publication 800-53 a DRAFT Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html) and FEDERAL INFORMATION
SYSTEM CONTROLS AUDIT MANUAL (FISCAM) - (www.gao.gov/special.pubs/ai12.19.6.pdf) as the baseline to establish the security audit criteria that the organization will be evaluated against. 

The business will be required to provide for: 
o	Development of FISMA baseline audit criteria and documentation;
o	Training of Auditors; 
o	Perform QIO security audit site visits;
o	Capability of visiting each of the 53 QIO facilities, 2 times over a 3 year period; 
o	Documentation of findings/weaknesses; 
o	Document FISMA compliance level and risk(s) at each QIO facility; 
o	Report detail findings to CMS via the CMS Contractor Integrated Security Suite (CISS) tool? see http://www.cms.hhs.gov/InformationSecurity/70_Guidelines_Tools.asp#TopOfPage;  
o	Track activity of findings from initial site visit to follow-up site visit;
o	Manage the milestone status of the findings and maintenance of the documented report findings via the CMS Contractor Integrated Security Suite (CISS) tool;
o	Provide an update of status of the Corrective Action Plans (CAPS) Monthly updates;
o	Input updated information into the CMS Contractor Integrated Security Suite (CISS) tool Monthly updates;
o	Produce the monthly Project of Action & Milestones (POA&M) update from the CISS tool for submission to CMS Office of Information Services (OIS);
o	Produce a FINAL report detailing the estimated cost and actual weaknesses identified for each QIO, including a grand total for the entire report, for the weaknesses that could not be addressed under the current 9th SOW QIO contract.

<DESC>This is a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information (RFI).  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  As proscribed in the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act, the Air Force is in the process of implementing a fee-for-service aerial refueling (FFS/AR) pilot program as a complement to existing Air Force organic capability.  The purpose of the pilot program is to assess the feasibility and utility of incorporating commercial service provider(s) in Air Force operations long-term.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market research effort being conducted by Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) to determine potential sources capable of providing this fee-for-service aerial refueling service.  Under the pilot program, each service provider refueling aircraft must be able to off-load fuel utilizing centerline flying boom equipment and a probe and drogue system.  The latter may be satisfied by one or both of: 1) centerline hose/drogue equipment; 2) multi-point hose/drogue equipment (i.e. wingtip refueling pods).  No developmental funding is available to capitalize or establish sources capable of providing this service.  Respondents should also assume that no government furnished property will be available to establish any commercial aerial refueling capability (such as excess KC-135 aircraft or spare aerial refueling components such as center-line booms).  The government is interested in identifying sources of commercial-off-the-shelf aerial refueling services that are or will be capable of initiating performance in the FY09/10 timeframe.  Potential sources should include their size status for NAICS code 481212.

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  In accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation the Government is conducting Market Research.  This Market Research is for information and planning purposes only.  Before submitting any information to the Government, be advised that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of these questions or to otherwise pay for the information you provide.  Your responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.  This information will be used to assist in developing the acquisition strategy.  Any information provided by the Government at this time is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to a formal release of a Request for Proposal.

The government may award contracts for concept refinement studies if more detailed information on fee-for-service aerial refueling is needed based on responses to this RFI.  The concept refinement studies may be awarded through the Broad Area Announcement (BAA) process.  If concept refinement studies are needed, they will be synopsized approximately two months from the date of this announcement.

As set forth in the FY08 NDAA, the pilot program will be not less than five years.  Multiple contractors may be selected to participate in the pilot program.  The pilot program will not exceed more than two aerial refueling aircraft per provider.  The pilot program may encompass and/or evaluate the following missions as directed in the FY08 NDAA:  testing support, training support to receiving aircraft, homeland defense support, deployment support, air bridge support, aeromedical evacuation, and emergency air refueling.  Additional missions may be incorporated as Air Force requirements are established.

In responding to this RFI, the government is specifically interested in receiving the following information from interested FFS/AR providers.  Information collected will be used to assist the government in drafting its requirements and establishing its acquisition strategy for the pilot program.

1)	Describe your ability to acquire/develop/operate/certify aerial refueling aircraft equipped with both flying boom-type and multi-point probe and drogue fuel delivery systems in light of the desired FY09/10 pilot program initiation date;

2)	Describe your current or planned capability to hire/train/certify personnel qualified to perform/sustain the aerial refueling service (including flying boom operators);

3)	What are the minimum and maximum allowable annual flying hours you could provide as a FFS/AR pilot program provider?

4)	Identify any anticipated legal/indemnification/insurance issues the government might encounter in utilizing FFS AR from your firm; 

5)	Describe your knowledge of and your capability to obtain Federal Aviation Administration certification (to include parts 91, 121, and 125), and public-use certification for the military air refueling issues for CONUS and outside CONUS operations; 

6)	Describe the potential costs-to-the-government of utilizing your commercial fee-for-service program that would not be captured in the pilot program's pricing.  Specifically the government is interested in the potential liabilities it might face at the completion of the pilot program if commercial FFS/AR is not continued with your firm.

7)	Describe your firm's experience in performing in conjunction with Air Mobility Command operations and your organizations ability to integrate its operations (existing or planned) with those of AMC.

8)	In order to reduce the impact to current refueling fleet training during the pilot program, we are interested in proposed billing concepts that enable receiving aircraft to pay for services through their respective flying hour program, versus using existing refueling aircraft flying hour funding.  Describe your capability to utilize this type of billing procedure.

9)	Describe your firm's current or planned capability to collect the following data for the pilot program as directed by Section 1081 of the 2008 NDAA:
(a) Missions flown;
(b) Mission areas supported;
(c) Receiver aircraft number, type, model series refueled;
(d) Fuel dispensed;
(e) Departure reliability rates;

10)	Describe any other fee-for-service program efforts you may have had with the U.S. Government for aerial refueling or other air transport services.     If any, please state your last commitment.
a)	Type of service provided
b)	Date(s) of service provided
c)	Government point of contact (name, phone number, e-mail address)

11)	Identify the quantity, size and type of aerial refueling equipment organic to your company at the present time.

12)	Are your company's existing or planned aircraft or AR equipment owned or leased?

13)	Are your personnel currently qualified to provide aerial refueling services of the types contemplated above?

14)	If not, describe your firm's plans to ensure they are qualified and provide your concept to maintain aircrew proficiency. 

15)	What percentage of your company's assets or fleet will be dedicated to USAF support during the pilot program?

16)	What is your expected turn around time for providing aerial refueling mission support to AMC (i.e. time between sorties)?

17)	What is the location of your present/planned operating locations for AR services?

18)	How much advance notification is required to meet AMC AR mission tasking requirements under the pilot program?

19)	Request you supply the Air Force with a copy of your company's portfolio (e.g., balance sheet, income statement and statement of retained earnings).

20)	Provide company point(s) of contact, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and company status (i.e., small business, HUBZone business, etc.).
Responses submitted should be one copy, a maximum of fifty pages in length, and must be received by 28 March 2008.  Request for Information responses may be submitted electronically or regular mail, but require both electronic and hard copies of responses.   Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size in accordance with the size standard; ensure that the company name, address, a point of contact with e-mail address and telephone number, Federal CAGE Code, and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.   No collect calls will be accepted.  Responses should be sent to ASC/XR, (Eric Crawford), 2145 Monahan Way, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH  45433-7017.     Questions should be directed to Mr. Eric Crawford at 937-255-2649, email eric.crawford@wpafb.af.mil.

The Government extends an invitation to potential prime contractors for the Fee-For-Service Aerial Refueling pilot program to present capabilities briefings in person the week of 14 April 2008.  These face-to-face sessions will be limited to one hour each and will be conducted at Wright-Patterson AFB OH.  Firms interested in scheduling a face-to-face session should contact the above point of contact for available times.  The government will not be able to provide industry with information on any future Fee-For-Service Aerial Refueling request for proposal during these sessions as more detailed requirements documents do not yet exist.

[Modification 2 change - reduced Industry Day face-to-face sessions to one hour per firm.]

<DESC>Request for Information: Portable, Automated Exam Data Collection


Postal Service Background 

The United States Postal Service (USPS) administers and maintains a number of pre-hire and post-training examinations for purposes of evaluating applicants and employees? job-related qualifications and training.  Included among those examinations are three that require examiners to observe examinees performing specific job-related activities and record observed behaviors:  the Initial Road Test (Examination 804), the End-of-training Road Test (Examination 806), and the Automotive Bench Test (Examination 941).  The USPS is interested in automating the recording of examination behaviors, in order to further expedite data capture and scoring.

Postal Service Information

The U.S. Postal Service currently has three work-sample examinations that are administered in a one-on-one environment, where the examiner observes the examinee and records observed, exam-related behaviors.  Currently, the behaviors are recorded on a scannable form, then the form is scanned and a score is generated.  We are interested in seeking solutions to automate this process.

Two of the examinations are driving exams, where the examiner is riding in the passenger side of a moving vehicle while recording observed behaviors.  The third examination is an automotive maintenance exam, where the examiner is observing the examinee in a workroom environment.  Because of the mobile nature of the examination administrations, it is important that the automated solution also be mobile, such as a laptop, electronic notepad, digital pen or handheld display device.  Further, the driving exam form includes over 100 behaviors and the behaviors are not performed sequentially.  Therefore, the form or interface needs to allow for examiners to easily view and read test items, quickly navigate among and locate the appropriate items, and record them while sitting in a moving vehicle.

An examinee?s score is calculated by combining the values of the behaviors observed (or not observed), following a pre-determined scoring algorithm.  Examinees pass or fail as a result of their exam score, based on a pre-set passing score. 

We are seeking an automated solution to use for administering these examinations.  We are interested in learning about automated solutions that offer one or more of the following benefits:
1.	A portable device that can be held, carried, viewed and accessed in a moving vehicle and in a work room.
2.	A user-friendly interface for examiners to view behavioral statements and mark when observed or not observed.
3.	Automated exam scoring.
4.	Data transfer to a central database.

              Contracting Officer
              HH-65 Product Line Division
              USCG Aircraft Repair and Supply Center
              Elizabeth City, NC  27909-5001

Advance copies may be sent by e-mail to claudette.y.surrento@uscg.mil (Contract Specialist) including the following in the subject line  H-65 RADALT  Comments, Company Name.  Correspondence must include a company point of contact with address, phone number and email address.

The Coast Guard will consider the information provided by qualified suppliers in the development of the avionics modernization plan for the H-65 and H-60 aircraft.

Additional Project Details

1.0	Scope
The RADALT system may be installed in 102 H-65 and 42 H-60 aircraft.  The requirement will include spares and repair.  The system and associated support plans will be designed to minimize Coast Guard inventory requirements.  Additional systems may be acquired.  

2.0	Background
The Coast Guard operates 102 H-65 and 42 H-60 aircraft.  The Coast Guard H-60 fleet is in the process of being upgraded by incorporation of the US Army Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS).  The Coast Guard is seeking to simplify logistics and reduce total engineering development cost by incorporating the CAAS system in the H-65.   

The Honeywell P/N HG7502AJ02 RADAR Altimeter is integrated in the H-65 avionics system.  The current system will remain in service for at least four years until it is replaced by CAAS.  The Honeywell P/N HG7502AJ02 RADAR Altimeter provides altitude signals to numerous avionics components and drives two Honeywell JG-1072AJ02-NVG indicators that provide height above ground information to the pilots' instrument panels.  

The HH-65 is a derivative of the Eurocopter Dauphin aircraft.  The current configuration is similar to the AS 365N3.  The aircraft was originally built to FAR part 29 standards.  Modifications to the aircraft are designed to current FAR 29 standards with exceptions approved for Coast Guard specific requirements.  

3.0	Modernization Planning

The H-65 avionics systems improvements will replace existing equipment with current available commercial and government-supplied components.  The system will include dual Honeywell HG764/GU Embedded GPS Inertial Navigation systems (EGI) and a CAAS compatible RADAR Altimeter system (RADALT).  The flight management system will be incorporated in the Collins CDU-7000.  The RADALT system will be fully integrated with the flight management system.  

RADALT height information will be displayed to the pilot on the CAAS display system.  

The Coast Guard does not own data rights for the Honeywell P/N HG7502AJ02 RADAR Altimeter.

3.1	Support
Depot repair capability is desired.  The support structure will be based on existing Coast Guard support contracts.  The support strategy will be included in the system procurement process.  

3.2	Open Architecture
The RADALT will be designed to incorporate an open architecture to the greatest extent possible and use standard government and commercial protocols.  The system should minimize proprietary interfaces and systems.  Data developed at government expense will be used by the government without restriction.

4.	Vendor Qualification
The supplier must be an original equipment manufacturer for RADAR Altimeter systems.  The supplier must have been approved by the US Department of Defense (DOD) or GSA (or equivalent as determined by the best value source selection team) as an aircraft RADALT supplier or have been included as part of an approved supplemental type certificate for installation of RADALT systems on US commercial aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration.  

The supplier must have experience working with civil and military airworthiness authorities.  The supplier must explain in their response how they would certify the airworthiness of their equipment.  The supplier must explain in their response how they would insure compatibility with the current H-65 and future CAAS systems.  

The supplier must have or establish a permanent presence in the United States staffed with English speaking technical support personnel.  All system documentation must be available in readily understandable English language format.

5.	Evaluation
After evaluation of the information received, the Coast Guard may issue a separate request for proposals.

The information received will be used to determine if a sole source award is justified.

If more than one source is qualified, selection and contract award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer provides the best value to the Government determined by a balanced, performance based evaluation of system capabilities, acceptance of the government defined comprehensive support requirements, past performance, delivery and price.

The planned system evaluation criteria are: Technical Capability, Past Performance, Risk, Experience, Delivery and Price.  Proposals that exceed the basic requirements will be considered.

The evaluation and source selection process will consider each offeror's capability to provide a technical solution that best aligns with the requirements, is within the proposed schedule, and is affordably priced.  An integrated assessment of the strengths, weaknesses, and risks of each offeror's proposal, together with the cost proposed, will be used to determine which proposal offers the best overall value to the Government.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (SS) NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide an IT Security Audit of an organization/facility that will determine if that organization is in compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).  The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002, outlines requirements to secure Federal information.  Each Federal Agency, including contractors or other organizations who work with the agency, must develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program.  The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) provides detailed guidance and recommendations for FISMA compliance. The National Institute for Standards and Technology guidelines encompass all aspects of information security.

In addition, to submitting a response to the Sources Sought, businesses can voluntarily?  Register as Interested Vendor?  On the Federal Business Opportunities website in order to promote teaming and/or prime and subcontractor relationships.

History:

The Standard Data Processing System (SDPS) consists of many data and reporting requirements that have been designed and developed in response to the ongoing ADP requirements of the various QIOs and other affiliated partners, such as the Clinical Data Abstraction Center (CDAC) to fulfill its contractual requirements with CMS.  This system, which became operational is May 1997, interfaces with CMS Central Office, 53 QIOs and CDAC.  Through the SDPS, the QIOs have a database of current Part A claims data, ad-hoc capability to access Part B data, access to national data sets, software tools for data analysis, report generation tools, and project information.

The Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) are critical elements of the SDPS project within QualityNet.  The SDPS is administrated by CMS, and is designed to monitor and improve utilization and quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries.  The QIO network infrastructure is comprised of a national network of fifty-three (53) QIOs responsible for each U.S. state, territory, and the District of Columbia.  Each QIO maintains a staff of mutli-disciplinary experts in medicine, quality improvement, health information management, IT Systems Security, Statistical analysis, computer programming and operations, communications, public relations, and clerical/administrative support.  The QIO network structures are configured identically with Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and are managed and supported by CMS IT support contractors.

Historically, the QIO organizations were exempt from meeting the FISMA standards.  But, with the increasing threat to Identity Theft and the OMB mandates to strengthen the security posture of the Federal Information Systems that contain sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII), CMS can no longer accept the risk.  The QIO organizations must now move towards FISMA compliance.

The goal is to quantify and document the existing security posture of the QIO organizations from a FISMA compliance standpoint.

BACKGROUND
________________________________________________________________
Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA): 
http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/m03-19.pdf 

The ability to provide an IT Security Audit of an organization/facility that will determine if that organization is in compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002, outlines requirements to secure Federal information. Each Federal Agency, including contractors or other organizations who work with the agency, must develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program. The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) provides detailed guidance and recommendations for FISMA compliance. NIST guidelines encompass all aspects of information security.

FISMA sections 3544 and 3505 require the following: 

Compliance for every IT system? Required identification of all systems in use and that access federal information, and validation of their compliance. To help aid agencies in obtaining this, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has released a series of guidelines, checklists, and templates that detail acceptable configurations for systems. 

Risk Assessment: The agency must have an agency-wide information security program that includes controls and checks to ensure effectiveness, including reporting on existing risks and responses. 

Incident response: The NIST Controls document outlines specific steps to follow and functions to perform depending on the level of threat posed by the environment. 

Intrusion detection: Requires reporting on cyber security, risks and responses. 

Boundary protection: Systems and applications should be protected from unauthorized access, both from outside the agency and its contractors, and from within. 

Compliance Reporting: Requires detailed reporting on FISMA compliance status. 
 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) - Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and Special Publication (SP) Series (800 Series):
http://www.nist.gov/ 
http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/by-num.htm
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html 

NIST has issued FIPS 200 - Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems in March 2006 that mandates NIST Special Publication 800-53 Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems as a federal requirement. The CMS Information System (IS) Acceptable Risks and Safeguards (ARS) document - http://www.cms.hhs.gov/InformationSecurity/14_Standards.asp#TopOfPage, was developed in response to FIPS 200 and is the companion document to the NIST SP 800-53, establishes the minimum set of security controls a federal information system must meet from the approved set of CMS security controls identified for each security level.

FISMA Security Audits:

The FISMA annual security audit requirement of Federal Information Systems as prescribed in NIST Special Publication 800-53 Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, require that:

Periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security policies, procedures, practices, and security controls to be performed with a frequency depending on risk, but no less than annually. 

The security audit of an organization that supports a Federal Information System will need to follow the NIST Special Publication 800-53 a DRAFT Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html) and FEDERAL INFORMATION
SYSTEM CONTROLS AUDIT MANUAL (FISCAM) - (www.gao.gov/special.pubs/ai12.19.6.pdf) as the baseline to establish the security audit criteria that the organization will be evaluated against. 

The business will be required to provide for: 
o	Development of FISMA baseline audit criteria and documentation;
o	Training of Auditors; 
o	Perform QIO security audit site visits;
o	Capability of visiting each of the 53 QIO facilities, 2 times over a 3 year period; 
o	Documentation of findings/weaknesses; 
o	Document FISMA compliance level and risk(s) at each QIO facility; 
o	Report detail findings to CMS via the CMS Contractor Integrated Security Suite (CISS) tool? see http://www.cms.hhs.gov/InformationSecurity/70_Guidelines_Tools.asp#TopOfPage;  
o	Track activity of findings from initial site visit to follow-up site visit;
o	Manage the milestone status of the findings and maintenance of the documented report findings via the CMS Contractor Integrated Security Suite (CISS) tool;
o	Provide an update of status of the Corrective Action Plans (CAPS) Monthly updates;
o	Input updated information into the CMS Contractor Integrated Security Suite (CISS) tool Monthly updates;
o	Produce the monthly Project of Action & Milestones (POA&M) update from the CISS tool for submission to CMS Office of Information Services (OIS);
o	Produce a FINAL report detailing the estimated cost and actual weaknesses identified for each QIO, including a grand total for the entire report, for the weaknesses that could not be addressed under the current 9th SOW QIO contract.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is seeking to identify businesses, in particular Small Business sources, (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide the activities  required by the Medicaid Integrity Program provisions in the Deficit Reduction Act.  The information from this market research will help CMS plan their acquisition strategy.  

Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA Schedule contract.

Background:

Medicaid was enacted in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act).  Title XIX of the Act is a Federal/State entitlement program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources.  Medicaid is a cooperative venture jointly funded by the Federal and State governments (including the District of Columbia and the Territories) to assist States in furnishing medical assistance to eligible needy persons.  Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for America??s poorest people.  

Within broad national guidelines governed by Federal statutes, regulations, and policies, each State: (i) establishes its own eligibility standards, (ii) determines the type, amount, duration, and scope of services, (iii) sets the rate of payment for services, (iv) and administers its own program.  While State participation in Medicaid is voluntary, all States have chosen to participate.  The federal government supports state administration by providing matching funds and establishing general programmatic guidelines.  

In accordance with the statute, the Medicaid program by law is the payer of last resort.  Third party liability (TPL) refers to the legal obligation of third parties to pay all or some of the health care costs of Medicaid services provided under a State Plan.  Examples of third parties are:  private health insurers, employer-sponsored health insurance, Medicare, workers?? compensation, liability settlement, medical-support orders, long-term-care insurance, and estate recovery.  Billions of dollars each year are reported by states to CMS as Medicaid savings attributed to third party liability activities.  These programs are complex and include activities associated with the eligibility-determination process, claims-payment system, and reimbursement methodologies developed by state Medicaid programs.  The TPL policies and procedures are governed by both federal and state laws.

Section 6034 of the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005, signed February 8, 2006, established the Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP).  Under this contract, MIP functions are to be performed by the MIC.  The MIP offers a unique opportunity to identify, recover, and prevent overpayments.  It will also support the efforts of State Medicaid agencies through a combination of oversight and technical assistance.  While CMS has a wealth of experience in the financial management of the Medicaid program, the auditing of those who provide direct services to Medicaid beneficiaries has always been the responsibility of the States.  


The Education of Provider Medicaid Integrity Contractor (MIC) shall be prepared to provide Educational efforts or training that may take place in any State (including the District of Columbia and the Territories) that is receiving Federal funds under Medicaid.  The Contractor will be required to travel to all locations to which training is to be provided.  The Contactor will also be required to gather and / or create a compilation of all educational and training material into one or several training manuals/guides, a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) guide, as appropriate.  All of the items above will be updated as the information becomes available and/or as appropriate.

Standard templates for educational materials and efforts in coordination with CMS to ensure consistency and branding of MIC educational efforts may also be required.  The Contractor may communicate with individuals and entities only after having received written approval from CMS.  An example of these communications may be, but not limited to, the following: CMS Website, CMS List server, Provider Partner Emails, Exhibits at association conferences, and national training calls.

CMS requests capability statements to this Sources Sought/RFI from particularly Small Businesses.  Based on the market research, CMS anticipates soliciting for multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  

The contractor will need to furnish the necessary services and qualified personnel, facilities, equipment, materials, and supplies not specifically provided by the government under the terms of this requirement or as indicated in each individual Task Order. The Contractor will provide all the necessary resources required for performance as a full Contractor within 30 days from contract award and within 10 days of issuance of a Task Order for all tasks as may be identified, unless otherwise specified in each Task Order.

At a minimum, your capability statement shall include the following information:

1.  Business Information:

a.	DUNS:
b.	Company Name;
c.	Company Address;
d.	Type of Company (i.e. small business, 8(a) woman owned, veteran owned, etc.) As validated via the CCR.  All offerors must register on the Central Contractor Registration located at http://www.ccr.gov/index.asp.
e.	Company Point of Contact, Phone and E-mail address of individuals who can verify the capabilities/experience identified in the responses.

Teaming Arrangements:  All teaming arrangements shall also include the above-cited information and certifications for each entity on the proposed team. Teaming arrangements are encouraged. 

Responses must be submitted electronically to the contract specialist listed below not later than March 22, 2008. Capability statements will not be returned and will not be accepted after the due date.  The maximum number of pages for submission is 10 pages.

This Sources Sought Notice is information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this Notice.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Notice.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of this evaluation.  Capability statements will not be returned and will not be accepted after the due date.

2.	Address your ability to develop educational materials that include, but are not limited to, both aggregate data and specific risk areas that may include topics related to Medicaid fraud, waste, and abuse of individuals or entities furnishing items or services under the Medicaid program; and identification of improper payments to individuals or entities receiving Federal funds under Medicaid.

<DESC>The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a significant and continuing need for services to support the execution of their mission - to lead and support the Department and its components, including federal, state, local, territorial, and the private sector, in securing the homeland, defending our citizenry, and protecting our critical infrastructure.  It is the intent of DHS that the provision of all such services, with the exception of Information Technology, will be acquired and managed through an umbrella program with the name of OMNIBUS.

The purpose of the OMNIBUS program is to provide effective, world-class services in support of achieving the OIA mission objectives while efficiently maximizing the use of competition and meeting the socio-economic procurement goals and objectives of DHS.

The DHS, Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), invites interested vendors to respond to this notice to 1) identify their interest in participating in the planned procurement, and 2) to provide feedback/comments on the attached Concept of Operations (CONOPS) that describes aspects of the OMNIBUS program.

It is important to note that vendor responses are solely for the purpose of market research and neither constitute pre-competition, nor will they be evaluated in any way.  Likewise, the CONOPS neither represents an official Acquisition Plan nor does it commit the government to any course of action in the future.

Responses identifying an interest in participating in the procurement will serve to assist DHS in determining the feasibility of its plans with respect to achieving its socio-economic procurement goals and objectives, and to gauge the extent of interest.  Vendor responses of interest should provide the following information for each of the four categories described in the CONOPS for which they might respond:

	OMNIBUS Category
	Company Name/Division
	Applicable NAICS code
	Socio-economic status
	Single point-of-contact name, title, telephone, and email address
	Size and complexity of current or prior similar efforts
	Types of federal and commercial organizations supported.
 
DHS considers the responses it may receive with respect to feedback and comments on the CONOPS to be a valuable and critical component of its Market Research and will carefully consider all inputs provided.  In turn, vendor responses concerning the CONOPS should be considered industry's opportunity to participate in helping the government shape the OMNIBUS program.  DHS appreciates that providing such input could be construed as having the potential to impact a vendor?s competitive advantage, were such input to be identified by its source; and thus assures potential respondents that the government will not identify the source of any information received.

<DESC>Market Research Notice

The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a significant and continuing need for services to support the execution of their mission - to lead and support the Department and its components, including federal, state, local, territorial, and the private sector, in securing the homeland, defending our citizenry, and protecting our critical infrastructure.  It is the intent of DHS that the provision of all such services, with the exception of Information Technology, will be acquired and managed through an umbrella program with the name of OMNIBUS.

The purpose of the OMNIBUS program is to provide effective, world-class services in support of achieving the OIA mission objectives while efficiently maximizing the use of competition and meeting the socio-economic procurement goals and objectives of DHS.

The DHS, Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), invites interested vendors to respond to this notice to 1) identify their interest in participating in the planned procurement, and 2) to provide feedback/comments on the attached Concept of Operations (CONOPS) that describes aspects of the OMNIBUS program.

It is important to note that vendor responses are solely for the purpose of market research and neither constitute pre-competition, nor will they be evaluated in any way.  Likewise, the CONOPS neither represents an official Acquisition Plan nor does it commit the government to any course of action in the future.

Responses identifying an interest in participating in the procurement will serve to assist DHS in determining the feasibility of its plans with respect to achieving its socio-economic procurement goals and objectives, and to gauge the extent of interest.  Vendor responses of interest should provide the following information for each of the four categories described in the CONOPS for which they might respond:

	OMNIBUS Category
	Company Name/Division
	Applicable NAICS code
	Socio-economic status
	Single point-of-contact name, title, telephone, and email address
	Size and complexity of current or prior similar efforts
	Types of federal and commercial organizations supported.
 
DHS considers the responses it may receive with respect to feedback and comments on the CONOPS to be a valuable and critical component of its Market Research and will carefully consider all inputs provided.  In turn, vendor responses concerning the CONOPS should be considered industry's opportunity to participate in helping the government shape the OMNIBUS program.  DHS appreciates that providing such input could be construed as having the potential to impact a vendor's competitive advantage, were such input to be identified by its source; and thus assures potential respondents that the government will not identify the source of any information received.  Further, the government instructs respondents to specifically mark any part of their response that they consider to be proprietary in nature.  

Vendors are invited to address any area of the CONOPS, but the government is particularly interested in feedback and comments in these areas:

	Applicable industry best practices, both in the private as well as the public sectors
	The categorization by contractor skill and experience sets of the functional areas served 
	The use of multiple awards in each category and ongoing competition at the task level
	Contract types
	Socio-economic considerations
	The use of sequential evaluation and selection for each category and the resulting reduced area of consideration for each successive category
	Performance-based considerations

DHS will only give consideration to submissions in response to this notice that are in the form of Microsoft Word 2003 documents attached to emails received no later than 2:00 PM, March 21, 2008, addressed to Paul Attorri, Contracting Officer, at the following email address:  Paul.Attorri@dhs.gov.


Concept of Operations

Introduction 

The mission of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is to lead and support the Department and its components, including federal, state, local, territorial, and the private sector, in securing the homeland, defending our citizenry, and protecting our critical infrastructure.

I&A requires a wide variety of contractual support services to assist them in achieving their mission.  The OMNIBUS acquisition is intended to provide those needed services (other than information technology) under an umbrella program called OMNIBUS.  The purpose of the OMNIBUS program is to provide effective, world-class services in support of achieving the OIA mission objectives while efficiently maximizing the use of competition and meeting the socio-economic procurement goals and objectives of DHS.

Purpose

This document is a descriptive planning document that is intended to evolve as the acquisition evolves.  An initial use of this document will be to serve as the basis for requesting industry feedback in conjunction with the conduct of market research.

This document should not be construed in any way as the official OMNIBUS acquisition plan, nor does it commit the government to a particular course of action.

OMNIBUS Structure

The OMNIBUS program will consist of multiple contractual vehicles categorized into four categories intended to reflect the unique contractor experience and skill sets required for successful performance of each. 

The four categories and the principal areas of support are:

1.	Organizational Management Support

	Human Capital Resources
	Budget/Resource Management
	Administrative Support
	Security Support
	Logistics and Facilities Management
	Planning, Programming, and Performance Management Support
	Strategic Planning
	Policy Support
	Program Management Support

2.	Core Intelligence and Information Services

       Intelligence Analysis
	Collection Requirements Support
	Exercise and Continuity of Operations/Continuity of Government (COOP/COG) Support
	International Relations
	Information Management Support
	Counterintelligence (CI) Program Support
	State and Local Fusion Centers Support
	Subject  Matter Expertise (SME) Support

3.	Training

	Registrar Support
	Course Development Support
	Training Delivery Support
	Training Program Management Support
	Distance Learning Support

4.	Special Studies and Assessments

	Independent Assessments
	Analytical Studies
	Special Studies or Emergent Situations

Proposals, Evaluation and Selection

It is the government's intent for performance under the OMNIBUS program to begin in early FY 2009.

The OMNIBUS Contracts will be awarded from a single solicitation covering four separate and consecutive evaluation and selection activities, one for each support category.  All contract award selections will be based on Best Value principles.  Significant emphasis during the evaluation will be placed on relevant experience, technical and management approaches, practices and methodologies, and understanding of the requirement.

The planned sequential order of evaluation and selection is:

1.	Training
2.	Organizational Management Support
3.	Core Intelligence and Information Services
4.	Special Studies and Assessments

Offers in response to the OMNIBUS RFP must be in the form of separate and distinct proposals for one or more of the four functional categories, addressing the requirements and evaluation criteria unique to each category.  The government recognizes that a distinct set of skills and experiences is required for successful performance in each category, notwithstanding that that there are potential crossover areas, and that any one offering entity may possess multiple skill/experience sets.  Thus, there will not be a restriction on the number of categories for which an offeror may submit a proposal.  

Just as the government recognizes that some potential offerors may be qualified to perform in multiple categories, it also recognizes that potential organizational conflicts of interest would be inherent in cross-category contract performance.  The government requires the avoidance of even the appearance of such conflict.  Therefore, as the government proceeds through its stated sequential evaluation and selection process, offerors selected for award under a given category will be eliminated from further consideration for award in any subsequent category evaluation and will not be able to subcontract in any other category.

Award and Performance

The following table illustrates the planned levels of competition, contract awards and types, and work tasking methodology:

Category	RFP Competition/Socio-Economic Goals	Single/Multiple Awards	Contract Type	Work Tasked by
Training	FAR Part 15, Set-Aside (Type TBD)	Multiple Awards	FFP, IDIQ	Competitive Task Orders*
Organizational Management Support	FAR Part 15, Small Business Set-Aside	Multiple Award	FFP, IDIQ	Competitive Task Orders*
Core Intelligence and Information Services	FAR Part 15, Unrestricted Competition, Requirement for 35% Small and Small/Disadvantaged  Business Subcontracting	Multiple Awards	FFP, IDIQ	Competitive Task Orders*
Special Studies and Assessments	FAR Part 8, GSA Schedule Holders without restriction 	Multiple Awards	Blanket Purchase Agreements	Competitive Delivery Orders*
?* - Contracts will allow for non-competitive orders when properly justified.

Period of Performance

The period of performance for the awarded contracts will be one year with four one-year options.  The BPA period of performance will be five years.

Task-Level Competition

Work will be competed and tasked within each of the functional areas among the multiple awardees, each of which by virtue of having been awarded a contract is deemed qualified and capable of performing the work to be tasked.

Task-level competition will focus on the qualifications of specific personnel proposed to perform, approach, exceptional experience or capabilities the offeror will provide, and past performance under the OMNIBUS program.

Task-Level competitions will be highly streamlined and are intended to be awarded within fourteen calendar days from the release of the requirement.

Performance-Based Considerations

It is the goal of DHS to maximize the use of appropriated performance-based methodologies.  However, DHS does not today have the baseline performance metrics necessary to implement such arrangements.  DHS further recognizes that not all work to be performed under these contracts would lend itself to performance-based arrangements.  

To further the effort to maximize the appropriate use of performance-based contracting arrangements, each of the contracts under the Program Management Support, Core Intelligence Services, and Training categories will include the capability to transition into a full or partial implementation of performance-based characteristics such as incentive/disincentive payments and/or service level agreements.  

The establishment of successful performance-based contracting arrangements optimally stems from collaboration between the government and its contractor.  To that end, the first time a body of work is tasked, the contractor performing that work will be required to make a formal recommendation to the government as to what, if any, parts of the work have the potential to be performance-based.  The government, upon consideration, may then direct the contractor to capture baseline performance metrics for the remainder of the period of performance.  In any case, the government will review all tasks prior to their re-competition to determine the appropriateness of incorporating a performance-based aspect of the task into further/continuing efforts.

The work being conducted has used LS-DYNA to develop models and conduct analyses since 2006. NIST requires the LS-DYNA licenses to continue the work being conducted for the World Trade Center Investigation.

Based on the recent market research, NIST believes that Livermore Technology Corporation is the only entity that can satisfy NIST?s requirement for Annual LS-DYNA LICENSE. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price type purchase order to Livermore Technology Corporation for this requirement.

Interested parties that are authorized by Livermore Technology Corporation to sell the aforementioned LS-DYNA software licenses may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. Such written responses will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government. The Government is currently conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 10 to identify potential sources to provide the requirement and to gather information on current capabilities within the market. All information submitted in response to this sources sought notice is voluntary and the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government. Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately

SUMMARY

The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) seeks to identify organizations that are capable of preparing and commercializing individualized packets of antibacterial drugs for use by HHS Emergency Responders.  This will be the first phase of a program that will eventually lead to licensed kits for first responders (called a First Responder MedKit) and finally for the general public (called a Household MedKit).  Under this program, individualized packets of antibacterial drugs will be provided to HHS emergency responders and critical personnel.  The first steps toward a kit for use by the general public will be in parallel to this program and include the RFP discussed below (palatability studies).  The oral antibacterial drugs included in the kit must already be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment or prophylaxis of anthrax.  In the first stage of this program, emergency response organizations at HHS will provide these kits, in accordance with applicable pharmaceutical prescribing requirements, to their employees as part of normal operational and occupational safety equipment.  The objective of this pilot program will be to develop and evaluate control systems for shipping and dispensing, expiration management, recovery and destruction, reconciliation, replenishment.  This pre-event provisioning will enable HHS emergency medical service staff and critical staff to have immediate access to potentially lifesaving chemoprophylaxis when dealing with incidents for which prompt use of such medical countermeasures is an essential part of personal protection - such as a bioterrorism attack involving the bacterium that causes anthrax.

HHS will issue a solicitation for competitive proposals for First-Responder MedKits, including options for the preparation and commercialization of the kit for use by first responders and the general public.  Approximately 100,000 kits will be acquired by HHS.  At this time, HHS is gathering information on the capabilities of the market to meet the following requirements: (1) design and prepare a prototype kit and any associated instructions for its use by HHS Emergency Responders, (2) prepare a strategy seeking approval of the kit by the FDA, for use by First Responders and the general public, (3) manufacture and furnish to the USG a predefined quantity of kits that will be provided to HHS Emergency Responders and critical staff,  (4) design and implement a system for the control of distribution, recovery, destruction, replenishment, and reconciliation, and (5) describe the organization's experience in preparing and administering an Investigational New Drug (IND) application and other regulatory documents required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

In addition, having gained premarket approval for a First-Responder kit, and depending on the ultimate approved indication and labeling, the contractor could be allowed to market the product to State, local and tribal governments and private-sector entities for use in their preparedness efforts against bioterrorism.  Awardees will be required to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with FDA during the design and conduct labeling comprehension studies to support the commercialization of the kit.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Whenever an emergency incident involves biological threats, time is of the essence.  Exposure to bacteria that cause life-threatening diseases, such as anthrax, plague, tularemia, and typhus, can have catastrophic medical consequences if not countered promptly with antibacterial drugs and other prophylactic measures.  For first responders in particular, prompt peri-incident administration of certain FDA-approved antibacterial drugs (primarily doxycycline and ciprofloxacin) can provide prophylaxis against biological threats encountered during their efforts to help others in the wake of the incident.

Initial studies were conducted by the CDC in 2006 using a prototype kit to determine if emergency home preparation instructions for storage and use of the kit could be followed.  Participants were asked to return the kit intact at specific times.  The study, conducted in St. Louis, used both doxycycline and ciprofloxacin kits and enrolled over 13,000 people from more than 4000 households.  Additional studies are likely to be required before the kit can be made available to the general public.

The immediate objective of this announcement is to meet the preparedness needs of HHS Emergency Responders.  This initial objective assumes that the users will be healthy adults who are capable of swallowing a tablet or capsule.  Subsequent objectives (First Responder MedKit or Household MedKit) will target user groups that will include individuals who may be unwilling or unable to swallow pills, such as infants and young children, and those with a medical condition that makes swallowing pills difficult or impossible.

In parallel with the current focus on an Emergency Responder kit, HHS in considering a separate acquisition initiative to develop the knowledge base needed for private-sector entities to prepare and commercialize a kit for use by the general public.  A Request for Proposals (RFP-BARDA-08-12, http://www2.fbo.gov/spg/HHS/OOS/OASPHEP/RFP-BARDA-08-12/listing.html) was published on 8 FEB 2008.  The purpose of that RFP is to identify commercial entities capable of designing and performing food palatability studies to mask the bitter taste of doxycycline and ciprofloxacin, and capable of evaluating home preparation instructions acceptability of these drugs, in terms of delivery of dose.

<DESC>ARK The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs)  are seeking preliminary information from prospective vendors capable of providing, installing, and implementing a non-developmental (off-the-shelf) anesthesia record keeping system (ARK).  Vendors responding to the RFI should only address systems with applications that are fully functioning with U.S. clinical environments and capable of meeting the mandatory requirements found in section 1 and section 4 of requirements document/questionnaire accompanying this RFI.  If analytic functions (analyses of data stored in a database) or reports are included in your proposed system, responses to the VHA Analytic RFI must be included with this submission. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to determine potential sources that would be interested and capable of providing the required capability, ensure early industry involvement in the effort, and gain critical market research information.  The submitted documentation, upon delivery in response to this RFI, becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.  No solicitation documents exist at this time. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this advertisement. This is a request for information/market research announcement for planning purposes only and the Government will not provide reimbursement of costs associated with the documentation submitted under this request.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry.  This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation.  It does not commit the government to reply to information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information.  The failure to respond to this request for information will not prohibit offerors from responding to any subsequent solicitations related to this program.  Responses to the RFI will be shared with CIS committees from other VISNs and VA hospitals.  Reasonable efforts will be made to keep responses confidential from other vendors and all non-VA personnel.  However, if vendors wish to ensure confidentiality, the vendors must redact all identifying information in their responses. The ARK CIS system will include software applications, relevant hardware, interfaces to medical devices, interfaces to VA's VistA CPRS, and interfaces to other systems as may be defined in the final system specification. The ARK CIS will integrate information acquired at the point of care from a variety of medical devices. These include, but are not limited to: physiologic monitors (GE, Philips), ventilators (Maquet, Respironics, and Puritan Bennett), anesthesia machines (Drager, Datex Ohmeda), gas analyzers, infusion pumps (B.Braun, Alaris, and Hospira), intra aortic balloon pumps, and SVO2/CCO monitors. The ICU CIS and ARK CIS will need to integrate with other information systems including, but not limited to: VA's VistA/CPRS hospital information system (Lab results, user passwords, ADT, VistA Imaging, etc.), data analytic system, and each other (ICU & ARK CIS)  In the event of subsequent solicitation and acquisition of an ARK CIS, the VA will require the following: 1.	The vendor will successfully demonstrate and certify all required interfaces (see Interface requirements) with VistA prior to contract award and initial installation 2.	All database and template modifications must be entered only once and immediately propagated to all other VISN hospitals.  Individual hospital databases and templates will be locked to prevent unapproved modifications. 3.	A site licenses that covers VISN-wide implementations for all applicable locations 4.	An implementation program to be specifically designed for VA  in order to leverage system knowledge and efficiencies 5.	A uniform maintenance program includes all application upgrades and new versions and is available immediately upon program start. 6.	Proposed systems must demonstrate that the complete application is fully functioning in U.S. clinical environments. The MSExcel spreadsheet accompanying this RFI contains a set of system requirements and characteristics that the VA desires in the ARK CIS system.   In addition, specific questions about potential solutions are found throughout the spreadsheet.  NOTE: the National System Requirements in Section 1 and the Interface Requirements found in Section 4 of the spreadsheet are mandatory.  Vendors should only provide a response for systems capable of meeting these requirements. Prospective vendors are asked to review the requirements, characteristics, and specific questions; and comment on their capability of meeting the requirements.  Responders are also encouraged to comment on the realism of the requirements, technical risk associated with the requirement; and suggest alternative specifications where appropriate.   Comments for each item are to be entered directly in the spreadsheet in the column marked "Vendor Response."

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR>---------------<BR>A.	 General Information<BR>The Europe Region (TRBO Europe), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 55 Army, Navy, and Air Force medical treatment facilities in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Southwest Asia announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Advanced Wound Care products.  This product line consists primarily of products with sizes  documented in Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process of this announcement.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically prefe rred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Cente r, U. S. Army Hospital Heidelberg, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Army He alth Center - Vicenza, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, 31st Medical Group Aviano, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella, U. S. Army 30th Medical Brigade, and U. S. Army CENTCOM.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additi onal information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three  (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is May 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selection of  a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF prefere nce and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, phone: 011-49-6221-172109, and e-mail marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the  category of Advanced Wound Care, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.   Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $650,533.50.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include: (1) Transparent Dressings: sizes- 4x4? , 5?x4, 3?x3 3/8, 2 3/8x2?, 4x5 7/8, 2x1?, 11x16, 11x4, 6x8, 5?x10, 4x8 totaling $537,804.52 purchased, (2) Hydrocolloid Dressings: si zes- 6x8, 4x4.7,4x4, 2x2 3/8, 6x6, 1?x1? totaling $48,883.73 purchased, (3) Hydrogel Dressings/Fillers: sizes- 6x6, 4x4, 8x8, tubes- ?oz, 1oz totaling $14,218.0 3 purchased, (4) Foam Dressings: sizes- 3?x3?, 4x4?, 5 5/8 x5 5/8, 7?x8?, 5 5/8x6 1/8, 5?x5? totaling $8,128.72 purchased, (5) Alginate Dressings: sizes- 2x2, 4x4, 4x8, 12in rope totaling $3,634.25 purchased.  (All sizes noted above are expressed in inches  unless otherwise identified.)  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company criteria below.  <BR><BR>At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementati on, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Inst ructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil.  Submi ssions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participation.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic r esponses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm w ith the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm recei pt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR><BR>The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors,  without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions list ed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Europe Region rese rves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an e fficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process:  Interested vendors will respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date.  Based on vendor re sponses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability.    After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria:  Generally, responses to all questions in  this section demonstrate: (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that th e line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Owens & Minor, the Prime Vendor (PV) for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts o ff DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqua lify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	At a minimum your company must manufacture or distribute:  (All sizes below are expre ssed in inches unless otherwise identified.)  <BR>a.	Transparent Dressings:  Sizes 4x4 3/4, 5 1/2x4, 3 3/4x3 3/8, 2 3/8x2 3/4, 4x 5 7/8, 2x1 1/2, 11x16 11x4, 6x8, 5 1/2x10, 4x8.  <BR>b.

Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Advanced Wound Care product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or  show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) Your DAPA number is: __________________.  <BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the PV (currently, Europes PV is Owens & Minor) for distribution in the Europe Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.) <BR>4.	Vendors must offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note that vendors that fail to offer a discount from DA PA will be disqualified.) <BR>5.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.<BR>6.	Your company must be able to send samples to this region by U nited States Postal Service (USPS).  This form of mailing has proven to be the best at eliminating delays due to International Customs.   <BR>7.	Vendor must be able to ship samples necessary for evaluation via United States Parcel Service eliminating delay s that occur with Europes Custom Offices.  Provide acknowledgement of this requirement with the initial submittal.<BR>8.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for the Advanced W ound Care products including dates, duration, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals.  Your company must provide history of back orders and/or recalls for the Advanced Wound Care products, which will include: dates, duration, cause, and resolu tion (WITH INITIAL SUBMITTAL).<BR>9.	For any Advanced Wound Care products containing medication, vendors must provide products with FDA approval for use in all clinical advanced wound care settings and provide literature to support this requirement (WITH I NITIAL SUBMITTAL).<BR>10.	Vendors must provide a statement revealing all products containing synthesized polymer (plastic/rubber) clearly labeled as latex free/ safe.<BR>11.	Vendors must supply a statement demonstrating instructions/directions for use with each unit of issue and provide evidence of this with their initial submittals.<BR>12.	Vendors must provide a statement confirming evidence that products can b e delivered to a sterile field with (WITH INITIAL SUBMITTAL).<BR>13.	Your company is required to provide literature support showing the mechanism that ensures normal bacteria of the wound and the promotion of wound healing.<BR>14.	Vendors must provide visu al examples demonstrating product labels with visible expiration dates of at least 12 pt fonts on all exterior, intermediate and individual packaging and provide evidence of such (WITH INITIAL SUBMITTAL).<BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Pro cess:  The multi-disciplinary CPT formed by the TPRB will request literature and/or samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment facilities.  The CPT will evaluate the product line using both a literatur e review and hands on evaluation in a non-clinical setting.  As indicated in the technical/company criteria above, vendors are required to ship samples to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the  following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (DSN 371-2108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Literature will be e-mailed or shipped via the same procedure as samples.  Vendo rs will be given 10 calendar days to ship samples.  Literature and samples must be shipped to the TRBO by COB, 4:00PM EST on the 10th calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consider ation in the standardization process. Vendors must forward verification (e-mail) of shipment to the TRBO.<BR><BR>Designated MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  One (1) is equal to not accep table, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to most acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The CPT has established a target t hreshold of 3.00 for the clinically acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Ta rget Threshold of 3.00.  Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.   <BR> <BR>To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical profes sionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in an inpat ient setting, if needed.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.00  <BR><BR>Hydrocolloid Dressings:<BR>1.	Dressing may be c ut to required size.<BR>2.	Skin remains intact when dressing is removed.<BR>3.	Dressing adheres to skin without rolling edges.<BR>4.	Dressing molds around uneven surfaces.<BR>5.	The literature displays the requirement that the dressing has a long wear time  before required change.<BR>Transparent Film Dressings:<BR>1.	Skin remains intact when dressing is removed.<BR>2.	Dressing is available in different sizes.<BR>3.	Dressing allows removal in one piece.<BR>4.	Dressing can be cut-to-fit and shaped to cover dif ficult anatomical areas.<BR>5.	Literature supports the use of dressing with other topical medications.<BR>6.	Dressing does not have an adhesive that irritates s kin.<BR>7.	The literature displays the requirement that the dressing has a high vapor transfer ability to reduce maceration of surrounding skin.<BR>Hydrogel Dressings:<BR>1.	Dressing allows visualization of wound.<BR>2.	Dressing can be removed in one piece .<BR>3.	Dressing can be cut-to-fit.<BR>4.	The literature displays the requirement that the dressing allows for moisture vapor permeability.<BR>5.	The literature displays the requirement that the dressing can be used with topical medications.<BR>Alginate Dr essings:<BR>1.	Dressing maintains its integrity when wet.<BR>2.	Dressing is removed from wound without irritating skin.<BR>3.	Dressing is soft and conformable.<BR>4.	Dressing is highly absorbent when it comes in contact with wound exudates.<BR>Foam Dressin gs:<BR>1.	Dressing can be cut without compromising its function.<BR>2.	Dressing can be shaped to cover difficult anatomical areas.<BR>3.	Dressing adheres to wound bed.<BR>4.	Dressing remains intact when saturated.<BR><BR>Market Search Request for Informati on:  Our clinicians are attempting to stay abreast of technological advances in this product line.  None of the information provided based on the following feedback will be used to determine technical or clinical acceptability. Please describe any features  that your products possess that use new design or technology.<BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process:  After the clinical/performance evaluations is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data  based on a committed volume of 80% of the total  Europe Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided ten (10) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the 1 0th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Europe Region intends to evaluat e quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company  factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volu me for a two year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  1) Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region (Post-Standardization Costs), 2) Potential Cost Avoida nce, 3) Impact of unmatched lines, and 4) Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region is considered more important than other pricing e lements.<BR><BR>

<SUBJECT>Z--Notice of Intent to Issue a Single Source Award to Dan Trampe d/b/a/ Carson Pump
<DESC>There is no solicitation.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Contracting and General Services Division in Portland, OR have a requirement to rehabilitate an existing production well (#4); to test pump the well after rehab; and to provide and install a new submersible well pump and motor.  This work shall proceed in three distinct stages for the Lahontan National Fish Hatchery (NFH), Gardnerville, NV.  Carson Pump is a small business concern and the closest vendor that has the equipment needed to pull the 400' of casing.  This firm also has a long history with well installation, service, and repair, i.e. won previous bids to rehabilitate two Lahontan NFH production wells during 2004 and 2005.   Due to the unusual and compelling circumstances, time is truly of the essence with this current requirement which will result in an additional well failure and loss of fish.  It has taken 10 years to create the captive broodstock.  The broodstock is irreplaceable due to recent fires that drastically reduced the wild population in Utah from which the broodstock was developed.   The Service intends to award Sole Source to Dan Trampe d/b/a/ Carson Pump. This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue award using other than full and open competition and is not a request for competitive proposals.  The determination of the Government not to open subject requirement was made in accordance with FAR 6.302-2.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The provision at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial applies to this acquisition.  The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. 
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Factor 1-Technical Capability; Factor 2-Past Performance; Factor 3-Price.

The evaluation factors above are listed in descending order of importance.  Technical capability and past performances when combined are more important than price.  As offerors become more equal in technical capability and past performance, price becomes increasingly more important.

Technical Capability:  Besides standard company marketing brochures that may explain technical capability, the proposal shall include a description of the Offeror's technical capability to accomplish the requirements of the SOW.  The technical capability requirement includes the requirement that the Offeror must currently have leased office and storage space at MDW International Airport.  The MDW Department of Airport (DOA) will not lease office space and storage facilities directly to 3rd party vendors.  The Contractor must include the estimated hours and number of employees in their description of technical capability to meet the janitorial requirement.  Note that the ETD Shelter cleaning under SOW paragraph 4.2.7, is only for 2 years. The outdoor ETD Shelters are no longer used and shall be removed in the future at an undetermined time therefore the shelter cleaning has been separated from the rest of the work for pricing purposes.  Limit your response to no more than five pages for technical capability.  This limit does not include standard company marketing brochures for technical capability included in the proposal.  

Past Performance:  Provide two (2) referenced contracts within the past three (3) years.  The two referenced contracts should be similar in scope and complexity to what is required under this RFQ.  Provide a short description of the contract, dollar value, and a customer point of contact (POC) name, phone number and email address.

Price Proposal:  Provide the pricing for the base year period and all four (4) yearly option periods in the pricing table provide in this solicitation.  The contract pricing must incorporate at a minimum the DOL Wage Determination rates in order to be compliant with public law.   

(b) Options: The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  The price for Options 2, 3 and 4 shall not include cost for the cleaning of ETD Shelters (SOW paragraph 4.2.7).  Option 1 will include janitorial services for Nine (9) TSA ETD Shelters as shown in the pricing table.

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for Automated System for Drying Aerogels Using Supercritical Carbon Dioxide consisting of the follow: SPECIFICATIONS for an Automated System for Drying Aerogels Using Supercritical Carbon Dioxide  A drying system is required for the processing of aerogel. The purpose of this system is to dry saturated aerogel (hydrogel) samples of various compositions from solvents using supercritical CO2. The specifications for this system are as follows: 1.	The system shall be capable of	performing the following general profile: a.	The extraction chamber(s) are manually loaded with a number of hydrogel samples immersed in solvent. b.	The surrounding bulk solvent is displaced by liquid (subcritical) carbon dioxide at a user selectable rate. c.	The samples are allowed to soak surrounded by liquid carbon dioxide for a user selectable amount of time. d.	 The now solvent-contaminated liquid carbon dioxide is displaced with clean liquid carbon dioxide at a user selectable rate. e.	Steps c and d are repeated a user selectable number of times. f.	The system is heated to bring the liquid carbon dioxide (both the bulk liquid and the liquid in the pores of the hydrogel) to a user selectable temperature above the critical point of carbon dioxide. g.	Once the carbon dioxide in the chamber reaches the selected temperature and pressure conditions, the CO2 inlet to the extraction chamber is closed, and the chamber temperature is maintained while the supercritical carbon dioxide is vented at a user selectable rate to reach ambient pressure, leaving dry aerogel samples. 2.	The system shall be composed of materials which are compatible with supercritical CO2 and common solvents such as acetone, acetonitrile, ethanol, methanol, THF, and NMP. 3.	The system shall rise to a pressure of at least 100 Bar (1450 psig) in step b, above, and maintain that minimum pressure through step f. 4.	The system shall be capable of maintaining a temperature of at least 60 ?C in the above step f., and all heated parts will be rated for continuous operation at the highest temperature the system is capable of maintaining. 5.	The system shall include four cylindrical extraction chambers, two with a nominal volume of 1 Liter each and two with nominal volumes of 4 Liters each. 6.	The minimum acceptable usable internal diameter for a 1 Liter extraction chamber is 7.62 cm (3?) 7.	The minimum acceptable usable internal diameter for a 4 Liter chamber is 15.24 cm (6?) 8.	The system shall be capable of operating with a single extraction chamber, all four extraction chambers, or any combination, all following the selected time / temperature / pressure profile. If it is not practical to operate all of the chambers in parallel (filling or draining all selected chambers simultaneously) they can be operated sequentially within a step. For a multi-chamber run it is NOT permissible to carry each chamber through steps a ? f (SEE PARAGRAPH 1 ABOVE) individually and then restart the process for the next chamber in sequence.   9.	Heated valves shall be installed wherever there is sufficient expansion of CO2 through the valve to cause freezing. (For example, if, in step d, above, the CO2 is vented to atmosphere at a controlled rate  the valve that the CO2 is vented through must be heated to prevent blockage by dry ice, residual solvent, or the condensation and freeing of water from the atmosphere.) 10.	The chamber shall be equipped with heaters sufficient to allow it to attain and maintain its maximum operating temperature. 11.	The system shall collect waste solvent as a liquid in a manner that allows it to be safely removed for proper disposal. 12.	The volume of the waste solvent collection vessel(s) shall be sufficient to contain all of the solvent collected during a drying run, with a minimum volume of 10 Liters. 13.	Carbon dioxide shall be provided to the system using a pump capable of delivering at least 450g of CO2/min at the highest rated operating pressure of the system. 14.	The pump shall be cooled using an external chiller to be provided as a part of this procurement. 15.	The system shall be equipped with temperature, pressure, and flow controls capable of controlling the system over its entire range of operation. 16.	The system shall include a capability for logging process data that includes the temperature and pressure of the extraction vessel or, at a minimum all electronic controls shall have digital outputs to allow data logging. These outputs may use RS-232 serial, USB, or an equivalent widely available standard interface. 17.	The design of the system, in particularly the direction of flow in the extraction vessel(s) and their associated plumbing shall account for the relative densities of liquid (subcritical) carbon dioxide and the commonly used acetone, acetonitrile, ethanol, methanol, THF, and NMP solvents to ensuring the efficient and complete displacement of solvent step in Paragraph 1, section b (above). 18.	The system shall be equipped with safety systems to insure the safety of operations at all times, and to prevent any component from exceeding its maximum allowable pressure. 19.	All pressure vessels that are capable of being isolated (e.g. both inlet and outlet valves closed at the same time) shall be equipped with a properly sized and certified relief device 20.	The system shall be delivered with all appropriate documentation on the pressurized parts of the system, including but not limited to: a.	U1A form with supporting documents on each pressure vessel in the system designed to operate in a range that requires it b.	If a U1A form is not necessary or appropriate for a particular vessel, that vessel shall be provided with documentation to justify its claimed pressure rating c.	Sizing calculations on all relief devices used in the system and appropriate certifications for these devices. d.	Manufacturer?s name, part number, and pressure rating on all components 21.	At least three months prior to shipment of the system, the system?s physical dimensions, power, and utility requirements shall be transmitted to the Government end-user to facilitate site preparation. Typical laboratories have water, compressed air, 120 VAC single phase and 208 VAC three-phase electrical power available." 22.	The system shall be factory assembled or assembled on-site by installation personnel. 23.	The system shall be housed in a manner that allows it to be easily moved without disassembly or disconnection of the major components from each other. (The intention of this specification is to require a substantially self-contained system where only disconnection of the building systems (Electrical, compressed air, water, ventilation, CO2 supply (if it is not housed on the system), etc. is required to move it, and does not require heavy equipment (i.e. a forklift) to move it within the laboratory. A system housed in a rack, cabinet, or frame equipped with casters would be acceptable while individually floor-mounted components would not be.) 24.	The system shall include two copies of the operator?s manual. If a separate maintenance manual is available, two copies of that manual shall be included. 25.	The system shall include 2 days of training at the installation site. Training shall be performed between 8-5PM, Monday through Friday, with the exception of government holidays, at a mutually agreed upon day and time. 26.	Vendor shall provide a warranty of at least one year from the date of acceptance of the system by the government covering all parts and labor. 27.	Vendor system shall comply with ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and/or NASA Standard NASA-STD-8719. Carbon Dioxide recycling system (OPTION) A system for the recycling of the Carbon Dioxide used in the drying process shall be included as an option, which could be procured with the main system or at a later date. 1.	The recycling system shall be capable of capturing, condensing, and reusing the CO2 used in steps b ? e of the above described drying cycle. 2.	Recycling of the CO2 vented in step g, above, is acceptable but not required. 3.	The recycling system shall be equipped to separate out or absorb residual solvent to prevent the contamination of recovered carbon dioxide, making it unsuitable for reuse. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 05-24. This procurement is a total small business set-aside. See Note 1.   The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 334516 AND 500 employees respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement.

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
(ii) Solicitation is being issued in a Request for Quote (RFQ).
(iii) This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-24.
(iv) Solicitation is issued as unrestricted competitive, all responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by this agency.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 212321 for Construction Sand and Gravel Mining, with a corresponding small business size standard of 500 employees.  Contractor must meet the stated size standard in order to be considered.
(v) Contractor shall provide Flexible Base Material unit prices with extended totals for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) as follows:  CLIN 0001:  Base Bid I, Estimated 63,000 tons for Mesilla Valley Segment; CLIN 0002: Base Bid II, Estimated 17,500 tons for Hatch/Tonuco Bridge Segment; CLIN 0003: Base Bid III, Estimated 49,000 tons for Canutillo Segment.
(vi) SPECIFICATIONS for Flexible Base Material:  I. PROJECT BACKGROUND.  The Rio Grande levees constrain river meandering (movement of the international boundary) and provide flood protection to many New Mexico cities including Las Cruces, Canutillo, Sunland Park, and Hatch.  FEMA decertification of the United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) levees in Do?a Ana County, NM, in February 2006 has resulted in public and local government pressure to upgrade the levees to FEMA criteria.  There are approximately 51.4 miles of levee in the Canalization project in Do?a Ana County that are deficient in height and do not meet the minimum 3 foot of freeboard criteria.  Of those, approximately 35.7 miles require a maximum of 2 feet of fill.  The USIBWC plans on raising these levees requiring a maximum 2 feet of fill by using USIBWC personnel.  This will enable USIBWC to certify these levees before the end of calendar year 2008.  The remaining deficient levees in Do?a Ana County, NM will be addressed under subsequent contracts.    Because the levees serve as access and maintenance roads along the floodplain and given that the flexible base material required for raising the levees does not provide a durable driving surface, a proper surfacing material must placed on the levees in areas where they will be raised.  II. DESCRIPTION.  The Contractor shall furnish and deliver only Flexible Base Material to be delivered on USIBWC?s levees in Do?a Ana County, New Mexico.  The delivery areas are separated into three distinct segments:  Mesilla Valley Segment, Hatch/Tonuco Bridge Segment, and Canutillo Segment.  These delivery areas are shown on the maps (available upon request).  The material will be used as surfacing material for USIBWC levees.  All materials furnished shall be in accordance with the requirements in these Specifications.  The material shall be furnished from no more than three material sources/borrow sites and/or quarries for each segment, throughout the duration of the contract.  Flexible base is to be spread uniform along the fill areas shown in green on the maps (available upon request).  Approximate dimensions of placement will be 6 inches by 16 ft.  III. PROJECT LOCATION:  The Rio Grande Canalization Project is located along the Rio Grande in Do?a Ana and El Paso Counties, from Percha Dam, NM to American Dam in El Paso, TX.  For this Scope of Work, material will only be delivered on USIBWC levees in Do?a Ana County, New Mexico.  Locations of these levees are shown on maps (available upon request).  IV. MATERIALS:  The Contractor shall provide flexible base materials in accordance with the requirements of ?Texas Department of Transportation, 2004 Standard Specifications for Construction and Maintenance of Highways, Streets, and Bridges? for Item 247 Flexible Base, Type A Grade 3, Physical Requirements, Type A ?

Grade 3:  Grading Requirements, U.S. Standard Sieve Size and Percent Retained: 1 inch, 0 percent; ? inch, 0-10 percent; No. 4, 45-75 percent; No. 40, 50-85 percent; Max Liquid Limit, 40 percent; and Max Plasticity Index, 12 percent.  V.  MEASUREMENT OF MATERIALS:  Measurement of flexible base material shall be measured by the ton of 2000 pounds dry weight in vehicles.  The Contractor shall provide a standard platform truck scale conforming to the requirements of ?New Mexico Department of Transportation, Interim Specifications as Replacement to the 2000 Edition Standard Specifications for Highway and Bridge Construction?, August 2005, for Section 109 ?Measurement and Payment.?  The dry weight will be determined by deducting the weight of the moisture in the material at the time of weighing from the gross weight of the material.  The moisture in the material will be determined in accordance with ASTM D 2216 or ASTM D 4643 at least once each day.  Prior to first delivery, the Contractor shall furnish the government representative, certification for the weigh masters and weigh masters? scale(s) from the New Mexico Department of Agriculture, Division of Standards and Consumers Services.  When inaccuracy or inadequacy is discovered, scale use will not be resumed until corrective measure has been completed and/or the scales calibrated.  The cost of the certified weigh masters, weigh masters? scales, scale tickets, scale house, and verifying the scale?s accuracy will not be paid for separately but shall be included in the unit prices for the weighed material.  Scales shall be furnished by the Contractor, or the Contractor may utilize commercial scales.  All scales used shall be certified and shall be operated by certified weigh masters.  The operator of each truck weighed shall obtain a scale ticket (certificate of correct weight) from the weigh master and deliver the ticket to the government representative at the point of delivery of material.  VI.  PAYMENT:  Payment for furnishing, delivering, weighing, and testing flexible base material in accordance with this Scope of Work and measured as provided under Section V ?Measurement of Materials? will be paid for at the unit price per ton for flexible base material at the quoted unit price for the corresponding segment where material was delivered.

<SOLNBR>W911W6-08-R-0007
<RESPDATE>042308
<ARCHDATE>06222008
<CONTACT>Pat Hagginbothom, 757-878-4818
<DESC>Section I:  Description:  The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate is soliciting technical and cost proposals for conduct of a Joint Heavy Lift (JHL) aerial cargo handling (CH) system concept study and design described below. Proposals are require d to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein and the referenced supplemental package.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) constitutes the total solicitation. There will be no formal Request for Proposals (RFPs), other solicitatio n requests, or other information regarding these requirements.   Submissions that merely promise incremental improvements over the existing state of the art are not of interest to the Government.  Introduction:  The future JHL is envisioned to be a vertica l takeoff and landing (VTOL) aerial system capable of conducting around the clock high tempo VTOL insertion/extraction operations into/out of austere, unprepared , restricted, complex locations to include compatibility with shipboard operations; transporti ng large numbers of personnel and/or heavy equipment and cargo.  The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to obtain new, unique and innovative ideas for solutions to technological and operational challenges. This study is focused on the ident ification and technical substantiation of a viable cargo handling system design concept as input to designing the future JHL aerial system.  This BAA will develop a conceptual design and promising component technologies that enable an assessment of new car go handling systems to improve aircraft cargo handling capabilities.  Through this effort, technologies are expected to be matured to TRL 3+ (Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof of concept) and a path defined to show h ow they can be matured to a TRL 6 by 2014.  This effort will identify concepts, technical risks, and impacts to aircraft size, performance, operational suitability, cost, schedule and critical path technologies.  This program will result in a series of tec hnologies that can be transitioned to support JHL and other future airlift systems.  For this program, transition is defined as the continuation of technology development through a future advanced technology demonstration for potential application on JHL o r other future aerial systems.  Technical Requirements: The Government is seeking new and innovative cargo handling concepts and solutions that significantly enhance productivity, total system survivability, mission effectiveness and sortie generation rate  and load factor for JHL, and other fixed or rotary wing platforms.  Specifically, the Government desires to advance the state-of-the-art by investing in the development and demonstration of technologies to: minimize (objective is to eliminate) external ma terial handling equipment to support maneuver and sustainment missions in austere and rugged areas; reduce (objective is full autonomy with human-in-the-loop (HITL) oversight) cargo handling personnel; and reduce load, restraint/release and unload times (o bjective load/unload time is 10 minutes and 3 minutes, inclusive of restraint and release) .   Through this effort, technologies are expected to be matured to a minimum of  TRL 3 (Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof of  concept).  Technology area investments are expected to contribute to overall operational performance.  Offerors shall describe a clear path for development/maturation to a TRL of 6 by 2014. A JHL notional model performance specification (MPS) has been dev eloped to provide a representative example specification for JHL.  Potential investment areas are primarily for internal cargo operations, but innovative concepts for external operations will also be considered.  Key focus areas include , but are not limit ed to,  all functionalities and operation of the overall cargo handling system(s) and  subsystems, including automation assisted loading/unloading of vehicles a nd cargo;  means of rapid restraint and release; methods to ensure safe operations on sloped or rugged terrain or ship decks (anchored or underway); operational manning requirements (minimizing personnel workload); flexibility through modularity/kitability ; crew /flight engineer efficiency; minimizing time and labor to reconfigure aircraft for various modes of transportation requirements; onboard automatic weight, balance and CG measuring and management systems; around-the-clock /adverse weather capability for externally acquiring and discharging loads without ground support personnel;  airdrop; aerial refueling; selective offloading; quick electrical/data interconnect (wired or wireless); asset visibility; interoperability with joint and commercial sectors;  and advanced external load flight control and load stabilization and in-flight external load management (e.g. automatically adjust load attitude to minimize drag or improve stability at various speeds); standoff loading.  This BAA effort shall define syst em level design concepts and/or individual components of a potential system, which provide a significant performance improvement over state of the art cargo handling technologies and meets the cargo handling capabilities in the MPS.  Offerors shall perfor m concept tradeoffs; quantify/substantiate improvements; conduct proof-of-concept demonstrations (where applicable); describe a clear path for technology development for each concept and/or component to a TRL 6 by 2014, including critical enabling technolo gies development strategy; predict impact to aircraft design and performance; and identify impact to payloads (if any).  Key considerations include performance; operational suitability; subsystem size and weight; reliability; scalability; flexibility; affo rdability; risk; and maintenance requirements.   <BR>Section II. Award Information:  ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD: The Government intends to make multiple awards; however no award is anticipated to be for more than $2 million of Governm ent funding.  Period of performance shall not exceed 18 months. Proposals must follow the guidelines described in this announcement and the supplemental package. TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT:  The Government seeks to maximize industry participation and antic ipates making multiple awards.  The Government anticipates award of  conventional contracts subject to the FAR or cost-shared Technology Investment Agreements (TIAs).   Due to the commercial application of the preponderance of this technology, the Governme nt considers award of a TIA (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358) or Other Transaction for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371) appropriate and of potential interest.  This BAA will remain open until 1:00 p.m. Eastern time April 23, 2008. Awards under this anno uncement are anticipated to be made by August, 2008.  However, unless the offeror specifies a different expiration time, proposals will be considered valid for Government acceptance through December 31, 2008. The Government reserves the right to select for  award any, all, part or none of the proposals received. Further, the Government reserves the right to select for award only a portion of an offeror's proposal (i.e., certain tasks vs. total program). Multiple proposals from the same offeror will be accept ed and evaluated independently (See Section V).  The Government seeks to include the diversity of technologies, approaches, and breadth of treatment of the entire cargo handling system and may deem an otherwise less meritorious proposal as desirable to inc rease the coverage of all aspects of the system.  Furthermore, the Government may accept greater risk in a proposal to meet these objectives. This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal prepara tion costs.  Section III.  Eligibility Information:  The supplemental package will contain, and performance will require access to, technical data that are subj ect to export control and deemed militarily critical.  In accordance with established policy and procedures for the dissemination and withholding of technical data that disclose critical technology with military application, awardees need to be enterprises  certified via DD Form 2345 to obtain export controlled technical data.  Participation of foreign sources as subcontractors is encouraged subject to approval, authorization or licensing procedures.  Due to the complexity and technical considerations of the  JHL Advanced Cargo Handling Risk Reduction (ACHRR), this announcement is not set-aside for small businesses although they are encouraged to propose.  Section IV. Submission Information:  This BAA is the only solicitation that will be issued.  The informat ion contained in this announcement is insufficient to produce a meritorious proposal.  Specific instructions to offerors and the JHL Model Performance Specification (MPS) are contained in the supplemental package available to qualified U.S. sources who hav e certification via DD Form 2345. GENERAL: The technical proposal shall be limited to 30 content pages except as otherwise stated in the supplemental package.  The technical proposal shall contain a statement of work to which the offeror proposes to be bou nd, program milestones, a description of facilities to be employed in the effort and a program management section.  Resumes of key personnel shall be provided.  The Cost Proposal should include a funding profile (a cost breakout by month), cost breakdown p roviding man-hours and monthly costs by task, all pricing rates used, and equipment and materials listings, if applicable. Subcontractor proposals, if applicable, including pricing rate details, should be provided concurrently with the prime contractor's s ubmission.  Proposals must be submitted in original and 8 copies (Technical/Management Volume), three (3) copies (Appendices) and 2 CDs of each.  Proposals should be marked with the above announcement number and addressed to the Aviation Applied Technology  Directorate, ATTN: AMSRD-AMR-AA-C (Pat Hagginbothom), Building 401, Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577. Offerors desiring an explanation or interpretation of this announcement must request it in writing.  Oral explanations or instructions given bef ore the award of any contract/agreement will not be binding. Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning this announcement which is necessary in submitting offers or the lack of which would be prejudicial to any other prospective offeror(s) w ill be transmitted to those prospective offerors who request the supplemental package.  For purposes of this BAA, late proposals will be treated in accordance with FAR 52.215-1.  A copy of any cited reference/clause is available from the issuing office (Pa t Hagginbothom), (757) 878-4818 or via link http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.  Section V.  Application Review Information.  EVALUATION CRITERIA/BASIS FOR AWARD: The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering eval uation of proposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section.  The scientific, technical, and programmatic ability to satisfy the cargo handling requirements as specified in the s upplemental package.  Each of the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance, will be evaluated:  (1) The extent to which the proposal satisfies the topic objectives and JHL Model Performance Specification by use of innovative, efficient,  and affordable solutions to the technical problem. This will include understanding of the problem, current technical barriers, and how the proposed solution eliminates those barriers, and validity of substantiating data to support performance claims.  The  following factors (objectives) will be considered.   Factor a is significantly more important than factor b and factor b is more important than c and d, which are equal.a. Performance (time, people, material handling equipment, and suitability across mission environments) b. Weight  c. Flexibility/Kitability efficiency/penalty and cube d. Payload preparation  (2) The merit of the Offerors proposed approach to de velop and demonstrate the capabilities of proposed technologies.  This includes the reasonableness of the proposed tasks, schedule and technical and management approach to accomplish the scientific and technical objectives. (3) The benefit of the proposed technologies. This includes a clear and reasonable path to transition the technology, as well as the justification for the estimated cost and the overall operational benefits relative to the 2014 metrics. The weight efficiency/penalty of the proposed techn ology and the flexibility of application to a wide variety of mission environments will be considered as part of its ability to effectively transition into service.   (4) The capability of the Offeror to accomplish the proposed effort.  This includes the e xperience and qualifications of the proposed personnel, the suitability of the proposed facilities, and the availability (or the ability to generate) of required technical and test data to validate the technology.  (5) The reasonableness of the proposed co st to the Government. This includes the realism of the proposed man-hours, materials, subcontractors and other costs to accomplish the proposed individual tasks and overall effort.

<DESC>Numbered Note 1 is applicable to this procurement.

The NAICS code to of this solicitation is hereby changed to 332439 with a size of 500 employees. Any business with 500 or less employees qualifies as a small business.

The response time to this solicitation is extended. All responses are due by 10:00 AM EST on March 13, 2008. All offerors shall send their responses electronically via email directly to the Transportation Security Administration, Office of Acquisition, Security Operations Acquisition Division, Narissa Charles, Contract Specialist at Narissa.Charles1@dhs.gov

Below are TSA responses to questions received from potential offerors.

Questions/Responses:

Q1. Please define ?adequate size? to accommodate large working dog. Is the U.S. Army standard acceptable?

R1.  The solicitation allows the offeror to propose a kenneling solution adequate to accommodate a large working dog.  The government would like offerors to provide a unit that they feel will be sufficient.  Offerors are allowed to offer more than one product for the government?s consideration.  The product information provided should include description with size/dimensions.  This information will be evaluated by the government as part of the technical evaluation.


Q2. Please define ?properly insulated?

R2.  The solicitation allows the offeror to propose a kenneling solution with sleep box s adequate to resist temperatures that could pose harm to a dog.  The government would like offerors to provide a unit that they feel will be sufficient.  Offerors are allowed to offer more than one product for the government?s consideration.  The product information provided should include description with capabilities and benefits.  This information will be evaluated by the government as part of the technical evaluation.


Q3.  I have a question about the solicitation that concerns the specification about off the floor.  Your requirement is that the floor should not be resting on the ground?  Does this mean that no part of the floor can contact the ground of that the majority of the floor cannot contact the ground.  This has serious engineering ramifications that could result in increased cost or a proposal that is not competitive if this requirement were clarified

R3.  The kennel should be sufficiently elevated so that as no part of the floor touches the ground. 


Q4.  Is there additional information on the kenneling requirements (size and more detailed specifications)?  If the kennels are used today are there any pictures of their design.  Any help would be appreciated.

R4.  This is a new requirement.  The kennels are not currently being used.  The government would like offerors to provide a unit that they feel will be sufficient.  Offerors are allowed to offer more than one product for the government?s consideration.  The product information provided should include description with capabilities and benefits.  This information will be evaluated by the government as part of the technical evaluation.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide answers to questions received from potential offerors.

1.  The following questions were received:

Q:  Is the requirement only to operate the 9T vertical (solenoid magnet) and 4T horizontal (Split-pair) independently at different times or to achieve both performance (field and homogeneity) simultaneously?

A:  The two magnet coils will be operated simultaneously so that a field of at least 3T can be obtained at any angle. The homogeneity should remain the same (at least 0.5% homogeneity in a 1cm spherical volume).

<DESC>THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWER IS BEING POSTED FOR INFO TO ALL QUOTERS:

QUESTION NO. 1: As I mentioned the manufacturer (FrontRange Solutions) requires that the maintenance period for HEAT products coincide.  I checked with them and they are telling me the maintenance end date for your current system is 10/31/08.  If you are intending to purchase HEAT Plus Knowledge in March 2008, we would charge you maintenance for April 1, 2008 through Oct. 31, 2008 (7 months).  Please let me know if this is what you would like quoted.

ANSWER NO. 1:  Yes, that will be correct.  The maintenance will be then from 1 Apr 2008 through 31 Oct 2008.

<CONTACT>SARAH MUNOZ, 760-380-7035
<DESC>***** THIS COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION HAS BEEN AMMENDED TO CLARIFY VENDOR's QUESTIONS*****PLEASE REVIEW ALL THE REQUIREMENTS*****<BR><BR>SHOWERS & RESTROOM TRAILERS:<BR><BR>1.Can the 144 showers be a different configuration?  Rather that 12 units  of 12 shower stalls,  our configuration includes 12s, 14s, and 16s.  The total number of shower stalls would exceed the required 144.  Would this be acceptable?<BR>The basic requirements stand as is no less than 12 per trailer accepted and must accommodat e as a minimum 144 shower stalls (number of shower heads, stalls and urinals).  The reason for this is because the exercise will be an intensive one where the vast majority of soldiers will use these facilities all at pretty much the same time. There will not be shifts of soldiers using these facilities throughout the day to allow for spreading out the usage requirement.  However, we would not be opposed to different size trailers if they provide the basic requirements (number of shower heads, stalls, urina ls, etc.) but different sizes would need to be reviewed prior to agreeing to accept them to assure they do not conflict with site planning.<BR><BR>2.  Can the 75 toilets be a different configuration?  Instead of 15 trailers with 5 stalls, would you accept 11 trailers with 7 stalls in each?  There would be 15 toilets for females without urinals, and the minimum of 2 sinks per 5 stalls.<BR>We would not be opposed to different size trailers if they provide the basic requirements (number of shower heads, stalls , urinals, etc.) but different sizes would need to be reviewed prior to agreeing to accept them to assure they do not conflict with site planning.<BR> <BR>3.  Will the toilet trailers be located together in order to facilitate multiple trailers being servi ced by one generator instead of each needing an individual gereator?<BR>Yes.<BR> <BR>4.  What is the manpower at FOB New York, what will the potable water truck be servicing and how far is it from FOB Santa Fe?<BR>FOB New York will not be used and should b e eliminated from the specifications.<BR><BR>5.  According to the State of CA,  in order to not contaminate potable water, potable water trucks must be food grade stainless steel with food grade hoses and fittings This is also your requirement, correct?<BR >Yes, the contractor is required to abide by local, state, federal and US military criteria.<BR><BR>6.  Can the potable water trucks be in a different configuration than 3 - 4000 gallon trucks?  We have 2 - 3000 gallons and 1 - 6000 gallon.<BR>Preferably n ot.  But if an offeror proposes such a combination and is the best value or only offeror, then we might want to consider it.<BR><BR>7.  What type of surface will the shower units be set upon?<BR>FOB Santa Fe is generally flat, sandy soil that will require minor grading as determined by the contractor.<BR><BR>8.	What type of connection is used for gray water hookup?<BR>The contractor is responsible for connecting to the leach field for grey water and removing and properly disposing of black water.  The dista nce to the leach fields may vary anywhere from 300 to 500 feet depending on the final laydown of facilities at the site which will be determined with the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) during delivery.  There are standard inlet connections of a pproximately 6 inches to PVC leach field pipes at the site but details are not known to readily answer this question.  The vendor can make a site visit to determine the requirements to connect if needed.<BR><BR>9.	Are contractors required to purchase potab le water or does the government provide the water?<BR>The contractor is responsible for providing, delivering and storage of fresh water.  The contractor will be required to obtain supply water from a water point on Fort Irwin at no cost to the contractor.   The approximate distance is less than 5 miles.  This will be coordinated with the Contracting Officer's Representative.  The flow rate is unknown but it uses an approximate 6 inch fill pipe.<BR><BR>10.

What are the hours of operation for the showers?<BR>Showers will be required to operate 24 hrs per day with scheduled dow ntimes for maintenance for a few shower trailers at a time.<BR><BR>12.	Is there a time during the day when there is a big rush of people who want to shower?<BR>Yes, the exercise will be an intensive one where the vast majority of soldiers will use these fa cilities all at pretty much the same time.  There will not be shifts of soldiers using these facilities throughout the day to allow for spreading out the usage requirement.  However, we would not be opposed to different size trailers if they provide the ba sic requirements (number of shower heads, stalls, urinals, etc.) but different sizes would need to be reviewed prior to agreeing to accept them to assure they do not conflict with site planning.<BR><BR>13.	Are shower personell allowed to stay on base 24 hr s.  per day?<BR>Lodging of contractor personnel is the responsibility of the contractor.

Do you need pictures of the shower facilities?<BR>Not necessary if the offeror meets the requirements but may be helpful in reviewing proposals.<BR><BR>20.	Does per sonnel furnish their own bath towels?<BR>Yes.<BR><BR>21.	Are pillow tanks ok for potable wtaer and gray water storage?  Each of the four trailer units has one 1500 gal. potable water storage and two 1500 gal. gray water storage.<BR>The offeror should check  with the Ft Irwin DPW and environmental offices for acceptability.<BR><BR>22.	What are hours of operation?<BR>24 hrs per day, 7 days a week for the duration of the contract.<BR><BR>23.	I have available 48 shower stalls, two shower trailers with eight show er stalls with private dressing and two shower trailers with sixteen shower stalls with private dressing, for a total of fourty eight shower stalls with private dressing.<BR>All proposals should meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<BR><BR>24. 	Can I make a proposal for these four shower trailers haveing a total of fourty eight showers?<BR>All proposals should meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<BR><BR>25.	Our shower units are built to exceed US Forest Service Specifications for w ildland fire support.<BR><BR>26.	What is the distance to the water fill point for potable water?<BR>The approximate distance is less than 5 miles.<BR> <BR><BR>27.

Can the configuration of the shower heads per trailer change as long as the overall number of heads are provided?<BR><BR>We  would not be opposed to different size trailers if they provide the basic requirements (number of shower heads, etc.) but different sizes would need to be reviewed prior to agreeing to accept them to assure they do not conflict with site planning.<BR><BR> <BR>31.	Is the on board water storage for both fresh and gray water?  <BR>The contractor is responsible for providing, delivering and storage of fresh water.  The contractor will be required to obtain supply water from a water point on Fort Irwin at no cos t to the contractor.  The approximate distance is less than 5 miles.  This will be coordinated with the Contracting Officer's Representative.  Grey water will be drained into leach fields at the site. <BR><BR><BR>32.	What is the storage requirement in # of  gallons for the units to store?  Certain agencies require 20 gallons per person per day, for example.  <BR>The storage requirement is to be determined by the contractor based on the population demands.  The contractor should estimate accordingly.<BR><BR>< BR>33.	Can the configuration of the stalls per trailer change as long as the overall number of stalls are provided?<BR>We would not be opposed to different size trailers if they provide the basic requirements (number of stalls, urinals, etc.) but different  sizes would need to be reviewed prior to agreeing to accept them to assure they do not conflict with site planning.<BR><BR><BR>34.	Is on board water storage for both fresh and gray water?  <BR>The contractor is responsible for providing, delivering and st orage of fresh water.  The contractor will be required to obtain supply water from a water point on Fort Irwin at no cost to the contractor.  The approximate distance is less than 5 miles.

The contractor is responsible for connecting to the leach field for grey water and removing and properly disposing of black water.<BR><BR>37.	Will all the shower units be placed in the same area, and will they be lined up next to each o ther?  This would be most efficient for water delivery and sewer connections.<BR>The current siting plan is to place all units in the same area next to each other; however, when the successful offeror prepares for delivery, he should contact the Contractin g Officer's Representative for final siting requirements.<BR><BR>38.	Will a combination of 6-head and 12-head units providing a total of 144 heads suffice?<BR>We would not be opposed to different size trailers if they provide the basic requirements (number  of shower heads, etc.) but different sizes would need to be reviewed prior to agreeing to accept them to assure they do not conflict with site planning.<BR><BR>39.	To clarify, we're connecting with pipe directly to the leach system for grey water removal.   Therefore there will be no grey water removal, just blackwater?  Approximately how far is the pipe run? <BR>The contractor is responsible for connecting to th e leach field for grey water and removing and properly disposing of black water.  The distance to the leach fields may vary anywhere from 300 to 500 feet depending on the final laydown of facilities at the site which will be determined with the Contracting  Officer's Representative (COR) during delivery.<BR><BR>40.	How far away is the water point we will fill our truck to service the units?

<DESC>***** THIS COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION HAS BEEN AMMENDED TO CLARIFY VENDOR's QUESTIONS*****PLEASE REVIEW ALL THE REQUIREMENTS*****<BR><BR>QUESTION & ANSWERS:<BR><BR>1.	Any information that will clarify locations, distances from one another will re ally help me give the most accurate and economical pricing. Also if you have a site plan with elevations. Clearspans will be sited at FOB Santa Fe.  Exact distances between clearspans will be determined with the Contracting Officer's Representative during installation.  The initial planning was to place the clearspans 10FT to 20FT apart.  There is no site plan; however, FOB Santa Fe is generally flat, sandy soil that will require minor grading as determined by the contractor. Site visit can be coordinated p er request by interested parties.  Maps will be e-maild to those requesting it. <BR><BR>2.	FOB Santa Fe is located how far from Garrison?<BR>FOB Santa Fe is within 2 miles of the Fort Irwin garrison.<BR><BR>3.	Will any of my employees or subcontractors be required to attend the ordnance classes before traveling on the range? If so, is there a cost, how long is the class, and will we need escorts or use radios?<BR>No classes are required.<BR><BR>4.	Does open bay mean a tent with no interior poles (clearspan) ?<BR>Yes.<BR><BR>5.	Can you give us any idea as to how involved the grading needed for the site prep is?<BR>There is no site plan; however, FOB Santa Fe is generally flat, sandy soil that will require minor grading as determined by the contractor.<BR><BR>6 .	What size tables are needed?<BR>There is no specific size requirement.  The contractor should provide appropriate 8FT sized tables to suit the required population.<BR><BR>7.	The solicitation requires A/C.  Are generators also required to power the A/C? If so, do you provide fuel?<BR>See response to question on requirement #3.<BR><BR>8.	I'm not sure what format to use to send in my proposal.<BR><BR>There is not a specific format as long as vendor provide quote breakdown by unit per month, on requirement 1 , 2 & 3 of this solicitation.<BR><BR>9.	In the solicitation it states that HVAC, lights and Electric drops are required is power available or would we need to provide our own power,and fuel?<BR>See response to question on requirement body.<BR><BR>10.	It al so states that Air conditioning duct work shall have manufactured penetrations in the sidewalls could flush mounted AC units be used instead of ducting?<BR>I think this depends on the manufacturers as long as the A/C cooling requirements are met.<BR><BR>11 .	Can the 12 tents be a variety of widths and lengths such 20m and 25m as long as the sqft is met?<BR>Preferably not.  But if an offeror proposes such a combination and is the best value or only offeror, then we might want to consider it.<BR><BR>12.	What s pecifically are the applicable safety equipment required in the structure?  Is this fire extinguishers, exit signs, carbon monoxide/smoke detectors, and fire pull alarms?<BR>See response to question on requirement body.<BR><BR>13.

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment #4 is the following:

1.     The new response date will be set for 2:00pm eastern time on March 17, 2008.     Also the deadline for questions has passed and we will not be accepting further questions.

2.     To address the question(s)/answer(s) below.

Telephone Inventory and Audit Questions

1.Does the government have an application to use for auditing invoices from prior years or is the contractor able to use proprietary software packages to identify variances?     If the government requires the contractor to use a system currently used by the program, please provide the system name.     

The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) does not have an auditing tool or application.     Contractor may use other proprietary systems to perform analysis.     Any data collected for the purpose of this task belongs to the TIGTA and may not be retained by the contractor after completion of analysis.

2.Has this work been performed by a contractor in the past?     If so, please provide the name of the firm. 

TIGTA has not performed this work in the past.

3.Was a sources sought notice advertised for this requirement?     

No we posted on FedBiz a combined Synopsis/Solicitation

4.What is the total amount of in charges for the invoices (fiscal years 2004 - 2008) to be audited?     

At this time this amount is unknown, however, the current expense rate is approximately $120,000 annually.

5.Will line items on prior years' invoices map exactly to the electronic data elements listed in the Task 1 Deliverables Section of the Combined Solicitation?         Or are the invoices including other services (e.g., Electronic Data Interchange, Internet, mobile services)?     

TIGTA?s financial systems do not separate the costs of voice from data. 

6.Is it safe to assume that travel to the various locations will not be necessary?     

This needs to be determined by the contractor and included in the proposal.

7.How many TIGTA assets are associated with the audit?     

If assets refer to the number of telephones, that is the purpose of the contract.     TIGTA does not know what the exact current number of telephone lines is.


8.What is the monthly or annual Telecom spends for services associated with the audit?     

The current monthly expense is approximately $100,000.

9.The solicitation states that payment type for Task #3 is Contingent Fee.     Please provide more detail.     For example, is there a target shared & savings goal?     

There is no target since TIGTA does not know whether or not savings can be achieved.     The contractor shall propose a percent of the savings, which will result in the payment for these services. (Example:     If the contractor recuperates $100,000 in a fiscal year and the proposed compensation percentage is 5%, then the contractor receives $5,000 as payment.)

10.Are their any response requirements regarding page sections, page limits or formatting? 

No requirements or limits have been put into place.     However consideration for pertinent information is requested.

11.What does OMS, INV stand for?     

TIGTA has five major functions.     They are:
IG = Inspector General;
CC = Chief Counsel;
OMS = Office of Mission Support;
Human Capital and Support Services;
Information Technology;
Finance and Accountability;
OI = Office of Investigations (same as INV);
OA = Audit.


12.Should travel expenses be built into the final price?     

Yes


13.Will there be a single point of contact (POC) for the government/TIGTA assigned to ensure that the Contractor is able to obtain Contractor requested data/information from the Government? Or will the Contractor be expected to arrange with each of the 68 locations points of contact in order to gather required data (service provider invoices, contracts, letters of authorization, etc)? This data and the timeliness of receipt of the data are necessary to accomplish the tasks in a timely fashion.

Yes.     There will be a primary and an alternate COTR.     A COTR will be available to provide all necessary data.

14.Can prospective bidders contact the tech rep or single POC at this time to obtain an understanding of how readily available and how well organized data is?

All contact should be made through the BPD Contracting Officer.     Prospective bidders shall not contact the COTR until the contract is awarded.

15.Is there an anticipated % of recovery sharing for task 3 at this time?

No. However, the contractor can propose a specific percent in their offer.

16.Is there any consideration to obtaining savings for go-forward recommendation (documented via task 2) implementations via task 3, or will only potential refunds and recovery for past issues be part of task 3?

TIGTA may consider contracting for these services in the future if recovery/sharing are substantial.


17.Is an on site meeting required as part of the deliverables process?     Or will emailed or regular mailed reports and phone calls be acceptable to the Government?     If on site meetings are required as part of the "reporting" or "deliverable" process, how many meetings will be required and at what addresses/locations will these meetings be held?     We realize that progress reports are required each 60 days and that one-time deliverables are required for tasks 1 and task 2.

Majority of the meetings may be done via teleconference.     However, the following meetings must be on-site meetings:
Initial kick-off meeting;
After the deliverable of task 1;
After the deliverable of task 2;
Post-contract conference. 

On-site meetings will be held at TIGTA, HQ's (1125 15th Street NW, Suite 700A, Washington DC 20005).

18.If as a result of tasks 1 and task 2 little to no recovery is expected, will the Contractor be "required" to pursue task 3? What will the terms of that option be?

The completion of task 3 for fiscal year 04-08 is required.

19.With regard to the "timing" of task 3, and depending upon the nature and dollar amount of potential billing issues and the nature of certain service providers in the telecommunications industry it might be necessary to begin related recovery efforts during tasks 1 and task 2 in order to meet the 12 month from award date requirement. Will the Government entertain that prospect at the Contractors request?     If not - it should be understood that meeting the 12 month deadline may not be possible with regard to some specific issues, as this would potentially only allow a 5-month recovery period. Although many issues can be resolved within 30-90 days, some larger dollar issues have taken over 12 months to completely resolve with a provider.

Yes, the recovery process may be done consecutively.     

20.There was no mention in the solicitation of wireless voice or wireless data services.     Is this not part of the project?

No.

21.What is the Dept of Treasury's current monthly Telecom spenditures?

See question #4.

22.How many paper invoices are received monthly?

TIGTA receives no paper invoices.

23.How many electronic invoices are received monthly?

Approximately 50 invoices are received monthly.

24.What is the current invoice validation process today?     Are invoices reviewed for accuracy prior to submission for payment?

Presently, TIGTA does not have a formal process for validating invoices.     For the most part, after receiving the invoices, we compare current invoices with previous invoices for correctness and consistency.     Whenever necessary, we contact the source provider for clarification of bills.

25.For all Audit projects we ask our clients to provide a list of items that they maybe pursuing for either credit or cost savings (an exclusion list) so that we do not duplicate efforts.     Is this something that you will be providing?

TIGTA does not have an exclusion list at this time.

26.Have there been any recent technology changes?     Is so, please describe.

No.

27.Approximately how many MACD requests are submitted on a monthly basis?

Unknown

28.Is there a central inventory database that can be shared during this project?

No.

29.Are there separate departments for voice and data?     Is the wireless part of these groups or separate?     Please describe the internal IT structure.

Yes.     The Office of Information Technology is responsible for the data lines, and the Office of Support Services and Finance share responsibility for voice lines.

30.Is equipment maintenance part of this project?

No.


31.On Task # 3 (contingency) arrangement:

     We understand the refund and credit process and resulting compensation piece, but have a question on something we think may not have been considered:

As we typically produce many "line-item" recommendations for efficiencies and operational improvements, we deliver the estimated/expected-annualized savings within a detailed report. For example, in Task 2 - we typically derive the same contingency income for our labor in effectuating or implementing any initiatives after the client's approval and concurrence. We verify the results based on a like-for-like comparison of historical cost and each line item initiative is compensated on it's own 12 month life cycle until term end at a predetermined rate of share/percentage.

Will you also consider this additional contingency model (in addition to the refund and credit model) for the method of payment for the necessary labor to implement and deliver the efficiencies and improvements' This model eliminates unsure labor costs; gives client control and approval, and parallels the other contingency phase. 

In our mind, this should be addressed now, rather then trying to figure out how to fund the labor for the implementation needed for obvious positive opportunities from our analysis.

The contractor may propose a contingency arrangement for TIGTA's consideration.

32.Do you have vendor web portal access for your accounts?     If so, what percent of the invoices are accessible thru vendor web portals?

Yes.     Approximately 70% of the invoices are available through vendor web portals.     

33.Exalt typically performs the circuit database creation remotely in our locations.     Are there any restrictions with regards to having invoices and records offsite assuming that all records either obtained from the client or vendors are returned upon completion of the project?

No.     All documentation and data collected by the contractor must be returned to TIGTA. At the end of the contract period, the contractor must provide a written certification that all electronic data has been permanently removed from all contractor systems.     

34.Are services in Task #2 ordered centrally?     Are invoices received centrally or at the various locations nationwide?

In both instances, they are received centrally.

35.Are the interviews going to be with central agency representatives or field office representatives?

There will be a single POC for general data requests.     However, the contractor may be required to follow-up with field offices for clarification and review of data.

36.Is the ultimate goal to provide a recommendation for what type of TEM service: license software, ASP, or BPO?

Yes.

37.Is another goal of Task #2 to provide a roadmap to a TEM RFP?

TIGTA may or may not select to contract for TEM services in the future.

38.Are the chosen vendors able to provide a recommendation of their own TEM services?

Yes, as an unsolicited proposal.

39.What % of services is governed by the GSA schedule?

Approximately 70%

40.What % of services is governed by direct contracts with the vendors?

Approximately 30%

41.What is the current invoice validation process today?     Are invoices reviewed for accuracy prior to submission for payment?

Please see question #25.

42.Have there been any recent technology changes?     If so, please describe.

Please see question #27.

43.Approximately how many MACD requests are submitted on a monthly basis?

Please see question # 28.

44.Is there a central inventory database for voice & data?     Is the wireless part of these groups or separate?     Please describe the internal IT structure.

Please see question # 29.

45.Is equipment maintenance part of the project?

Please see question #31.

46.Where are the records for Task #3 and can they be provided to the Contractor at the Contractor's Office?

The records, assuming the reference is to billing statements, for task #3 are at TIGTA, HQ's.     These records can be made available to the contractor with the stipulation outlined in question# 34.

47.Are you looking for an annual cost or a total cost of the four-year period in Task #3?

An annual cost

48.The first data field in the database is Telephone Inventory, are you wanting a physical count of all device types or just the quantity of telephones?

The first data field of the "Telephone Inventory" is "Telephone Number."     TIGTA is seeking to know the exact number of lines in existence.     Although TIGTA did not request the device type, however this could be an additional field included in the database.

49.Please identify offices located within facilities sharing telecommunications systems and offices that have their own telecommunications systems.

We cannot provide this information at this time; however, this information can be made available at a later date.

50.Please identify offices that utilize VoIP systems.

TIGTA cannot specifically identify these offices, however, some TIGTA offices may be sharing IRS VoIP systems.

51.In cases where all three requirements, are the audit and investigations the same employees?     Additionally, who determines which should be included in the various categories?

No.     TIGTA has 5 major functions (please see question #11) and all functions must be included.

52.Will you provide the name of your current telecommunications vendor(s) and the Contract Vehicle used to procure current services?

Yes.

53.Do you have centralized regions or a nationwide system using VoIP or consolidated voice/data services such as MPLS?

No.     Please see question# 54.

54.Do you have a centralized voice mail system?

No.     This needs to be identified by the contractor as part of the deliverable of Task 1.

55.What is the method currently used for telecommunications inventory and control?

None

56.Will you allow the successful vendor access to your current inventory and control information?

Yes.

57.How do you receive your billing data - paper, magnetic tape or CD ROM?

Please see questions #23 and #24.

58.If telecommunications services were purchased under the FTS Crossover Contract what biller is being used for local services (i.e. Martin Biller, ISB)?

Unknown.  Presently, TIGTA bills are received from GSA TOPS and BPD.

Cover with polyethylene sheets a minimum of 6 mils thick per ASTM C 171.<BR><BR>b.  Cover  with burlap or other absorptive material and keep continually moist.<BR><BR>c.  Use of a membrane-curing compound applied at a rate not to exceed 200 square ft/gallon, or per manufacturers' recommendations according to ASTM C 309.<BR><BR>6.2.3.2   Curing with Heat and Moisture<BR><BR>Do not subject concrete to steam or hot air until after the concrete has attained its initial set.  Apply steam, if used, within a suitable enclosure, which permits free circulation of the steam in accordance with CAN/CSA A23. 4.  If hot air is used for curing, take precautions to prevent moisture loss from the concrete.  The temperature of the concrete shall not be permitted to exceed 150 degrees F.  These requirements do not apply to products cured with steam under pressure in  an autoclave.<BR><BR>6.2.4   Surface Finish<BR><BR>Finish unformed surfaces of wet-cast precast concrete products as specified.  If no finishing procedure is specified, finish such surfaces using a strike-off to level the concrete with the top of the form .<BR><BR>6.2.4.1   Formed Non-Architectural Surfaces<BR><BR>Cast surfaces against approved forms following industry practices in cleaning forms, designing concrete mixes, placing and curing concrete.  Normal color variations, form joint marks, small surfac e holes caused by air bubbles, and minor chips and spalls will be accepted but no major imperfections, honeycombs or other major defects will be permitted.<BR><BR>6.2.5   Stripping Products from Forms<BR><BR>Do not remove products from the forms until the concrete reaches the compressive strength for stripping required by the design.  If no such requirement exists, products may be removed from the forms after the final set of concrete provided that stripping damage is minimal.<BR><BR>6.2.6   Patching and Re pair<BR><BR>No repair is required to formed surfaces that are relatively free of air voids and honeycombed areas, unless the surfaces are required by the design to be finished.<BR><BR>6.2.6.1   Repairing Minor Defects<BR><BR>Defects that will not impair th e functional use or expected life of a precast concrete product may be repaired by any method that does not impair the product.<BR><BR>6.2.6.2   Repairing Honeycombed Areas<BR><BR>When honeycombed areas are to be repaired, remove all loose material and cut  back the areas into essentially horizontal or vertical planes to a depth at which coarse aggregate particles break under chipping rather than being dislodged.  Use proprietary repair materials in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.  If a prop rietary repair material is not used, saturate the area with water.  Immediately prior to repair, the area should be damp, but free of excess water.  Apply a cement-sand grout or an approved bonding agent to the chipped surfaces, followed immediately by con solidating an appropriate repair material into the cavity.<BR><BR>6.2.6.3   Repairing Major Defects<BR><BR>Evaluate, by qualified personnel, defects in precast concrete products which impair the functional use or the expected life of products to determine if repairs are feasible and, if so, to establish the repair procedure.<BR><BR>6.2.7   Shipping Products<BR><BR>Do not ship products until they are at least 5 days old, unless it can be shown that the concrete strength has reached at least 75% of the specif ied 28-day strength, or that damage will not result, impairing the performance of the product.
