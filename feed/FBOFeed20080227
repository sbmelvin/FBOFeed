<DESC>Market Survey Capability Assessment for AWOS Data Collection Platform Project - Wire This is a market survey for Wire to be used in the AWOS Data Collection Platform Project.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore, any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors' expense. At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  This market survey is being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.  The total estimated price for the requirement is $8,560.50. The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest from companies with the capability of providing the wire listed on Attachment 1.   The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 331422 Copper Wire (except mechanical) Drawing, the size standard is 1,000 employees.    In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors: 1.  Complete the attached Business Declaration form, 2.  Copy of SBA 8(a) certification letters, if applicable. 3.  Copy of catalog or price list for items on Attachment 1.   4. Capability Statement - This document should identify:      (a) special agreements with vendors,       (b) pricing information, i.e. catalog availability, quantity discounts available to the government, etc.      (c) list of exceptions to the part numbers provided Attachment 1 is a list of all anticipated requirements for wire.  Respondents are encouraged to review this list of parts and provide comments.   All responses to this market survey must be received by 14 Mar 2008.   All submittals should be submitted via email to:  michelle.shaw@faa.gov.  No phone calls will be accepted.

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR  6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. First article test required. Basic one year period and four one year options. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This part required engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part.  Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s).  The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part.  An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.  The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. See Note(s) 1, 25 and 26.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to announce Naval Air Systems Command?s (NAVAIR) intention to conduct a full and open competition to procure a Joint and Allied Threat Awareness System (JATAS).  The objective of the JATAS effort is to develop a cost effective threat awareness system to enhance aircraft survivability by providing advanced missile warning capability; aircrew warning of laser-based weapon systems such as range finders, illuminators, and beam riders; and a Hostile Fire Indication for small arms, rockets, and other threats.  JATAS must interface with existing AN/ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispensing System (CMDS), and be capable of interfacing with a laser based Directed Infrared Countermeasure as part of electronic countermeasures response to attacking infrared missiles.  The JATAS will be controlled by the host aircraft?s mission computer with operator interface/control being accomplished via the multifunctional display or a separate control indicator.  In most cases, command and control of the JATAS will be through the AN/APR-39A/B(V)2 Radar Signal Detecting Set (RSDS).

This anticipated JATAS System Development Demonstration (SDD) contract will include supporting the integration of JATAS onto the MV-22B lead platform and developing the interfaces necessary to deploy JATAS to other rotary wing platforms.  The JATAS SDD effort will include (but not be limited to) the fabrication of test articles, support for aircraft integration testing and Systems Integration Laboratory Development, support for live fire testing, and providing support for attendant data reduction for the integration/live fire tests.  The JATAS SDD contractor will develop supporting logistics documentation, support the definition of software sustainment requirements and software facility development, and conduct program management, engineering management, and configuration management throughout the JATAS program.

NAVAIR will only release the Solicitation/RFP, including any subsequent amendments, over the Internet. NAVAIR will post the Solicitation/RFP and all amendments on the NAVAIR home page.  The RFP will not be posted on any other WEB site.  The NAVAIR Homepage is located at http://www.navair.navy.mil and can be accessed using Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI), NOT A SOLICITATION

CDC Information and Management Services (CIMS) Contract

Request for Information (RFI)

February 27, 2008

Introduction - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is seeking industry feedback on a range of issues as it formulates its sourcing strategy and request for proposals for the next generation contract supporting CDC's information resources program.  This next generation contract will be a successor to the current CDC Information Technology Services (CITS 2) contract, but it may expand to include functions and activities that are outside the current CITS scope and are provided through other contracts currently.  The current CITS 2 contract expires October 2010 but the successor contract should be awarded several months prior to facilitate an effective contract transition.  A rough estimate of the contract magnitude is 2-3 million labor hours per year and will be primarily for management and information resources services not the acquisition of commercial IT hardware and software.  

Current CITS Scope

The following general functions are covered in the current CITS contract which is a multiple award contract held by two large IT providers and several subcontractor partners:

IT research, planning, consulting, advising, economic analysis, evaluation, and testing; business process re-engineering and process modeling; information systems life cycle management including planning, design, development, project management, implementation, transition, integration, operations, maintenance, and retirement; information technology architecture planning; system engineering; computer facility operations; technical writing and editing of system and user documentation; IV&V, QA, QC and other related services; Internet, Web, and other platform content development and management; IT orientation, training, and education; help desk and user support operations; statistical analysis and other analytic support (in the IT arena); data warehousing, data mining, standards development, visualization, GIS, data entry, and other related data services; information security, disaster recovery, continuity of operations planning, critical infrastructure protection, vulnerability and risk assessments, penetration testing; and other related support services.

These services are commissioned as needed via competitive task orders with the current contractors.  Typically, these services are rendered as part of a contractor-government staffing solution, i.e. blended workforce or staff augmentation rather than a full outsourcing of the work.  In some instances, specific projects are entirely tasked to the contractor with government oversight provided.

Background - As the world's leading public health agency, CDC has the responsibility for promoting health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury and disability. CDC works with States, local public health agencies and partners throughout the Nation and the world to accomplish this mission. CDC serves as the national focus for developing and applying disease prevention and control, environmental health, and the health promotion and education activities designed to improve the health of the people of the United States and throughout the world.  While CDC has broad and deep expertise and program responsibilities for hundreds of diseases, health conditions, and health risks, CDC is also focusing on more integrated approaches to health improvement, wellness, and health system transformation through its health protection goals.  (see www.cdc.gov). 

CDC is an information-intensive organization across the spectrum of health monitoring, research, analytics, and information communication to improve health.  Consequently, CDC's dependence on information technology (IT), information systems, electronic communications, and digital media continues to grow rapidly and is essential to the mission and program accomplishment.  Scientific credibility and service are the characteristics for which CDC is best known and most widely appreciated.  Maintaining this edge in an era of information explosion is critical to CDC.  CDC has developed strategies to use information technology to effectively and efficiently facilitate the mission, while protecting the integrity and confidentially of its information resources.  CDC's latest IT Strategic Plan can be found at:  www.cdc.gov/ocio. 

CDC has been contracting for enterprise information systems development and other IT service support since the mid 1980s and each contract has expanded dramatically as CDC's scope and programs have grown.  Similarly CDC has expanded its use of management consulting services in the last decade and frequently these services have involved IT, systems, and data management/analysis functions.

Instructions - CDC appreciates industry feedback on any or all of the following questions.  Responses should be sent to the following email address:  CIMS@cdc.gov no later than April 18, 2008.  Please limit responses to any question to no more than 1 page.  Responses should be in Microsoft Office product format (e.g. Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc).  Responses will be kept confidential.  Response or non-response to this RFI will have no bearing on the standing of any proposer in subsequent solicitations.  

The sole purpose of this RFI is to assist CDC in understanding the service provider landscape, identify good ideas and strategies, and avoid solicitation or contracting parameters which would be detrimental to CDC's mission or industry's ability to provide innovative and cost-effective solutions.  CDC does not plan to respond back to companies that submit responses to this RFI except perhaps to ask a clarifying question regarding a response provided by a company.

Industry Questions

1.	SCOPE:  Management consulting has typically been outside the scope of previous information services contracts at CDC; however, more and more management consulting engagements involve information systems, analytics, or other information resource aspects.  Should CIMS cover more traditional management consulting functions in its scope?  Please describe major advantages or disadvantages.

2.	SCOPE:  CDC has historically acquired IT infrastructure services (e.g. networking, telecommunications, desktop support, hardware repair and maintenance, helpdesk, server and storage management, data center operations, etc) under a different contract and solicitation.  What would be the advantages and disadvantages of combining those services into this solicitation?

3.	SCOPE:  Are there other functions beyond those already noted that should be added to the CIMS scope either because they are related services or they are directions that the industry predicts will become more germane to this domain area in the future.

4.	SOURCING:  CDC has a history of making a single or dual source contract award for these services; should CDC consider a different approach for this solicitation given its size, breadth, heterogeneity of services, and the federal landscape of multiple award contracts?

5.	SOURCING:  How should CDC best incorporate small businesses into the sourcing strategy including special categories such as women-owned, veteran-owned, small disadvantaged, HubZone, etc?  

6.	SOURCING:  What strategies should CDC employ in the solicitation to assist in a Best Value award determination?  What techniques have worked well in other solicitations?

7.	OFF-SHORING:  Should CIMS enable or prohibit off-shoring of work in whole or in part and which functions in particular?  If it should be enabled, what strategies should CDC employ in the contract terms and conditions to ensure:  a) national interests and sensitive information are protected, b) quality and reliability is high, c) methodologies and techniques are aligned with CDC and federal practices and standards?

8.	PERFORMANCE-BASED CONTRACTING:  What techniques have worked well in other similar contracts or what type of performance-based strategies would you recommend for these types of services?

9.	OTHER:  Any other suggestions or ideas for CDC to consider in this solicitation?

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to University Research Glassware Co Inc, dba U R G, located at 116 S Merritt Mill Rd in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, 27516, for the acquisition of a U R G laboratory instrument upgrade.   Upgrade from an Anion Particle and Gas Sampler configuration (URG-9000C) to an Anion and Cation Particle and Gas Sampler configuration (URG-9000D).  The upgrade involves (i) upgrading the manufacturer's proprietary integration software to  control additional sampling and analysis functions, (ii) reconfiguring the instrument with an additional Rheodyne valve and upgrading a custom syringe pump, and (iii) providing an additional reagent free ion chromatography (IC) system with a custom imbedded chip to allow two-way communication with  the AIM 9000 control software.  U R G has exclusive copyrights, patents, and/or trade secret ownership; and, therefore, is the only vendor that can satisfy the requirement.  In order to ensure correct instrument operation, the circumstance permitting is FAR 13.106(b) (1) "only one source reasonably  available".  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist; and, therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to demonstrate the contractor's ability to provide the U R G instrument upgrade and instead choosing merely to submit a routine  letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability, no  later than 15 days after the date of this publication. Submit your response to:  the U.S. EPA, Attn:  Barbara L. Mattison (MC-E105-02), 109 T.W.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the interim infrastructure solution of the project.  The acquisition of the specified Stonegate, Cisco, and ISS Proventia hardware products are necessary to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of this infrastructure. During the Joint Management Council (JMC) meeting held on July 25th, 2007, the IT JPMO was tasked to deploy an IT infrastructure at the Tier 1 consolidation posts to support IT as a shared service. To address this new direction the IT JPMO has developed an interim IT infrastructure solution using the industrys best practices.   Technically the selected solution is very similar to the current connection that exists between the two networks domestically. That IT infrastructure was selected because it would enable the majority of the pre-determined official applications in use, and since the design is already active domestically a new complete risk analysis and adjudication would not be necessary, which would have added considerable time to the schedule.  Security requirements for USAID and DoS were identified and used in this infrastructure design.  Specific components within the infrastructure were chosen by the engineers based on USAID and Diplomatic Security requirements, the ability of the compatibility of the components within existing systems and overall performance.   The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. The products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the DoS (Diplomatic Security) and USAID security requirements as a key component of this infrastructure. As this is a brand name only justifications, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the DoS and USAID security requirements as a key component of this infrastructure.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of StoneGate Firewall Equipment. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the StoneGate Firewall devices as a key component of the Department's OpenNet Everywhere (ONE) networking server farm. The equipment listed above is required to provide secure, firewalled protected access to the OpenNet Citrix Farm by providing application level access to IT resources on OpenNet. The Stonegate Firewall devices are essential to the State Department's requirements for maximum network protection and utilization of the network security infrastructure on and off site. The 41 USC 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's ONE networking infrastructure.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The text of page page 5 in the solicitation regarding Dining Facilities is missing language as a result of a clerical error. Paragraph should read as follows:

Dining Facilities in Hotel Proximity: During the time that the guests are in the hotel, CBP is responsible for ensuring that regular needs are met during business and non-business hours. The hotel must have a full-service restaurant, open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, seven days per week, either inside the hotel or no more than 150' from its main entrance. To reduce the logistical burdens associated with arranging meals during non-course hours, additional full service eating facilities or restaurants must be within 3 blocks (short walking distance).    A variety of restaurants is preferred because the diversity of nationalities participating in the events implies the possibility of dietary restrictions/needs. 
  
The language above, consistent with past acquisitions for CBP's IACIT event requirements, is now incorporated into the solicitation. 

Amendment A0001 is issued to make this change. A copy of the amendment has been uploaded at this site and is available for download.

The quotation due date and time is extended until 2/29/2008, 9:00am, Dallas local time.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<CONTACT>Dr. Adriana C. Ocampo, NF Program Executive, Phone 202-358-2152, Fax 202-358-3097, Email aco@nasa.gov
<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled NASA OFFERS PRE-SCREENING OF PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW FRONTIERS OPPORTUNITY which was posted on January 23, 2008.   NASA OFFERS PRE-SCREENING OF PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR REVISED REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW FRONTIERS OPPORTUNITY The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) plans to release an Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for the third New Frontiers (NF-3) mission no earlier than June 2008. Downselection would occur in 2009. This NF-3 AO will solicit only missions that do not require nuclear sources for power generation or propulsion. Once the National Research Council's (NRC's) New Opportunities for Solar System Exploration (NOSSE) committee reports to NASA on mid decade NF science mission priorities in March 2008, NASA plans to release more details about allowed targets for the upcoming NF-3 AO. This AO will be announced through both the Federal Business Opportunity website and the SMD email distribution list (register at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/  ). In compliance with SMD policy, the Principal Investigators (PI) for a NF-3 mission must demonstrate minimum experience qualifications that are designed to demonstrate relevant experience exercising responsibility, authority, and management of a space project in the areas of leadership, planning, implementation, and approval. In order to facilitate the creation of teams who plan to respond to the forthcoming NF-3 AO, SMD offers the opportunity of pre-screening the experience qualifications of prospective investigators against the PI minimum experience requirement for large class missions. NF-3 missions are in the large mission class and have more stringent requirements than medium class or small class missions. Proposed NF-3 investigations that are led by PIs lacking in demonstrated, relevant, and appropriate experience sufficient to meet these requirements will be found noncompliant and will neither be reviewed nor selected. The PI minimum experience requirements applicable to NF-3 are those for large missions as described in the SMD policy document available at the NF Acquisition Additional Information Page at http://newfrontiers.larc.nasa.gov/	 .  The requirements released on January 23, 2008, were revised on February 19, 2008. Investigators desiring pre-screening against the PI minimum experience requirements for NF-3 may submit a completed copy of the PI Space Flight Experience Table. A copy of the table as well as instructions for completing and submitting it are available at the NF Acquisition Additional Information web page at http://newfrontiers.larc.nasa.gov/   .  NASA is offering this opportunity as a service to prospective PIs. A request for pre-screening is voluntary and is not required by NASA. However, it is important to realize that proposed NF-3 investigations that are led by PIs lacking in demonstrated, relevant, and appropriate experience sufficient to meet these requirements will be declared noncompliant and will not be reviewed or selected. It is the intent of NASA to also offer the pre-screening opportunity after release of the final NF-3 AO. In response to the request for pre-screening, NASA will inform the investigator that their response is, or is not, sufficient to demonstrate that the PI minimum experience requirements have been met. For submissions that do not adequately demonstrate that the PI minimum experience requirements have been met, NASA will indicate which component of the PI minimum experience requirements has not been demonstrated by the submission. NASA?s response will be through an email to the submitter, which will contain specific comments explaining NASA?s response, and/or requests for clarification. If the table documenting the PI qualifications passes the pre-screening, then this same table will be adequate to comply with the PI minimum experience requirements for the NF-3 AO. In this case the table must be included in the NF-3 proposal. Release of the NF-3 AO is in the process of formally being approved by NASA. However, by offering this service to prospective investigators at this time (prior to release), NASA is under no obligation to issue the AO and solicit proposals. Any costs incurred by prospective investigators in preparing submissions in response to this invitation are incurred completely at the submitter's own risk.  NASA will conduct screenings twice a month from March until April of 2008, inclusive. In general, submissions received by the first or third Monday of the month will receive a response from NASA within 10 days. The response to the first submission has been delayed because the PI minimum experience requirements were being revised. NASA will conduct screenings once a month from May until September of 2008, inclusive. Submissions received by the first Monday of the month will receive a response from NASA within three weeks. Additional opportunities will be announced in the NF-3 AO. Questions may be addressed to Dr. Adriana C. Ocampo, NF Program Executive, Science Mission Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC 20546; Tel.: (202) 358-2152; Email: aco@nasa.gov.

<DESC>The following questions have been raised by a potential offeror.  In an effort to insure that all potential offerors have the same information from the Government, responses to the potential offeror's are provided herewith: Question #1: How does an interested prospective offeror acquire the TDP to be in compliance with the listed specifications for the M16A4? Government Answer: At solicitation issue, every interested prospective offeror will be directed to submit a pair of Non-Disclosure Agreements, as the end item is subject to proprietary licensing agreements between the US Government and two suppliers.  Once I receive properly  completed Non-Disclosure Statements endorsed by a representative authorized to bind prospective offerors, I will direct that the Technical Data Package (TDP) be sent on CD-Rom via surface mail.  If a potential offeror desires to have the mailing of this T DP expedited, potential offerors should include their FEDEX Account # when submitting a properly completed Non-Disclosure statement(s). Question #2: Are there any deviations permitted to the specs? Government Answer: No.  Every offeror must quote to the Government specification(s) as published.  Potential offerors cannot quote assuming that the Government would approve of any request for deviation (RFD) as submitted by an offeror.  During the open solicitation period, engineering questions raised by potential offerors are encouraged and will be published as Questions and Answers in the form of material amendments to the solicitation.  This process alerts ALL potential offerors to information that could affect how a pote ntial offeror responds to both non-price and pricing-related solicitation requirements. However, if an offeror becomes a subsequent awardee and then finds the necessity to submit a Request for Deviation following award, there is a method in place to support that process. Question #3: The solicitation release date has been modified to July 31, 2007.  Is this the date when we may begin to send the necessary documentation for this solicitation? Government Answer: The solicitation release date as announced on FedBizOpps is an ESTIMATED release date.  If you have already activated the automatic email notification that FedBizOpps allows in connection with any solicitation, you will receive automatic notification of th e solicitation release.  The Government does not maintain an interested bidder list, and it is incumbent on industry to monitor our Open Solicitation website for the actual publication of the solicitation. On issue, potential offerors may download the solicitation and its associated attachments.  It is at that point that potential offerors can submit their properly completed Non-Disclosure Statements (see Question/Answer #1). Question #4: When does the solicitation close? Government Answer: The solicitation will carry a clear closing date when issued.  That date will be NO LESS than thirty days from the original issue date.  Potential offerors are strongly encouraged to continuously monitor our Open Solicitation website for material amendment s that may be published while the solicitation is open for industry response.  Some of these amendments may extend the original closing date. NOTE 2 applies.

Description	


The National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducts the world?s largest biomedical research program.  In support of, and critical to this program, NIH uses a large quantity and variety of property items, including everything from simple furniture and supply items through sophisticated, multimillion dollar, state of the art, medical test equipment.  The Division of Personal Property Services (DPPS) is responsible for assuring NIH obtains the best value for its personal property expenditures.  It does this by providing direction for the appropriate control, management and use of the property.   DPPS provides management direction to the NIH Institutes and Centers through policy development and issuance.  DPPS maintains accountability systems for NIH and tests the efficacy of data in those systems through regular inventories.  DPPS manages property reutilization and disposal activities to assure that, not only NIH, but the taxpayer can be sure that property is used to the greatest extent possible and disposed of appropriately.

NIH core business hours are between 9:30 AM and 11:30 AM and 1:30 PM and 3:30 PM, Monday through Friday, exclusive of Federal holidays. Standard work hours for NIH activities are from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM.  DPPS activities operate between the hours of 7:30 AM and 4:00 PM, dependent upon the operational needs of the activity.

The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002, outlines requirements to secure Federal information.  Each Federal Agency, including contractors or other organizations who work with the agency, must develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program.  The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) provides detailed guidance and recommendations for FISMA compliance. The National Institute for Standards and Technology guidelines encompass all aspects of information security.

In addition, to submitting a response to the Sources Sought, businesses can voluntarily?  Register as Interested Vendor?  On the Federal Business Opportunities website in order to promote teaming and/or prime and subcontractor relationships.

History:

The Standard Data Processing System (SDPS) consists of many data and reporting requirements that have been designed and developed in response to the ongoing ADP requirements of the various QIOs and other affiliated partners, such as the Clinical Data Abstraction Center (CDAC) to fulfill its contractual requirements with CMS.  This system, which became operational is May 1997, interfaces with CMS Central Office, 53 QIOs and CDAC.  Through the SDPS, the QIOs have a database of current Part A claims data, ad-hoc capability to access Part B data, access to national data sets, software tools for data analysis, report generation tools, and project information.

The Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) are critical elements of the SDPS project within QualityNet.  The SDPS is administrated by CMS, and is designed to monitor and improve utilization and quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries.  The QIO network infrastructure is comprised of a national network of fifty-three (53) QIOs responsible for each U.S. state, territory, and the District of Columbia.  Each QIO maintains a staff of mutli-disciplinary experts in medicine, quality improvement, health information management, IT Systems Security, Statistical analysis, computer programming and operations, communications, public relations, and clerical/administrative support.  The QIO network structures are configured identically with Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and are managed and supported by CMS IT support contractors.

Historically, the QIO organizations were exempt from meeting the FISMA standards.  But, with the increasing threat to Identity Theft and the OMB mandates to strengthen the security posture of the Federal Information Systems that contain sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII), CMS can no longer accept the risk.  The QIO organizations must now move towards FISMA compliance.

The goal is to quantify and document the existing security posture of the QIO organizations from a FISMA compliance standpoint.

BACKGROUND
________________________________________________________________
Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA): 
http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/m03-19.pdf 

The ability to provide an IT Security Audit of an organization/facility that will determine if that organization is in compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002, outlines requirements to secure Federal information. Each Federal Agency, including contractors or other organizations who work with the agency, must develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program. The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) provides detailed guidance and recommendations for FISMA compliance. NIST guidelines encompass all aspects of information security.

FISMA sections 3544 and 3505 require the following: 

Compliance for every IT system? Required identification of all systems in use and that access federal information, and validation of their compliance. To help aid agencies in obtaining this, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has released a series of guidelines, checklists, and templates that detail acceptable configurations for systems. 

Risk Assessment: The agency must have an agency-wide information security program that includes controls and checks to ensure effectiveness, including reporting on existing risks and responses. 

Incident response: The NIST Controls document outlines specific steps to follow and functions to perform depending on the level of threat posed by the environment. 

Intrusion detection: Requires reporting on cyber security, risks and responses. 

Boundary protection: Systems and applications should be protected from unauthorized access, both from outside the agency and its contractors, and from within. 

Compliance Reporting: Requires detailed reporting on FISMA compliance status. 
 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) - Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and Special Publication (SP) Series (800 Series):
http://www.nist.gov/ 
http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/by-num.htm
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html 

NIST has issued FIPS 200 - Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems in March 2006 that mandates NIST Special Publication 800-53 Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems as a federal requirement. The CMS Information System (IS) Acceptable Risks and Safeguards (ARS) document - http://www.cms.hhs.gov/InformationSecurity/14_Standards.asp#TopOfPage, was developed in response to FIPS 200 and is the companion document to the NIST SP 800-53, establishes the minimum set of security controls a federal information system must meet from the approved set of CMS security controls identified for each security level.

FISMA Security Audits:

The FISMA annual security audit requirement of Federal Information Systems as prescribed in NIST Special Publication 800-53 Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, require that:

Periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security policies, procedures, practices, and security controls to be performed with a frequency depending on risk, but no less than annually. 

The security audit of an organization that supports a Federal Information System will need to follow the NIST Special Publication 800-53 a DRAFT Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html) and FEDERAL INFORMATION
SYSTEM CONTROLS AUDIT MANUAL (FISCAM) - (www.gao.gov/special.pubs/ai12.19.6.pdf) as the baseline to establish the security audit criteria that the organization will be evaluated against. 

The business will be required to provide for: 
o	Development of FISMA baseline audit criteria and documentation;
o	Training of Auditors; 
o	Perform QIO security audit site visits;
o	Capability of visiting each of the 53 QIO facilities, 2 times over a 3 year period; 
o	Documentation of findings/weaknesses; 
o	Document FISMA compliance level and risk(s) at each QIO facility; 
o	Report detail findings to CMS via the CMS Contractor Integrated Security Suite (CISS) tool? see http://www.cms.hhs.gov/InformationSecurity/70_Guidelines_Tools.asp#TopOfPage;  
o	Track activity of findings from initial site visit to follow-up site visit;
o	Manage the milestone status of the findings and maintenance of the documented report findings via the CMS Contractor Integrated Security Suite (CISS) tool;
o	Provide an update of status of the Corrective Action Plans (CAPS) Monthly updates;
o	Input updated information into the CMS Contractor Integrated Security Suite (CISS) tool Monthly updates;
o	Produce the monthly Project of Action & Milestones (POA&M) update from the CISS tool for submission to CMS Office of Information Services (OIS);
o	Produce a FINAL report detailing the estimated cost and actual weaknesses identified for each QIO, including a grand total for the entire report, for the weaknesses that could not be addressed under the current 9th SOW QIO contract.

Electric Wire, Power and Distribution Equipment Contracting Office Address Department of the Navy, United States Marine Corps, Marine Corps Systems Command, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA, 22134-5060 Description The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Virginia seeks sources and information for a new family of Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) for use with multiple tactical and combat vehicle platforms.  Previous efforts to develop APUs have been system specific and as such have not found widespread use.  As power requirements for vehicles continue to increase, a source of readily available, highly reliable, rugged APUs must be identified. The goal of this program is to identify APUs in two size ranges: 3.5-5kW and 10-15kW at 28 VDC. The APUs must be capable of sustained operation in temperatures ranging from -20 degrees F to +125 degrees F. All APUs must operate on tactical fuels (diesel, JP-8), and can not be driven by the vehicle?s primary engine.  APU may utilize the vehicles fuel tank and batteries.   Commercial firms possessing the characteristics noted in any of the above systems are encouraged and invited to submit product brochures and pricing materials outlining specifications, to include a statement of capabilities. Responses will be reviewed to identify firms potentially capable of fulfilling the Governments requirements. This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes in preparation for a Request for Proposal to be released in the Spring of 2008.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or otherwise pay for the information requested. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort. If so included, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. Responses to this RFI shall be mailed to Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn: Moxi Mi-GTES, 2200 Lester Ave, Quantico, VA 22134-6050 no later than 31 Mar, 2008.

<DESC>NOAA's Acquisition & Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, is seeking sources for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Charpy V-Notch Verification Program. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

The Charpy V-Notch Verification Program seeks Contractors to machine and heat treat Super-High Charpy Specimens (SRM) 2092, SRM 2096 and SRM 2098 indirect verification specimens.  These SRM's are used to perform indirect verification of Charpy V-Notch impact machines for ASTM E23. A total of 8 to 10 batches of SRM's are produced per year (10,000 to 12,000 specimens). To control the quality of these SRMs the contractors used for this work must be qualified according to the NIST Manufacturing Qualification Program Policy. The variation in impact energy allowed for the specimens is small, and it is difficult to consistently achieve the quality required by the program. To control the quality of these SRMs the vendors used for this work are pre-qualified according to NIST Manufacturing Qualification Program Policy. Qualification typically takes several months to a year to complete, in which the contractor first demonstrates machining quality on 50 specimens and then heat treats and machines a qualification batch of 300 specimens for each SRM of interest.  The variation in impact energy allowed for the specimens is small, and it is difficult to consistently achieve the quality required by the program. 

This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  The Government may solicit for proposals in the future. Firms that believe they can provide this service or that are interested in the Charpy V-Notch Verification Program may submit a qualification statement in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

The work shall be performed in accordance with the Coast Guard Standard Repair Specification that will be attached to the solicitation.  It is the Government's belief that only Curtiss-Wright and or their authorized distributors can provide the services for the pumps.  However, other potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities can submit such data discussing the same in duplicate within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  The following information must be provided to evaluate the acceptability of the offered services: 1) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered services (i.e. salient physical, functional and serviceability characteristics), or 2) Data that the offered service has been satisfactorily manufactured for the government or the original equipment manufacturer. Technical data and/or drawings pertaining to the pumps are not available within the Government and are proprietary to Curtiss-Wright EMC.  Accordingly, it is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard ELC from obtaining competition as the pumps are available from Curtiss-Wright EMC and or their authorized distributors.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capabilities to supply or overhaul the pumps for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard ELC to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Other concerns having the expertise and required complete information discussing capabilities are invited to submit complete information discussing capabilities in duplicate within 15 days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing information is required.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited.  Responses must be concise and be specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above.  Contractors that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate their capabilities to meet the requirements.

<DESC>Market research is being conducted to determine the availability of Alaska yellow cedar lumber.  The Chugach National Forest has identified yellow cedar as the desired material for picnic tables, kiosks and other uses where the elements are exposed to the weather and are also in contact with people.  The reason for this decision is because the wood is easy to work with, is very durable, does not require special treatments or chemicals and weathers to a beautiful gray.  The purpose of this market research is to determine if there are any seasonal variations in availability or supply of lumber, any lead times required for delivery, if there is an optimal time to order or if there is any minimum quantity for ordering. Submit responses to Denise Murphy, Contract Specialist, at denisemurphy@fs.fed.us or fax to 907-743-9492.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN), Charleston, is soliciting information from potential sources to provide the following: The Marine Corps has established signals intelligence (SIGINT) training and Electronic Warfare (EW) Training to provide support to the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) operations to the three Radio Battalions as well as the Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC). The MAGTF Commanders are required to have highly technical and competently trained SIGINT and EW Marines. Rapid advances in technology coupled with limited training resources within traditional, formal schools have created a training void for Marines working within the SIGINT and EW fields. Current established SIGINT training has provided a realistic training environment where units conduct SIGINT and EW missions to pursue mission capable combat operations. This training has provided an environment and a means to train with live signals allowing them to employ Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) that cannot be emulated within formal schools. Marine electronic attack squadrons (VMAQ), Radio Battalions, and MARSOC units train and participate in multiple exercises. Historically, they have benefited from the services of unique units, known as Red Teams, which provide specialized training of a classified nature to include classified scenario training. This training has been tailored to specific areas of the world and to specific threats in the global war on terrorism.  This task will provide Red Team training on a regular, vice sporadic, basis to each class at Marine Air Wing Training Center (MAWTC-1), each Radio Battalion and MARSOC unit preparing for deployment within all levels of the MAGTF. The contractor shall provide support and instruction using telecommunications technology and scripting that emulates, as closely as possible, the signal environment in which the supported, deploying unit would operate, in order to produce personnel who can effectively and proficiently employ current SIGINT and EW TTPs. All EW / SIGINT equipment required to properly and effectively conduct the required training in accordance with this request. In order to properly meet these particular requirements, the responding company shall possess the following equipment as a minimum:  4 Senao High Powered Cordless Phones  5 Panasonic Notebook computers to drive Global Standard for Mobile, wireless network and record data.  8 Kenwood Radios (4 VHF  4 UHF)  1 KPG Programming Disk  14 GSM Handsets  14 GSM Sim Cards  2 Netgear Wireless access Points  2 Anritsu Hand-Held Spectrum Analyzers  2 Flexmaster Antennae  2 GSM Power Amplifiers This notice is for planning purposes only.  It is anticipated that a solicitation will be issued for an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity Firm-Fixed-Price, Commercial type contract issued under FAR Part 13.5. Firms are invited to submit any literature, brochures, and references necessary to support that they possess the required capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements.  There is a page limit of five (5) on data submitted.  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to SPAWARSYSCEN, Charleston, Jo Ann Lawless, at joann.lawless@navy.mil, Code 2.2.3JL. (Request that name of firm be stated in subject line of e-mail message). All Responses must include the following: (1) name and address of firm; (2) size of business: average annual revenue for past three years and number of employees; (3) ownership: Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), and/or Woman- Owned; (4) number of years in business; (5) two points of contact, including: name, title, phone, fax, and e-mail address; (6) DUNS Number (if available); (7) affiliate information:  parent corporation, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); (8) a list of customers covering the past 3 years; highlight relevant work including a summary of work performed, contract number, contract type, dollar value for each customer reference, and customer point of contact with phone number.

<DESC>A.	General Information.  <BR><BR>The Pacific Region (TRBO Region 12), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in Hawaii, Guam, Okinawa, Japan, and Korea annou nces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of IV Securement Devices.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination th at represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  <BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medica l Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/ Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with t he Prime Vendors for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a c ontract. For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of 2 years (24 months) from date of s election with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is December 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are consid ered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria. The selection of a single  vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and pro duct availability.  <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact<BR>Susan Hwang, TRBO Team Leader<BR>808-433-3686, susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.

At a minimum, the following items are required: <BR>"	IV Se curement Device that provides catheter stabilization that preserves the integrity of the access device and prevents catheter migration and loss of access in accordance with the Intravenous Nurses Society (INS) standard for Securement and stabilization of i ntravenous access devices.<BR>Provide certification of all brands of this product line that you manufacturer or distribute with the initial submittal.<BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the IV Securement D evices product line. Provided the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>3.	Vendors must have a separa te agreement with the regional prime vendor Cardinal Health for distribution in this Region and provide certification of this with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified). <BR >4.	Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS pri ces do not represent a discount off DAPA (Note that vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>5.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy pricing quotes and competitive product cross-reference in electronic MS Excel f ormat upon request.<BR>6.	Vendor must provide educational tools, product literature, and materials for IV Securement Devices as well as no cost samples for the evaluation. Describe your available company educational tools and material resources with the in itial submittal.<BR>7.	Vendor must provide customer service (telephonic and e-mail) for regional facilities. Identify company resources and capabilities for such support with the initial submittal.<BR>8.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative avai lable in the region. Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with the initial submittal.<BR>9.	Vendor will provide a device which meets the Intravenous Nurses Society (INS) standard for Securement and stabilization  of intravenous access devices. The standard is Infusion Nurses Standards of Practice #43: Catheter Stabilization Standards, which states catheter stabilizatio n shall be used to preserve the integrity of the access device and to prevent catheter migration and loss of access; catheters shall be stabilized using a method that does not interfere with assessment and monitoring of access site or impede vascular circu lation or delivery of prescribed therapy. This standard is met through evidenced based clinical research in which the device meets this standard. The vendor will provide documentation of the research, if requested. The rationale is to provide patient safe ty, avoid pain and suffering, avoid potential loss of venous access, avoid inflammatory processes at site, and to prevent IV access site infections.<BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process <BR><BR>The multi-disciplinary TPRB clinical team  will request samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 21 calendar days from the dat e of notification to complete the delivery. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 p.m. HST, on the 21st calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in  the standardization process.<BR><BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a likert scale, with a one to five rating. One (1) = strongly disagree, Two (2) = disagree, Three (3) = neutral, Four (4) = agree, and Five (5) = stron gly agree. All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted.<BR><BR>To determine acceptability, a TPRB Clinical Team comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The T PRB Clinical Team intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in a clinical setting, if needed. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a  non-clinical or clinical setting or both. <BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>1.	IV Securement device instructions for application to the skin are clear. (If any ski n preparation is required, the method contains the steps. For example, user is to wipe the skin with an identified proprietary solution or 70% isopropyl alcohol, and wipe skin to ensure that skin site is dry. The method for removing the coverings or tabs o n the adhesive portions of the device describe how to remove the coverings or tabs and the best method of placement of the adhesive side of the device on the skin) (to enhance staff efficiency).<BR>2.	IV Securement device instructions for removal of the de vice from the skin are clear. (The methods of peeling back or rolling edges of device from the skin are described. The use of any solution on the skin, for example 70% isopropyl alcohol or a proprietary adhesive remover, is stated) (to protect the patient) .<BR>3.	IV Securement device holds intravenous catheter securely in place. (Intravenous catheter does not slip back and forth or side to side after being secured with device) (to protect the patient)<BR>4.	IV Securement device does not irritate patient ski n. (No evidence of redness or blistering or puffiness of skin area.  No evidence of rash. No patient complaints of itching, burning or change in skin sensation at the site) (to protect the patient)<BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  <BR>After th e clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement. Vendors will be provided seven  calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email. Price quotes must be received by 5:00 p.m. HST on the seventh calendar day. Failur e to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s ), without discussions as noted above. However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary. <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than p rice. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a 2-year period with possible one-year o ption periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideratio n of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor. Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  <BR><BR>

<DESC>A.	 General Information<BR><BR>The Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment facilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Requ est for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Specimen Bags. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program <BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval  Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendo r program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for  the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For addit ional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with th ree 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is February 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significant ly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will be come more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anti cipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availabili ty. <BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Susan Hwang, TRBO Team Leader<BR>(808) 433-3686, susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, Clinical Analyst<BR>(808) 433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.

All e-mail co mmunications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quo tes. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC that their initial submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually a rrived at the Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>D.	 Eval uation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the decidin g officials for this initiative. <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.

Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the 21st calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.<BR><BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert type scale, with a one to five rating. One (1) = Strongly Disagree, Two (2) = Disagree, Three (3) = Neutral, Four (4) = Agree, and Five (5) = Strongly Agree. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. <BR><BR>To determine acceptability, the TPRB cl inical team, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines, will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The TPRB clinical team intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting; how ever, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluation in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Product i s comfortable on the skin. (Non-abrasive, soft to touch, does not redden skin or leave red marks) (to provide patient comfort).<BR>2.	Product has desired thickness and absorbency. (Does not lose shape when wet, does not unravel during bathing; after wringi ng out excess bathing solution or water, is still moist enough to bathe patient) (to enhance hygiene effectiveness).<BR>3.	Product packaging is easily opened and does not compromise the cleanliness of the product prior to use. (Packaging opens evenly, wash cloth does not pop out of the package unevenly, tearing the packaging and landing on the floor) (to enhance staff efficiency).<BR>4.	Product cleans appropriatel y. (Removes emesis, feces, blood and other bodily fluids without losing shape or leaving excess debris behind on the skin) (to enhance hygiene effectiveness).<BR><BR>Phase III: Pricing Analysis Process<BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is co mpleted and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirements. Vendors will be provid ed seven (7) calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email. Price quotes must be received by 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the 7th calendar day. Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive  discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/participation. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s) without discussion as noted above. However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussion and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. <BR>As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more  equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following element s will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines, (3) Potential Cost Avoidance (this is included as a reporting metric) and (4) Consideration of stockage keepin g units (SKUs) by each vendor. SKU review will assess the number of line items a vendor is able to supply to the MTFs versus the number of currently used line items.<BR>

<DESC>General Information<BR><BR>The Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment facilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Hot and Cold Packs. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the  clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program <BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Nava l Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vend or program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors fo r the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For addi tional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with t hree 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is February 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significan tly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will be come more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is ant icipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availabil ity. <BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Susan Hwang, TRBO Team Leader<BR>(808) 433-3686, susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, Clinical Analyst<BR>(808) 433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Paci fic Region is seeking product line items, in the category of Hot and Cold Packs, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $73,509. This forecast is based on  historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below. <BR><BR>At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will pro vide conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standar dization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil AND cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received by 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Ti me (HST) on the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating. All  e-mail communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best  price quotes. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC that their initial submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><B R>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are t he deciding officials for this initiative. <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in th is announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the Vendor's DAPA pricing (based  on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If industry participation is unsat isfactory, the TPRB will decide whether to proceed with or delay the project.<BR><BR>Phase I: Technical/Company Evaluation Process<BR><BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor.<BR>Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. Fai lure to respond to the technical/company criteria by the deadline will result in disqualification. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine the acceptability of each vend or. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Genera lly, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate: (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumable; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators h ave reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such product or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor i ntends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and, (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentati on of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Criteria have been established for this standard ization initiative:<BR><BR>1. Vendor must manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of Hot and Cold 	Packs (single use). A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for 	usage items in the product line. Usage items are defi ned in the Medical/Surgical Prime 	Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and 	at least one unit per order. Provide certification of all brands of this product line that you 	manufacturer or distribute with the ini tial submittal. At a minimum, the following items 	are required: Hot and cold packs in size approximately 6 inch by 6 inch, 7 inch by  	10 inch, and 4 inch by 11 inch.<BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for th e Hot and Cold Packs (single use) product line. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>3.	 Vendors must have a separate agreement with the regional prime vendor Cardinal Health for distribution in this Region and provide certification of this with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified). <BR>4.	Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA  price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount of DAPA (Note that vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>5.	Vendor must provide customer service (telephonic and e-mail) for regional facilities.

Product does not break apart or leak when activated. (Once activation action is taken, no chemicals or gel oozes our of the seams) (to protect the user and patient)<BR>2.	Product maintains therapeutic t emperature for a minimum of 30 minutes. (30 minutes is the minimum time to provide therapeutic effect. After 30 minutes either another compress can be applied or the product can be removed) (to be clinically efficacious)<BR>3.	Activation directions are cle ar and easily understood (Step by step directions clearly describing the actions to be taken by the clinician, whether a squeezing motion, a crushing motion, or  a shaking of the device to activate the chemicals) (to enhance staff efficiency).<BR>4.	The physical force required to activate the chemicals is easily applied. (The crushing action, squeezing action, or shaking motions can be performed by clinicians, inc luding those with small hands, with minimal effort) (to enhance staff efficiency).<BR><BR>Phase III: Pricing Analysis Process<BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group will be c ontacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirements.

In-service is required to meet the governments minimum need and is normal and customary.<BR><BR>All vendors will be required to provide product literature, training aid es and teaching materials to NH Guam, NH Yokosuka, NH Okinawa, 35th MDG Misawa, and the 121st CSH. Vendors who cannot provide product literature, training aides, and teaching materials to the above MTFs will be excluded from the standardization process. Th e application of this training option is required to meet the governments minimum need and is normal and customary.<BR><BR>Clinical evaluation process for TAMC. Each vendor will provide on-site, in-person, in-servicing for a period of one week. One vendor  per week. The TAMC TPRB Clinician will coordinate the scheduling and location of the in-service/product presentation. Day 1, vendor will provide in-service/product presentation. Day 2-5, clinical evaluation will be conducted. The vendor will be available for any questions, consultations, or guidance.<BR><BR>Clinical evaluation process for other participating MTFs. Each vendor will provide product literature, training aides, and teaching material prior to the clinical evaluation. The TPRB Clinicians will c oordinate the clinical evaluation. Day 1, the staff will review the product literature, training aides, and teaching material provided by each vendor. Day 2-5, clinical evaluations will be conducted. Vendors will be available by telephone for questions, co nsultations, and guidance.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>1.	Glove cuff fit, length, memory of cuff is adequate. (Glove cuff does not roll down wrist, does no t bunch up at wrist  adheres snugly to gown cuff)<BR>2.	Gloves are easily donned. (Glove easily fits over dry or damp hands)<BR>3.	Gloves are non-irritating to skin. (No reddened skin, no areas of discoloration, no evidence of raised blisters, rash, or co mplaints by wearer of pain or itching)<BR>4.	Gloves are flexible and glove material stretches across palm area, fingers and top of hand evenly. (Glove material does not restrict movement of hand, wrist and fingers)<BR>5.	Gloves provide tactile sensitivity.  (Wearer can discern tissue composition, position of suture ties, changes in tissue and body cavity temperature, can feel characteristics of tendons, muscles, v essels, lesions and skin and can feel the weight and balance of instruments)<BR>6.	Packaging allows for safe and sterile presentation to field. (Envelope edges of outer packaging separates evenly  no uneven edges of tearing into the inner <BR>	packaging)< BR>7.	Inner protective packaging remains open and flat and allows for easy access to gloves. (Inner packaging memory is imperceptible  the folded sections do not try to re-close and fold over gloves)<BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  <BR>After  the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement. Vendors will be provided 7 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email. Price quotes must be received by 5:00 p.m. HST on the 7th calendar day. Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices wi ll result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above. However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary. <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more impo rtant. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a 2-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analy sis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance (this is included as reporting metric only), (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due t o the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  <BR>

<DESC>General Information<BR><BR>The Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment facilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Sponge and Roll Dressings. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represe nts the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program <BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U. S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Pri me Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Ven dors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  F or additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection  with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is February 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered sig nificantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will be come more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor  is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product av ailability. <BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Susan Hwang, TRBO Team Leader<BR>(808) 433-3686, susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, Clinical Analyst<BR>(808) 433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>T he Pacific Region is seeking product line items, in the category of Sponge and Roll Dressings, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $51,713. This foreca st is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below. <BR><BR>At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, ve ndors will provide conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating i n this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil AND cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil  Submissions must be received by 4:00 p.m. Hawa ii Standard Time (HST) on the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from part icipating. All e-mail communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of e lectronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC that their initial submission, quotes, and literature or other requested in formation has actually arrived at the Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submi ssion.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Regi on. They are the deciding officials for this initiative. <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines r equested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the Vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If industry particip ation is unsatisfactory, the TPRB will decide whether to proceed with or delay the project.<BR><BR>Phase I: Technical/Company Evaluation Process<BR><BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor.<BR>Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria sta ted below. Failure to respond to the technical/company criteria by the deadline will result in disqualification. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine the acceptabilit y of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company cr iteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate: (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumable; (2) based on the vendors responses, th e evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such product or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that f ail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5 ) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and, (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct. Any m isrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Criteria have been established for  this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Vendor must manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of Sponge and Roll Dressings. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items ar e defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. Provide certification of all brands of this product line that you manufacturer or distribute with the initial submittal. At a minimum, the following items are required: Sponges (2x2, 4x4, fluff, cover, sterile and non sterile), Abdominal pads, Gauze rolls, and stretch gauze rolls.<BR><BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DA PA number for Sponge and Roll Dressings product line. Provided the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified). <BR><BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the regional prime vendor Cardinal Health for distribution in this Region and provide certification of this with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the r egional PV will be disqualified).<BR><BR>4.	Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price  as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount of DAPA. (Note that vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified).<BR><BR>5.	Vendor must provide customer service (telephonic and e-mail) for regional facilit ies. Identify company resources and capabilities for such support with the initial submittal<BR><BR>Phase II: Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process<BR><BR>The multi-disciplinary TPRB clinical team will request samples (no charge) from the product line to  be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 21 calendar days   from the date of notification to complete the delivery. Samples must  be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the 21st calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.<BR>< BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert type scale, with a one to five rating. One (1) = Strongly Disagree, Two (2) = Disagree, Three (3) = Neutral, Four (4) = Agree, and Five (5) = Strongly Agree. All clinical/perfo rmance criteria are weighted equally. <BR><BR>To determine acceptability, the TPRB clinical team, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines, will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The TPRB clinical team intend s that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluation in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Cr iteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Product packaging can be easily opened (without touching the product, the product is easily dropped on sterile field, seems peel open evenly, packaging does not shred, fray or tear  unevenly on either side of package) (to prevent contamination) <BR>2.	While opening packaging, product does not pop out of packaging falling onto table or floor surface (Product remains in packaging until presented to sterile field or to clinician) (to pr event contamination)<BR>3.	Product does not lint (no material flakes, falls or drops from product when product is opened or placed on the wound) (for patient sa fety)<BR>4.	Product remains in place as applied by clinician (product does not move or slide off the wound area, product does not crinkle, wrinkle or stick to the clinicians gloves) (for patient safety)<BR>5.	Product is absorbent (texture and weave absorbs  and retains blood pus, or serous body fluids) (for patient safety)<BR>6.	Product is non abrasive when placed against skin (product does not chafe or cause any type of irritation to the skin redness, bumps) (for patient safety)<BR><BR><BR>Phase III: Pricin g Analysis Process<BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed  volume of 80% of the total Regional requirements. Vendors will be provided seven (7) calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email. Price quotes must be received by 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the 7th calendar day . Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/participation. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or v endor(s) without discussion as noted above. However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussion and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily tha n price. <BR>As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) year period with possib le one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines, (3) Potential Cost Avoidance (this is  included as a reporting metric) and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor. SKU review will assess the number of line items a vendor is able to supply to the MTFs versus the number of currently used line items.<BR>

This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."
United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires the purchase of Process Model Software.  The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Process Model, Inc.of 32 West Center Street Provo Utah, 84601. Interested parties may e-mail stephen.colton@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-6967, Attn: Stephen Colton, not later than Monday, 03 March, 2008, 12:00 p.m. EST.
Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:
 The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)

USSOCOM currently uses and requires Process Model software to model and simulate business process, in order to identify business process inefficiencies and implement improvements. To purchase a similar software from any source would cost approximately $33,300, exceeding the Independent Government Estimate. This assumes an average replacement cost of $2,775.00 multiplied by twelve. Twelve is the minimum number of licenses that would need to be purchased to provide all required users with the new software. This figure also does not include the additional cost, in terms of time and money that would be required to test the new software and train SOCOM personel on its proper use. In summary, if a new, similar type of software were to be purchased, there would be a substantial duplication of cost, to the Government, that is not expected to be recovered through full and open competition.

<DESC>It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract under statutory authority of the test program for commercial items Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.501(a)1(ii),  only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This agency intends to award to Innovation Associates 627 Field St Johnson City,  NY 13790.

1.  The 6th Medical Support Squadron  Squadron requires the addition of a third PharmAssist drug dispensing system model AS/G-100 and training to be used in the MacDill AFB Satellite Pharmacy.  

2.   The award of a contract for the PharmAssist system must  be awarded to Innovation Associates because they are the sole manufacturer and distributor of this product.  The use of any other dispensing systems would pose communication, connectivity and security issues as the equipment has to be compatible with the existing equipment.  Due to proprietary rights and technical knowledge it would prevent other companies from installing the equipment and performing system software upgrades unless system replacement takes place.  Current replacement of the system is not cost effective for the government.  

3.  Market research was conducted for the PharmAssist  system. Innovation is the only contractor found able to provide the product/service as we require. If no response to this notice is received by 3:00pm EST on Tuesday March  4, 2008, the award for the PharmAssist AS/G-100 will be made to Innovation Associates.

<SUBJECT>D -- E-AUTHENTICATION SOLUTIONS
<DESC>SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION IS SEEKING A COMPANY WHO SPECIALIZES IN E-AUTHENTICATION SOLUTIONS

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking to provide enhanced Internet services to the public.  These services require high levels of assurance for our authentication protocols.  We must know and trust the identity of individuals presenting themselves to us across the Internet.  The main e-authentication challenge for SSA is that our dealings with individuals are infrequent and sometimes involve only one or two contacts during a lifetime (e.g., a request for a replacement Social Security Number card or application for retirement benefits.)  

The e-authentication solutions employed at SSA must comply with OMB Memorandum M-04-04 and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-63.  While our e-authentication goal is to protect the data housed in our records, we note that there must be a balance between data protection and usability.    

SSA is seeking vendors qualified to develop and implement OMB level 3 assurance e-authentication solutions for customers who wish to use SSA online services.  We are looking for a company with previous experience helping clients implement similar public-facing Internet e-authentication solutions.  The solutions previously implemented should closely align with a level 3 assurance as per the Office of Management and Budget?s (OMB) Memorandum M-04-04. We are also requesting that interested vendors provide information on cost models (for example, will there be a flat fee, annual fee, or volume-based charges).

If you believe that you have the capability to successfully develop and implement such a solution, you are asked to provide a capability statement and GSA schedule number (if applicable) to SSA.  Please submit your response in writing directly to Kim Baldwin Sparks at kim.baldwin.sparks@ssa.gov  no later than Wednesday, March 12, 2008.   NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<SUBJECT>D -- IDENTITY PROOFING
<DESC>SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION IS SEEKING A COMPANY WHO SPECIALIZES IN IDENTITY PROOFING

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking to expand our e-authentication protocols to provide for more complex Internet transactions so we can provide enhanced Internet services.  These services will require strong level 3 identity proofing techniques in order to adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-63 and OMB Memorandum M-04-04.

SSA is seeking vendors qualified to provide identity proofing services to verify the identity of Internet users who wish to enroll for SSA online services as per National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-63 using:

a.	A Government issued ID number with confirmation via records check.   
b.	A financial account number with confirmation via records check.  
c.	Current address with confirmation via records check. 

We may also be interested in using additional types of data that will uniquely identify users of our Internet applications.  The data may be current or historical but should be something that an individual can easily remember.  We welcome your ideas regarding such additional data elements.

The solution must be able to verify all data elements in real time.  In addition, interested vendors must show that quality controls are used to collect and verify the data.  The data transmission must be compliant with OMB and NIST guidelines. We are requesting that interested vendors provide information on cost models (for example, will there be a flat fee, annual fee, or volume-based charges).

SSA is seeking vendors who can provide these services.  If you are interested in this contract and believe that you have the capability to successfully perform the above tasks, you are asked to provide a capability statement and GSA schedule number (if applicable) to SSA.  Please submit your response in writing directly to Kim Baldwin Sparks at kim.baldwin.sparks@ssa.gov no later than Wednesday, March 12, 2008.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<SUBJECT>--Modification of One of the Two Existing IOTV Contracts
<DESC>The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Acquisition Center (USRDECOMAC) awarded two contracts, W91CRB-07-C-0084 to Specialty Defense (SD) and W91CRB-07-C-0085 to Point Blank Body Armor (PBBA), on the basis of 10 USC 2301(c) (2) an d FAR 6.302.2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency on 21 May 2007, for the procurement and initial fielding requirement of 230,000 Improved Outer Tactical Vests (IOTVs).  The total fielding requirement of the IOTV is 966,000.  While the initial 230,000 IOTVs we re in production, a full and open competitive procurement plan was prepared to fulfill the remaining 736,000 IOTVs to achieve the Armys Acquisition Objective.  A Request for Proposal (RFP), W91CRB-07-R-0079, was issued on 30 November 2007 for the remainin g IOTVs.  Due to numerous requests from vendors, the closing date of the RFP was extended until 15 April 2008.  As a result of the extensions, and the need for continual production, one of the contracts will be extended for six months.  The modification of  one of the current contracts will be awarded based upon the statutory authority permitting Other than Full and Open Competition is 10 USC 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(b) (ii), Unique supplies or services available from only one or a limited number of sources or from only one or a limited number of suppliers with unique capabilities.  SD and PBBA are currently the only two sources that have US Army tested and approved ballistic material packages, and the manufacturing capabilities to meet the current IOTV production and performance requirements.  Both SD and PBBA are capable of producing the monthly requirement of 25,000.  The modification of one of the existing contracts for a total of 150,000 IOTVs, at the rate of 25,000 IOTVs produced per mo nth for six months, will be awarded based on the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal.  The USARDECOMAC point of contact for this action is Mitzi Wall, telephone 410-278-0868, email:  mitzi.wall@us.army.mil.  Any questions as a result of this post ing shall be submitted in writing and emailed to the above listed address.

SAIC, in conjunction with Surveylab, is developing the ike 504, a secure chip Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module SAASM vers ion of the current ike 305 hand-held Geographic Information System GIS Capture device. The current ike 305 continues to be the only hand-held GIS related device that incorporates a Global Positioning Satellite receiver; digital camera; inclinometer; compas s; and a laser designator capable of lasing a target up to 1000 meters and getting the associated geo-location information all in one hand-held unit.  The ike 504 will expand upon this uniqueness by incorporating the SAASM chip into the ike 305.  The SAASM  chip, developed by Rockwell-Collins, and controlled by the NAVSTAR GPS-Joint Program Office JPO, uses the state-of-the art security architecture mandated by the DoD for all new GPS systems.  The SAASM-based GPS receiver is treated with a tamper-resistant coating to ensure safeguarding of classified military GPS data. The SAASM based receiver is the only receiver that is unclassified when keyed with Selective Availability.  Additionally, the unclassified SAASM receiver maintains all secure information inter nally and provides only unclassified outputs, including the permitted point solution information.  <BR>

REGION:  Multiple Zones
CONTRACTING OFFICER: Anthony Kemp
PHONE NUMBER:  817 978-2684
PROJECT: New Construction & Repair and Alterations
PROJECT TYPE:   Various
CLIENT AGENCY: Department of Homeland Security
SIZE: BUDGET: Varied
GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:  
Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation?s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to plan and design new or expanded Federal facilities as well as repair and alterations of facilities to provide outstanding quality, value and operational design.  Projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for Federal employees.
In this context, The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design Services for Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements and the facility will be designed in metric units. All new facility designs will be LEED certified, and shall be designed to meet the Silver standard as defined in the U.S. Green Buildings Council in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System to the extent the budget allows. 

Projects will be varied, including renovations, expansions or new facilities.  Expedited design and delivery approaches will be promoted, including prototype design, prefabricated and modular construction, and use of pre-designed components.  Thought should be given to the most appropriate and cost effective construction materials; and design, construction, and delivery methods suitable to the project.  Various project delivery methods, including traditional design and construction, and bridging-design-build, will be used. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This is a solicitation for A/E services for a period of one year with four additional one-year option periods.  Firms are not required to be geographically located in the State where the project is located, and are not required to have an active design production office within the State to be considered for award; however, successful A/E firms will be required to be licensed/registered within the State prior to the award of task order for a specific project and shall conform to all laws, rules, and requirements of that state governing the profession of architecture or engineering.  Multiple awards are expected to be made for each of the primary services areas (zones) as follows:  
Zone 1: California, Arizona, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Alaska
Zone 2:  New Mexico and Texas
Zone 3:  North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine.
Secondary service areas will include the contiguous United States.
The selected A/E firm shall primarily provide design services, including feasibility studies, bridging documents (35% construction documents), and full design and construction services, and research and reports related to the design of Federal facilities.  The final designs may be operationally complex and technologically sophisticated site and civil-intensive projects with a balance between aesthetic, functional, and security issues, including state-of-the-art data and telecommunications systems, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and other requirements.  Awardees under this requirement will not be eligible for award (individually or as a team member) on any design build projects resulting from work under any contract awarded under this requirement.

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services may require: problem analysis, feasibility studies, energy analysis, life cycle costing, building information modeling, surveys, site and existing conditions surveys, design, planning, interior design, traffic and civil engineering, and estimating services for new construction, and repair and alteration projects. At times the contract may also require selected firms to provide civil engineering, boundary and topographical surveying, sustainable design, environmental studies, quality control testing, asbestos sampling/hazard assessment/ abatement design, historic structure reports, building evaluation reports, scope development, construction management, and other architectural, engineering and technical services. New construction may be up to approximately 50% site work and require extensive civil, traffic, environmental, signage and environmental graphics, as well as primarily architectural, landscape architectural, interior design, mechanical, electrical, structural services, and cost estimating, but may also necessitate geotechnical, fire safety, elevator, acoustical, lighting, historic preservation, construction management/inspection, surveyor and other disciplines with specialized experience. The selected A/E firms may be required to provide design services that include alternative energy, prefabrication or modular construction, and/or expedited design and delivery solutions.  The selected A/E firms may be required to participate in peer review processes. A/E?s may be required to develop prototypical designs, and the Government reserves the right to go back to the architects to modify and site adapt for any and all locations throughout the life of the contract.  All facilities will be designed in metric units. There will be no limit on the amount paid on individual delivery orders and no limit on project size; however the total cumulative delivery order amount shall not exceed $12 million in any one contract period, and the minimum guaranteed contract amount is $1000 for the base year and each of the option years, if exercised. Firm-fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts will result from this solicitation, including profit, overhead and hourly rates for anticipated disciplines and for use in negotiating firm-fixed price delivery orders. A supplemental architect-engineer lookup table for pricing delivery orders design services for projects with an estimate construction cost of less than $2 million will be included in the contract.  All design services will be in accordance with GSA requirements, design guides, and standards.  The design of new and renovation projects at ports of entry is an example of the design programs GSA anticipates ordering under this contract.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.   Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:   solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.   The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.   Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

Evaluation Factors
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

Evaluation
Award will be made to the offeror whose demonstrated Technical Capability offers the Best Value to the Government, Price, Past Performance and other factors considered. Technical Capability is significantly more important than the combined importance of Price and Past Performance.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  However, this requirement is unrestricted and all responsible offerors may submit a quotation. 

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a HIGH- ENERGY PULSED FIBER LASER to be used in the Polymers Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD. 

***BACKGROUND
The mission of the group includes development of methods for noninvasive imaging of biological systems, and characterization methods for biopreservation glasses.  This high-energy solid state, pulsed laser is to be used as an integral part of a time-resolved dynamics apparatus, which is to be used for characterizing fluorescent tags for biological staining, and dynamics of glasses for biopreservation.


***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item(s):  

Line Item 0001 - The Contractor shall furnish one (1) each, HIGH ENERGY PULSED FIBER LASER

The item to be purchased is a solid state, high-energy pulsed fiber laser, which will be part of an experimental setup for measuring fast dynamics of proteins in biopreservation glasses, and for performing time-resolved optical measurements of quantum dots.

The technical requirements listed below are motivated by the need to develop a simple, low-maintenance broadband CARS microspectroscopy system, such as could be used in a medical or biological laboratory.  The pulse characteristics (wavelength, power, and bandwidth) are required to generate a desirable broadband continuum in commercially available optical fibers.

*** The system shall meet or exceed the following technical specifications:

1.  Maintenance-free, turn-key operation is required
2.  Computer-interface for initiation and optimization of mode lock is required
3.  Laser should produce ultrashort light pulses at a variable repetition rate in the range (0.5 to 1.0) MHz, with the following pulse characteristics at 1 MHz: pulse width must be compressible to less than or equal to 700 femtoseconds using only passive compression, and pulse energy greater than or equal to 1.5 microJoule
4.  Output light must be of wavelength somewhere in the range (1.0 to 1.1) micrometer
5.  RMS power fluctuations should be less than 3 percent
      6.  Light output must be linearly polarized

*** Installation/Training/Warranty

1.  The contractor shall schedule and facilitate installation/set-up and one (1) training session for up to three (3) technicians at NIST.

The training shall provide a thorough demonstration of all equipment functions, maintenance, data administration, and basic troubleshooting.  The training may be completed at NIST immediately after installation/set-up and demonstration of performance specifications (as described below), but shall be completed no later than 30 days after delivery. 

2.  Quotation must include unlimited telephone/e-mail support, during the warranty period, for questions regarding operation, and at least a one-year warranty.  This warranty must cover non-consumable parts and travel/labor on-site should this become necessary within the warranty period.  ***

*** Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

1.  Visual-Physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications.
2.  Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications.  The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready, as determined by the contractor, and may be witnessed by the contractor.  System will not be accepted by NIST until all of the requirements are met.  At a minimum, specific testing to confirm pulse width, power, and stability will occur prior to acceptance.***

**Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the contractor?s commercial schedule. ***

***The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.

Additionally the system should lockout the ability to hold a classified conference until all requirements have been met. Digital signs shall be mounted inside and outside the room informing personnel of the classification of the meeting as well as other pertinent information. This system should switch seamlessly between classified and unclassified modes of operation. The lectern should hold all equipment and be stained to match the existing conference table and have a logo to match the logo on the existing lectern. The table should have multiple connection boxes that pop up allowing connections to the system of the controller, sympodium, and stand alone laptops. All cables should be routed in a manner as to not be seen. All components of the system should be of a quality that it will support future technological upgrades for years to come. It needs to be simple enough for anyone to enter the room and set up a conference. The system should operate over IP as well as ISDN.

Version 14 Feb 2008 1445L

The contractor shall provide all labor, personnel, materials, parts, transportation, and any other items necessary to fabricate parts, remove and install a static display aircraft A-10 from Pope AFB to Seymour Johnson AFB, NC.  This process will be conducted in two phases.  During the first phase, the contractor will disassemble, package, transport and reassemble an A-10 aircraft from Pope AFB, NC to Seymour Johnson AFB, NC.  The contractor will transport the aircraft to a designated hangar and reassemble the aircraft in a towable condition.  The contractor shall also fabricate and install the upper portion of the support column (TS 16?x16?) with a base plate and top mount similar to that shown on Sheet S-1 and also used for the F15E, F100, and F86 static displays currently on display at Seymour Johnson AFB.  The contractor shall be responsible for designing the column-to-aircraft connection details on top of the upper column. This upper column shall be fabricated to be compatible with the lower section of the column as far as bolt alignments, etc (also shown on Sheet S-1). The proposed pitch for the A-10 is 15 degrees nose high and the proposed bank is zero degrees (wings level). The aircraft will then be turned over to members of the 4 MXG for the restoration process.  The aircraft is currently designated to be added to the aircraft park display located within Heritage Park.  The aircraft is planned, tentatively, to be placed between the F-100 and F-86 aircraft.  The 4 FW will have the ground portion of the stand (pylon), completed prior to the return of the contractor.  
During the second phase the contractor will return to Seymour Johnson AFB to mount the A-10 (with integral upper column) on an existing lower support column (TS 24?x24?) with the top plate and bolt pattern as shown on Sheet S-1.  The contractor will remove the outer wing panels to permit towing of the aircraft from the flight line to the display site and will reassemble the wings at the display site.  During installation of the aircraft mounting plate, the contractor will keep visual modifications to the aircraft to a minimum and replace any removed skin panels with like aircraft grade metal and fasteners.  The contractor will lift the aircraft onto the designated stand (pylon) and securely attach the two pylons at the mounting plates.

PROJECT: New Construction & Repair and Alterations
PROJECT TYPE:   Various
CLIENT AGENCY: Department of Homeland Security
SIZE: BUDGET: Varied
GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:  
Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation?s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to plan and design new or expanded Federal facilities as well as repair and alterations of facilities to provide outstanding quality, value and operational design.  Projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for Federal employees.
In this context, The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design Services for Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements and the facility will be designed in metric units. All new facility designs will be LEED certified, and shall be designed to meet the Silver standard as defined in the U.S. Green Buildings Council in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System to the extent the budget allows. 

Projects will be varied, including renovations, expansions or new facilities.  Expedited design and delivery approaches will be promoted, including prototype design, prefabricated and modular construction, and use of pre-designed components.  Thought should be given to the most appropriate and cost effective construction materials; and design, construction, and delivery methods suitable to the project.  Various project delivery methods, including traditional design and construction, and bridging-design-build, will be used. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This is a solicitation for A/E services for a period of one year with four additional one-year option periods.  Firms are not required to be geographically located in the State where the project is located, and are not required to have an active design production office within the State to be considered for award; however, successful A/E firms will be required to be licensed/registered within the State prior to the award of task order for a specific project and shall conform to all laws, rules, and requirements of that state governing the profession of architecture or engineering.

Secondary service areas will include the contiguous United States.
The selected A/E firm shall primarily provide design services, including feasibility studies, bridging documents (35% construction documents), and full design and construction services, and research and reports related to the design of Federal facilities.  The final designs may be operationally complex and technologically sophisticated site and civil-intensive projects with a balance between aesthetic, functional, and security issues, including state-of-the-art data and telecommunications systems, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and other requirements.  Awardees under this requirement will not be eligible for award (individually or as a team member) on any design build projects resulting from work under any contract awarded under this requirement.

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services may require: problem analysis, feasibility studies, energy analysis, life cycle costing, building information modeling, surveys, site and existing conditions surveys, design, planning, interior design, traffic and civil engineering, and estimating services for new construction, and repair and alteration projects. At times the contract may also require selected firms to provide civil engineering, boundary and topographical surveying, sustainable design, environmental studies, quality control testing, asbestos sampling/hazard assessment/ abatement design, historic structure reports, building evaluation reports, scope development, construction management, and other architectural, engineering and technical services. New construction may be up to approximately 50% site work and require extensive civil, traffic, environmental, signage and environmental graphics, as well as primarily architectural, landscape architectural, interior design, mechanical, electrical, structural services, and cost estimating, but may also necessitate geotechnical, fire safety, elevator, acoustical, lighting, historic preservation, construction management/inspection, surveyor and other disciplines with specialized experience. The selected A/E firms may be required to provide design services that include alternative energy, prefabrication or modular construction, and/or expedited design and delivery solutions.
