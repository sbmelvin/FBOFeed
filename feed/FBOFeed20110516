<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory is announcing to business and academia its intent to solicit proposals under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). This announcement does not request any proposals at this time. Solicitations (or calls) for proposals will be accomplished via amendments to this BAA.
<p>The over-arching strategy of the BAA involves the use of this 5-year open-ended BAA to quickly and efficiently execute research and development to deliver practical solutions to urgent problems. These efforts are anticipated to entail rapidly (in less than one year) integrating existing technology into field testable, functional prototypes of solutions to military problems in three (3) major Technical Areas of:</p>
<p>1) Tactical ground support equipment, including innovative solutions that may encompass advanced sensors, laser systems, communications including satellite communications, power generation and storage, information and computing technology, lightweight munitions, and advanced materials.<br />2) Unmanned vehicles and sensors, including innovative solutions that may encompass autonomous robotic ground and aerial systems, advanced airborne and ground-based sensors, guidance and navigation, modular munitions, propulsion systems, long range data communications, advanced command and control for air, space and cyber systems, and cooperative systems of systems.<br />3) Human-machine interfaces and data visualization, including innovative solutions that may encompass human factors engineering, advanced ergonomic technology, auditory and visual display technology, haptics, adaptive systems, data fusion, machine control including speech and gesture, and cognitive modeling.</p>
<p>This strategy will provide AFRL an acquisition tool with the flexibility to solicit proposals and make awards to perform rapid prototyping of technical solutions to meet present and compelling Air Force needs as ever-changing urgent operational issues are identified.</p>
<p>The BAA will remain "open" for 5 years; however, proposals will only be solicited and accepted during calls. Each call will identify solicitation topics and contain a common cut-off date for proposal submission. Proposal receipt after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).</p>
<p>Calls for proposals (made by amendments to this BAA) will occur periodically throughout the life of this over-arching BAA. Each call will: (1) identify specific problems or issues facing warfighters for which an innovative solution is needed urgently; (2) identify any changes to the standard evaluation criteria or proposal preparation instructions, and; (3) contain common cutoff dates for proposal submissions.<br /><br />It is anticipated that solicitations issued under this BAA will be unrestricted. Small businesses are encouraged to propose on all of the solicitations. The NAICS code, unless otherwise stated in the BAA amendments, shall be 541712 (i.e., Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences except Biotechnology), and the size standard is 500 employees. Proposals submitted shall be in accordance with this BAA and its appropriate amendment(s).</p>
<p>Interested offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that call for proposals, permit extensions to the proposal submission dates, or otherwise change the requirements of this BAA or its subsequent amendments.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1 - this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Further, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541512, Computer Systems Integrator Services with a size standard of $18 Million.  The FAA expects to release the associated Screening Information Request (SIR) - Request for Proposal (RFP) in the spring of 2012.  This is a new acquisition.
All responses (one per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 20 typewritten pages.  No type font less than 11 point may be used.    Background:The communications network that serves aviation weather information users today is a complex system of point-to-point communication paths that relies on a diverse collection of hardware, software, and protocols.  In the current environment, the addition of data sources or users requires costly purpose-built connections and service adaptors.  As the FAA implements the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), the increasing use of data products with high spatial and temporal resolutions and the addition of new users to the network will impose significant demands on the capacity of the FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) Operations Internet Protocol (IP) network. 
Acquisition:NextGen Network Enabled Weather (NNEW) must be a mission-critical content distribution network that will enable the dissemination of weather information to users throughout the National Airspace System (NAS).  NNEW must consist of a combination of hardware and software, which may include origin and distribution servers.  The FAA maintains a preference for COTS components.  NNEW must register and store weather data produced by the FAA, other Federal agencies, and private vendors.  It must identify and designate certain data as authoritative from among conflicting sources.  It must receive query and subscription messages from users, identify and locate the data requested, filter the data and perform format conversions, and provide users with IP references to access the information.  NNEW must also enable the FAA to manage and maintain the performance of the network. Lastly, NNEW must enable the FAA to manage and enforce access to weather data by users in and outside of the NAS.
NNEW must operate on the FTI Operations IP network. It must interface with users outside of the NAS through the NAS Enterprise Security Gateway.  NNEW must manage data from new and legacy systems that use various data formats.  NNEW must also be compatible with the FAA's System Wide Information Management (SWIM) system. The FAA has identified the following critical success factors for NNEW: 	Optimize (i.e., minimize) the use of bandwidth within the NAS	Optimize (i.e., minimize) the flow of data into and out of the NAS	Optimize (i.e., minimize) the physical footprint of the system	Meet the latency requirements of weather information users in the NAS	Be scalable to meet the needs of an increasing number of data sources and users	Enable weather data format standardization	Meet the FAA's requirements for a mission-critical service	Minimize costs to the FAA and to users
Purpose:This market survey is to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition and to determine whether adequate competition exists.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.
The FAA requires copies of certification letters for interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  
Vendor Capabilities:Due to the scope, size, and complexity of the NNEW system, the FAA anticipates that the successful response to the RFP may represent a teaming arrangement of multiple contractors. The FAA encourages participation in the FAA Mentor-Protg program.  The FAA has not yet decided on a procurement strategy. 
The FAA expects the successful vendor to possess knowledge, capabilities, and experience in the following areas:
	Program management	Information technology, including hardware deployment, software development, and COTS customization	Service-oriented architecture	Implementation and operation of a content distribution network	Efficient bandwidth utilization	Use of geospatial data filtering, a registry/repository, and messaging, specifically to include a publish once and subscribe many times capability	Knowledge of FAA weather sensors, weather formats, and air traffic management systems	Knowledge of Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards and geospatial data reformatting and compression
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:
CAPABILITY STATEMENT:
All responders must provide a Capability Statement that addresses the following (in order):
a.	Type of services provided by your firm (including teammates or subcontractors) that demonstrate ability to perform the services described above.b.	Services provided under previous contracts to enable the dissemination of weather or similar information that are similar in size, scope and complexity to this effort.  c.	Provide detailed information and past performance information for at least three (3) previous contracts including program title, customer name, project dates, project value, customer point of contact, and description of work performed.

<DESC>SynopsisMarket Survey Sources Sought to Provide aPratt & Whitney Canada (PWC) PW305A Engine Maintenance/Overhaul Program
General Information:
	The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Aviation System Standards (AVN) is conducting a Market Survey looking for sources/vendors that can provide an Engine Maintenance/Overhaul program for fourteen (14) FAA PWC PW305A aircraft engines.  Twelve (12) engines are installed on six (6) FAA Learjet 60 aircraft and two (2) engines are maintained in spare status.  The FAA PW305A engines are currently enrolled in a program and are under contract through March 31, 2012.
This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) of any kind.
The FAA is looking to continue coverage of their PW305A engines in a Maintenance/Overhaul program that covers the cost of maintenance, labor, and parts on a cost per engine operating hour basis.  Other support coverage is desired as part of the program and would cover maintenance events, parts, or engine services that are not covered as a cost per engine operating hour basis.  Other support coverage would be requested as needed and the cost would be considered as an Over & Above (O&A) basis using a time and materials format.
The current program that provides coverage for the fourteen (14) FAA PWC PW305A aircraft engines may have cash reserves at the end of the existing contract and balances available to the FAA would be utilized for continued coverage.
A "draft" Statement of Work (SOW) which describes the desired coverage, program requirements, and current program cash reserve utilization is included with this Market Survey. 
All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey/Request for Information.  Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey/Request for Information submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense. Costs provided are for market survey/informational purposes only and shall not be considered as an offer to do business.
Response to this Market Survey:
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable. The FAA will require this information in development of the bidders list if and when this requirement proceeds to the acquisition phase.  
Any information provided under this market survey is for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  No evaluation of vendors will occur and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA.
All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead.  No type font less than 12-point may be used.  Responses must be received no later than 3:30 P.M, Central Time on June 10, 2011.  Market survey responses received after the time and date specified will be determined to be late and may not be considered.  
The FAA intends to review all response submittals to establish the acquisition strategy.  Responses to this market survey will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB) or Small Business, or open it up for full and open competition.  The information identified from this market survey may result in a restricted Screening Process when the RFP is issued.  This survey is being conducted in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1.  This survey will support market research obtained from multiple sources and will be utilized for planning purposes only. The NAICS code for this effort is 336412 "Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts Manufacturing" with a size standard of 1000 employees.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:        Type of services provided by your firm,         Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide          detailed information and past performance),         Number of years in business,        Experience with PW305A engine maintenance programs.
2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide services 
3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses. 
The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following email address: john.hawk@faa.gov.  Please submit in a portable document format (pdf); however, Microsoft Word is acceptable.  If you cannot respond electronically, please send two copies by the indicated deadline to:

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 and the business size standard in $7.0M.  <br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.
<p>Period of Performance:  Performance shall be for twelve months from date of award with one twelve month option period.</p>
<p>NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data represent an important source of complete, population-based information regarding survival after cancer.  NCI and SEER recently developed an online prototype targeted to clinicians, the Cancer Survival Query System (CSQS), a "survival calculator" which displays detailed and co-morbidity-adjusted SEER survival data for colorectal and prostate cancer patients. Adapting these existing NCI tools to display survival data for breast cancer and its subtypes could be very useful in the breast care setting, but it remains uncertain how to structure these tools so they best meet the needs of practicing breast surgeons and oncologists.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide specifications needed for NCI to implement an online "survival calculator" displaying detailed, co-morbidity adjusted SEER survival data for breast cancer patients, targeted towards physicians' needs and preferences.  The contractor shall demonstrate the calculator and assess its utility among clinicians.</p>
<p>CPIC has participated in several successful multidisciplinary efforts to reconsider the most effective dissemination of SEER data to particular audiences. The study team CPIC, formerly the Northern California Cancer Center, has full access to the human, laboratory, informatics, and intellectual resources necessary to successfully complete this project; these resources are described below.  Briefly, these resources include the Greater San Francisco Bay Area's population-based NCI SEER cancer registry and its associated staff with strong expertise in the use and dissemination of SEER data, especially in clinical settings; appropriate, state-of-the-art computer hardware and software and associated technical support from the CPIC Information Services/Information Technology (IS/IT) staff.  Other important resources include access to the Stanford Cancer Center core facilities, including the Biostatistics Core, and other Stanford University resources, including a full complement of scientific and medical literature from the Stanford University libraries and collections.  The physical location of the CPIC offices, in the heart of the San Francisco Bay Area, enables easy access to and from other local research organizations, including Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley, University of California, San Francisco, Kaiser Division of Research, and the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Research Institute.  Thus, all aspects of this environment and its resources ideally position this team to lead the proposed project.</p>
<p>One key to their unique capability is the fact that the California cancer registries are the only population-based registries to have included HER2 status for breast cancer patients starting in cases diagnosed in 2005 and after (and in a limited capacity prior to 2005).  The remaining registries are including HER-2 starting in cases diagnosed in 2010 and after.  HER-2 is a critical prognostic variable to include in the survival models, and having that variable going back a number of years is a unique and necessary asset.  In addition CPIC has assembled a team that has expertise in the coding of breast cancer in the SEER registries and expertise in the analysis and interpretation of comorbidity data, with a long history of research in both areas.  Finally, CPIC is unique in its collaboration with the ATHENA Breast Care Network (http://www.athenacarenetwork.org/ ) which has been identified as a unique network across all 5 University of California medical centers, whose aim is to unite California women, physicians, and researchers in an effort to personalize breast cancer prevention, screening, and treatment.  CPIC's collaboration with  the Athena Network will allow for: (1) a unique ability to test the CSQS is a cutting edge breast cancer health care program, and (2) explore the possibilities of incorporating the CSQS as a dashboard tool as part of their electronic medical record system.  No other sources with this unique combination of attributes which are needed to insure the objectives of this study are known to NCI.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on May 31, 2011.  No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax). An original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Ward, Contract Specialist, at  wardmr@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference solicitation number NCI-110068-MW on all correspondence.</p>

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b)(1) and FAR 13.501 (a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 3345160<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>and the size standard is 500 employees.
<p>The National Eye Institute requires a FluorChem M Imaging System, Cat# 92-15312-00. The scientific grade-imaging system has the capability to detect low-abundant proteins, which requires a highly sensitive imaging system. FluorChem M uses an 8.3 megapixel CCD detector capable of imaging 65,536 levels of grayscale which provides high-resolution images. In addition the CCD is thermoelectrically cooled to -25 C absolute and regulated. This maximizes signal to noise as well as dark current reduction and provides superior low light sensitivity. This enables FluorChem M to provide the level of detection needed for both chemiluminescent and flouorescent protein samples in an array of different formats.</p>
<p>The FluorChem M scientific grade-imaging system offers great flexibility in using the system for a multitude of imaging applications, and allows other lab personnel to take advantage of the system for their research<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>projects as well. Cell Biosciences has also agreed to offer installation, ongoing training services and support at no charge for the entire scientific staff located at the National Eye Institute. Not having to transition to another vendor's system and software will be less interruptive and more time-efficient for laboratory personnel, also avoiding the associated learning curve.<br /><br />No solicitation package will be issued.

<p>&bull;Provide real-time order status, accurate delivery schedules, and delivery confirmation notices to the ordering activity and installation contractors, of any item ordered (not merely those noted in the aforementioned catalog);</p>
<p>&bull;Facilitate the customs process for in-country receipt of overseas shipments;</p>
<p>&bull;Identify and develop technology to improve technical security capability, minimize security vulnerabilities, and reduce costs;</p>
<p>&bull;Maintain the technical specification documents for TSS;</p>
<p>&bull;Test and evaluate identified commercial-off-the-shelf equipment or systems for approval or disapproval;</p>
<p>&bull;Identify and incorporate innovative, superior technology in DS-approved equipment and systems while staying abreast of new developments and technologies;</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>REQUIREMENT:
<p>The United States Government currently occupies approximately 10,147 Rentable Square Feet yielding a minimum of 8,824 to a maximum of 9,265 ANSI/BOMA Usable Square Feet of contiguous office space and 16 parking spaces, under an existing lease in Boardman, Ohio. The Government is considering if alternative space is economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocation, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure. This is an inquiry for available space and is not to be construed as an invitation to bid.</p>
<p><br />DELINEATED AREA:</p>
<p>The proposed space must be located within the City Limits of Boardman, Ohio.</p>
<p>REQUIRED:<br />Public transportation is required within 2 city blocks or 600 feet, which ever is less.

The offered space must meet, or be capable of being altered to meet the Government requirements for Security, Fire and Life Safety and Handicapped Accessibility. All space shall be contiguous.</p>
<p>Offered space must be contiguous. Second floor or above is required. Space configuration shall be conducive to an efficient layout.</p>
<p>Space shall not be located within a base flood plain or wetland unless the Government has determined it to be the only practicable alternative. Space should not be located near establishments where alcoholic beverages are sold or served, or where there are tenants related to drug treatment or detention facilities. Space will not be considered where apartment space or other living quarters are located within the building. The Government requires a fully serviced lease. The Government shall have access to the space 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>

<CONTACT>Linda A. Spessato, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-205-5423, Fax 202-708-4982, Email linda.spessato@gsa.gov
<DESC>The General Services announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. Project Summary: GSA intends to award a firm-fixed price Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) contract, based on a Guarantee Maximum Price (GMP), for all design assist phase services and construction phase work necessary (as an option) to construct and equip Phase I of the Department of State (DOS) Museum of American Diplomacy and Visitor Center in Washington, DC. Phase I of the Museum of American Diplomacy and Visitor Center will consist of the Pavilion, which will be an addition to and connect to the DOS building, and shall function as the public entrance and reception area of the Museum of American Diplomacy and Visitor Center.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Phase II, the remainder of the Museum of American Diplomacy and Visitor Center, shall be constructed within the existing DOS building at a later date under a separate contract. The Pavilion shall house exhibits, which shall be fabricated and installed under the scope of this solicitation, and provide for the security screening of the public, as well as DOS employees and guests. The Pavilion shall consist of approximately 20,422 GSF on two levels; the upper level will consist of 12,378 GSF; and the lower level will consist of 8,044 GSF.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The estimated construction cost, including all construction work and exhibit fabrication and installation, ranges between $18,000,000 to $24,000,000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All work will be performed in accordance with GSA authorized and approved standards. The facility will be located entirely on Federal Property at the site of the Harry S Truman Department of State headquarters building, near the corner of Virginia Avenue and 21<sup>st</sup> Street, NW, Washington, DC. The project will be built in the foreground of the existing entrance to the George C. Marshall Wing of the Old War building. The pavilion is designed to complement the proportions and massing of the existing historical fa&ccedil;ade in an unobtrusive manner, while shall house exhibits, interactive technology and compelling artifacts to foster understanding and appreciation for the importance of diplomacy and to increase American's awareness of diplomacy and the work of the Department of State. The project will include non-office spaces, such as exhibit and assembly spaces, and support areas to facilitate the public use, such as restrooms, a coat check room, shops and light dining.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Security, safety and transparency are major concerns and are reflected in the facility design and circulation patterns. The project is being designed to meet LEED certification. <br />
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><br />A Construction Manager as Constructor provides design assist phase services and construction phase work. GSA intends to award a contract for Design Phase Services with an option for the Construction Phase Work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The CMc is required to complete the Design Phase Services for the firm-fixed-price presented in the procurement process. At any time during or after Design Phase Services, the Contracting Officer may request that CMc provide a firm-fixed-price proposal for the Construction Phase Work. The Contracting Officer shall have the right to convert the contract to a firm-fixed-price contract at the offered price or as otherwise negotiated by the parties to this contract, so long as such price is less than or equal to the GMP. If the parties to this contract negotiate and establish a firm-fixed-price for the Construction Phase Work Option, then the Contracting Officer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to exercise the firm-fixed-price Construction Phase Work Option within 60 calendar days of the establishment of that Option price.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" />Design Phase Services include, and are not limited to, preliminary evaluation of the Architect of Record design development documents; review and evaluation of the Architect of Record construction document submissions for constructability; review and evaluation of all Architect of Record cost estimates; reconciliation of all cost estimates; participation in all construction document team meetings; value engineering suggestions; identification of any problems or errors in the design and design documents; consultation during design document production; preliminary project schedule development; identification of long-lead items, independent pricing of design document phase and construction document phase submittals; preliminary cost estimates; development of subcontractor and supplier interest; and, establishment of firm-fixed pricing. The CMc shall possess a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration. The CMc must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project. Most importantly, the CMc shall have complete responsibility for the construction of the facility, should the Option for Construction Phase Work be exercised.<br /><br />Construction Phase Work includes, and is not limited to, construction; project scope management; selection and procurement of all necessary subcontractors; administration of the construction contract (how much work is performed with the CMc's own forces or under subcontract); administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts; coordination of regular construction meetings; critical path method (CPM) scheduling and schedule control; maintaining construction records including daily logs and monthly reports; monitoring construction costs; progress reporting; conducting and coordinating inspections and testing to ensure proper functioning of the building; participation of an Alternative Dispute Resolution partnering consultant; coordination of commissioning and turnover to designated facility management staff and tenants; performing closeout procedures; and, all other required services necessary for a complete and sustainable facility.<br /><br />The CMc is a member of the project team during the design and construction phases, along with GSA as the public owner; GSA's selected architecture and engineering firm and Architect of Record; GSA's building commissioning firm; GSA's security consultant, and other consultants. The CMc shall be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of, and not limited to, architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines as needed to perform the services described herein.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">Procurement strategy:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A source selection/greatest value method will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement. The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked. GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being approximately equal to price.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is an advisory two step procurement process, per FAR 15.201.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The selection process will have two stages. Stage I, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), shall result in the establishment of a list of offerors identified as Viable Competitors, who will be invited to participate in the next stage of the procurement, Stage II. Stage II, Request for Proposals (RFP), shall result in the selection of the CMc contractor whose offer provides the Government with the best value. In Stage I, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that are critical to this procurement and that will serve as the basis for the determination of the viable competitors. Interested offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each offeror in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the RFP or, based on the information submitted in the RFQ response, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. Notwithstanding this advice, an offeror that is unlikely to be a viable competitor may participate in Stage II of the procurement. Offerors that did not submit a timely RFQ response in Stage I will not be allowed to participate in Stage II of the procurement. In Stage II, the Government will issue the RFP, which will include the Final Concept Design drawings, including an exhibit package, to the viable competitors and the other offerors from Stage I that elect to participate in Stage II. The RFP will serve as the basis for the firm-fixed GMP price offers from the offerors in Stage II. The firm-fixed GMP price offers will be due by the date established in the RFP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Based on the Stage I and Stage II submissions, the Government shall select the offer that reflects the best value to the Government. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Stage I and Stage II offers without discussions. The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about June 14, 2011, on the Internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.<br /><br />Opportunities for Other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate as prime contractors, or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses, or as subcontractors. Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and FAR Subpart 19.702, an offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a subcontracting plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable. In this procurement, GSA intends to promote subcontractors' use of registered apprenticeship programs.</p>

<DESC>The work includes the construction of an approximately 720 foot earth channel between the end of an existing concrete box culvert and Kennedy Avenue, including demolition of miscellaneous features, clearing and grubbing, constructing new steel channel walls and anchorages adjacent to the existing box culvert, earthwork for the channel, deep soil mixing, and stone channel base material. An existing 90-inch diameter sanitary effluent outfall main is to be relocated, while remaining active; including the use of pile supported temporary and permanent piping. The work also includes construction vibration monitoring and control, site drainage, pavements, fencing, pile tests and incidental related work.<BR>The project work occurs in three general phases. The objective of Phase 1, Exploratory Excavation and Preparation, is to locate and document the existing outfall main so that a new relocated main can be accurately constructed. Work in this phase includes: clearing and grubbing along with degrading portions of the site; cutting off flows of surface water into the site by plugging the existing box culvert near one end of the work area and building an earthen berm near the other end; determining precise location and elevations of the existing outfall main; and installing a cofferdam and bracing system along with protective measures adjacent to the outfall main. In Phase 2, Sanitary Outfall Main Relocation, the objective is to construct a new main along an alignment below the new channel while keeping effluent flows continuous. Work in this phase includes: providing a temporary bypass main including taps, line stopping and diverting flows to the bypass main; demolishing portions of the existing main and constructing a permanent main following the new profile below the channel; deep soil mixing and backfilling of areas adjacent to the permanent main; diverting flows to the permanent main; and removal of the bypass main. Phase 3, Slope Stabilization and Finishing, involves performing the remaining work activities for a complete and functional project. Work in this phase includes: additional deep soil mixing for stabilization of the new channel; providing the wing walls and anchorage system at the end of the existing box culvert; constructing the new earthen channel with stone channel base material; removing portions of the cofferdam; constructing local drainage features, pavements, and fencing; removing the temporary earth berm and box culvert plug; and miscellaneous construction and closeout activities. The estimated period of performance is 730 calendar days after receipt of the Notice to Proceed. Magnitude of construction is between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00. PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS: Award will be made to the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) proposal. Proposals will be evaluated on technical, past performance and price. THIS IS AN UNRESTRICTED ACQUISITION. The solicitation will be issued on or about 14 February 2011 with proposals due on or about 31 March 2011.

<DESC>Description - Upgrade B 31 Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning
The work includes, but is not limited to providing all labor, materials, transportation, equipment and supervision for this project. The work also includes general construction, alterations, and mechanical, electrical, fire protection, plumbing, and structural work. Upgrade B 31 Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning equipment, distribution, and controls to current VA standards for in-patient healthcare environment. Include third party commissioning services in this project to ensure quality control, maintenance processes, training, and proper controls.
Existing HVAC equipment in Building 31 has exceeded useful life and has an FCA condition grade of 'D'. Chilling capacity is undersized for the building and is not available year round despite the fact that this is the main inpatient hospital for the facility. Condition results in poor indoor air quality during the shoulder months (temperature and humidity). Air exchange rates and pressurization are questionable due to leaking duct work. 1972 vintage systems and equipment do not meet current energy standards and are inefficient resulting in inflated operating and Maintenance and Repair costs in the largest building on campus.
The NACIS code for this procurement is 238220.

<DESC>1.  Sources Sought.  This is a sources sought announcement seeking capability responses from Small Businesses only and responses to market research questions from all interested firms of any size. This notice serves the purpose of conducting market research.  The Mission and Installation Contracting Command Mission Contracting Office - Fort Eustis will consider setting this requirement aside for small businesses or for socioeconomic categories such as Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs), Woman-Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) firms if market research supports doing so. The Mission and Installation Contracting Command Mission Contracting Office - Fort Eustis intends to procure the services described herein.  The US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Capability Manager - Army Training Information Systems (TCM-ATIS) anticipates a requirement for technical support to transition and sustain the Army Training Information Architecture (ATIA) and Army Training Information Architecture-Migrated (ATIA-M) applications, as well as the Army Training Information System (ATIS).  The contractor shall support system continuity of service with architecture analysis, development and maintenance consistent with the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DODAF); applications design, development, and maintenance; information assurance documentation development and maintenance; functional help desk support; and system-engineering services.  The anticipated period of performance is a base period of twelve (12) months and two (2) one-year option periods.  Work shall primarily be performed at Army Training Support Center (ATSC), Fort Eustis, VA.<br>  <br>2.  Background.  The ATIA program consists of two major parts: the architecture (ATIA); and the integrated set of applications and services (ATIA-M).  ATIA provides development, storage, and delivery of Army doctrine, training, and educational  materials to Soldiers and units anytime, anywhere.  ATIA supports all levels of Army training and includes training products for all three pillars of Army training - Unit, Institutional, and Self-development.  The ATIA-M consists of nine primary applications:<br><br>a.  Automated Systems Approach to Training (ASAT).  ASAT is being replaced by the Training Development Capability (TDC), projected to be completed before December 2011.  ASAT allows training developers to develop collective and individual tasks and drills, Mission Training Plans (MTP), Drill Books, Soldier's Training Publications (STPs), lesson plans, Course Administrative Data (CAD) and Program of Instruction (POI).  <br><br>b.  ATIA Common Core Services (CCS) are the functions responsible for providing common levels of service throughout the ATIA-M.  Specific functionality provided includes content discovery/search, access controls to content, user authentication, user authorization, and content registration.<br><br>c.  ATIA - Reimer Digital Library (RDL) is the Army's official repository for training and doctrine publications, in addition to the Army Knowledge Online (AKO) website.  It is comprised of two distinct collections: official departmental publications; and commandant-approved products.<br><br>d.  Lifelong Learning Centers (LLCs) are the physical instantiation of the Army Training and Doctrine Command's (TRADOC's) lifelong learning concept.  As the Army continues to transform to a leaner, more deployable, and more lethal force with state-of-the-art equipment for sustaining well-trained Soldiers, Army training is moving forward with more adaptive learning technologies.  LLCs comprise a suite of technologies that enable online posting of schoolhouse curriculum materials, courseware downloads, and distributed collaboration among users.<br><br>e.  My Training Home Tab (MT2) is a web page operating on the AKO website.  The MT2 provides Soldiers with access to their training records, Army training applications, essential training, "what's hot" and other training related functionality.  Current functionality is based on links to applications; the MT2 is intended to evolve and become functionality focused to provide Soldiers and civilians with an integrated course catalog for enrollment uses and Soldier access to their Individual Training Record.  The MT2 is currently accessed more than 1,000,000 times monthly.<br><br>f.  Reception Battalion Automated Support System (RECBASS) is the system that accesses over 100K new recruits into the Army each year.  RECBASS provides a single point of entry/updates for the Soldier's record while the recruit is being accessed into the Army.  Functionality provided by RECBASS includes the collection of personnel, pay, medical, training, and clothing records, and electronically transmitting that data to other electronic systems, reports, and required forms.  RECBASS receives the recruiting record from Army Recruiting Information Support System (ARISS) and feeds several Army standard systems, for example: Electronic Military Personnel Office (E-MILPO), Defense Joint Military System (DJMS) (pay), Army Training Requirements and Resources System (ATRRS) and Resident Individual Training Management System (RITMS).  RECBASS is projected to be discontinued in late FY 12.<br><br>g.  Resident Individual Training Management System (RITMS or RITM) is an information and report management system that furnishes Army schools, training centers, Non- Commissioned Officer (NCO) academies, and civilian training centers with a tool for creating and managing individual training records and events.  Categories of course data included in the system are scheduling, testing, academic, graduation, personnel and attrition.  RITMS is mandatory for institutional student management throughout TRADOC.  <br><br>h.  System Training Plan (STRAP) Writing Tool (SWT).  The SWT is a web-based collaborative writing tool that is used for document creation, authoring, and staffing.  SWT provides the ability to maintain control over a document by granting permissions to those that are required to view and modify. SWT provides templates, instructions, examples, references, and supplemental references to ease and expedite document creation.  SWT provides the ability for users to collaborate and perform modifications on the same document concurrently.  This allows for rapid document development as multiple authors can populate the same document and always have access to the latest version of the document.  SWT allows for a document to be staffed for review at the Peer, Army, and Approval levels.  Through the use of gate keepers, a document that has been staffed to an organization for review can additionally be staffed internally.  This ensures that a wide audience can provide feedback on a document.<br><br>i.  Training Development Capability (TDC).  TDC is a web-based application, designed to comply with Army policy.  TDC allows training developers to develop, manage and maintain Army training products, to include: collective and individual tasks; drills; MTP; Drill Books; STPs; lesson plans; CAD; and POI.  Additional functionality has been developed to provide automated product staffing and approval.  When completed, TDC will replace ASAT as a component of the ATIS.  Projected TDC deployment will be accomplished by DEC 2011.  Additional functionality projected to be developed includes support for education, job and task analysis, test item analysis, and criterion-reference performance testing.<br><br>3.  Technical/Functional Requirements.  The major task areas to support this effort will include:<br><br>a.  Functional Analysis, Design, Development, and Deployment - design, develop and deploy applications to comply with functionality as specified within Government approved Use Case/Function Point (UC/FP) documentation.  Analysis, design, development and deployment shall be accomplished using Agile methodology and test driven development techniques.<br><br>b.  Provide for the continuity of user familiarization by providing training of all applications functionality through the use of job aids, on-line help, training, training support packages and lessons to be executed through online, onsite and self paced downloadable tools.<br><br>Tasks to be performed will include:<br><br>a.  Ongoing analysis of all new and/or existing training and/or education requirements that may be applicable to any TCM-ATIS managed application.  Requirements are expressed in Use Case (UC) and Function Point (FP) documents written and maintained by the contractor.  UC documents include performance metrics, business rules, roles/responsibilities, and responsiveness requirements.  FP documents are more detailed and describe actions and grouped activities at the product execution level and identify individual requirements which are the statements of activity necessary to achieve a requirement approved by the government.  UC and FP documents are required to initialize the Agile process methodology.<br><br>b.  Complete analysis and documentation required to automate content authentication processes in compliance with Army publishing requirements defined within AR 25-30.  Work shall begin with contractor conducted requirements analysis, and continue with development of UC/FP documents for government approval.<br><br>c.  Provide functional analysis, UC/FP, and Functional Test Matrix (FTM) for Government approval.<br><br>d.  Provide strategic analysis of Continuity of Operation Planning (COOP) and support for classified processing consistent with current and known future Army regulation and Department of Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) requirements.  <br><br>e.  Update and maintain the Army Training Information Architecture (ATIA) architecture framework System Architecture (SA), and Operational Architecture (OA) views.  The ATIA architectures shall be maintained consistent with the Department of Defense Architecture Framework, to reflect known and emerging functionality.  <br><br>f.  Initialize and sustain the system design (and continued through maintenance) working within developmental staff that use the Agile methodology.  Agile will be continued for those existing systems in use of Agile and Agile shall be implemented in any new developmental work.  Agile software development is a group of software development methodologies based on iterative and incremental development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams.  <br><br>g.  Provide the government full demonstration of both sprint and release proposed deliverables as part of the Agile process in coordination with the software/system development team.

Help calls are to be responded to telephonically, by email, or through online collaboration. <br><br>j.  Develop training products (Online Help Tools [Electronic Performance Support System], POI, TSP, and Job Aides) for the ongoing training of users by staff and faculty.   Provide/deliver training via Video Teleconference (VTC), Defense Connect Online (DCO) and on site classroom instruction and support, ranging from 30 in a classroom to 100 VTC or 200 on DCO.<br><br>k.

<p>Because of recent approval to expand a collaborative stent project with MIT, it is necessary to purchase the more advanced microscope to work in concert (and for interchangeability of accessories and attachments) with the already existing Keyence VHX-500 and VHX-600 that are used to inspect, measure, record, and analyze many different medical devices for material defects, fractures and out-of-tolerance dimensions. In particular the VHX-1000E will be used for pre and post test inspections and characterizations of the many stent designs and sizes that are life tested under this initiative.</p>

<CONTACT>Claudia G. Melgar, Phone 3014923487, Email Claudia.Melgar@nrc.gov
<DESC><strong>Title</strong>
<p>Crack Growth Rate Measurements of Welded Nickel Alloys Pressurized Water Reactor Environments</p>
<p><strong>Sources Sought Synopsis</strong></p>
<p>This is a sources sought synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposal. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) is conducting a market survey and analysis to determine the range of available contractors that exists and assess their capabilities to assist the NRC with project work described below. The NRC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to provide potential sources the opportunity to submit information regarding their capabilities to perform work for the NRC free of Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCOI). For information on NRC OCOI regulations, visit NRC Acquisition Regulation Subpart 2009.5, entitled "Organizational Conflicts of Interest" (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/contracting/48cfr-ch20.html). All interested parties, including all categories of small businesses (small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone small businesses) are invited to submit a response to the market research questions below and submit the capability information as described below. Submission of additional materials such as glossy brochures or videos is discouraged. Responses are due no later than June 15, 2011. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the requested information. Telephone inquiries or responses are not acceptable. Facsimile (301-492-3437) or email (Claudia.Melgar@nrc.gov) responses are acceptable or responses may be mailed to: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Attn: Claudia G. Melgar, Contract Specialist, Division of Contracts, MS TWB-01-B10M, 11555 Rockville Pike Rockville, MD 20852.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The NRC is responsible for the licensing and regulatory oversight of civilian nuclear power reactors in the United States. The Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) furthers the regulatory mission of the NRC by providing technical advice, technical tools and information for identifying and resolving safety issues, making regulatory decisions, and promulgating regulations and guidance. RES conducts independent experiments and analyses, develops technical bases for supporting realistic safety decisions by the agency, and prepares the agency for the future by evaluating safety issues involving current and new designs and technologies. RES develops its program with consideration of Commission direction and input from the program offices and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Primary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC) is a known degradation mechanism affecting nickel-base alloy primary pressure boundary components in pressurized water reactors (PWRs). PWSCC preferentially occurs in components that operate at high temperatures and pressures. Fabrication and welding processes and especially weld repairs leave residual stresses that promote cracking in susceptible materials. Materials with improved resistance to PWSCC such as alloy 690 and associated weld metals, alloy 52 and 152 have been used in both replacement components and in mitigation methods such as weld onlays and overlays. While the service history of alloy 690 and its weld metals has been favorable, significant industry led and international efforts are underway to characterize factors that influence the PWSCC susceptibility of these alloys.</p>
<p>The objective of this program is to obtain PWSCC growth rate data to evaluate fabrication processes on Alloy 690 and its weld metals including the effects of welding parameters and weld filler metal compositions. These objectives will be accomplished by producing welds with dimensions and welding parameters representative of those expected in reactor components using Alloys 152 and 52 filler metals. Compact tension (CT) specimens machined from the welded material will be produced to allow testing of the weld metal, weld heat affected zones, and the dilution zones of dissimilar metal welds (e.g. Alloy 690 to austenitic stainless steels or low alloy steels). Testing of the CT specimens will be conducted under PWR primary water chemistry at typical operating temperatures and pressures conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Sought</strong></p>
<p>The NRC is seeking to identify commercial organizations capable of providing technical assistance in producing representative welds and in performing experimental measurements of PWSCC growth rates of Alloy 690 and its weld metals in simulated PWR environments. The facility shall have existing capability to weld nickel base alloys, austenitic stainless steels, and low alloy pressure vessel steels. Specific capabilities requirements for welding and machine shop capability are listed below.</p>
<p>1. Knowledge and experience welding the alloys of interest using gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) and shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) methods.<br />2. Knowledge and experience developing weld procedure specifications (WPS) and documentation of procedure qualification records (PQR) in accordance with the requirements in the ASME boiler and pressure vessel (B&amp;PV) code.<br />3. Knowledge and experience with nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of alloys and welds using methods such as ultrasonic testing (UT), penetrant testing (PT), radiographic testing (RT) and application of the corresponding acceptance criteria for these NDE methods specified in the ASME boiler and pressure vessel (B&amp;PV) code. <br />4. Machine shop capable of fabricating CT test specimens and required test fixtures of the crack growth rate systems described below. Test fixtures and CT specimen requirements are included in ASTM E399 and E1681. <br />5. Ability and experience to handle, decontaminate and machining materials from operating or decommissioned commercial nuclear power reactors that have slight contamination/activation. This may include samples with measured radiation levels of 50 mR/hour (contact).<br />The facility shall also have a minimum of 3 test systems previously used and validated for conducting corrosion fatigue and stress corrosion cracking crack growth rate measurements on 1T-CT and sub-size CT specimens. Specific capabilities for crack growth rate testing system capabilities are provided below.</p>
<p>1. Continuous loading of at least 40 MPa&radic;m [36 ksi&radic;in] for periods as long as 1 year.<br />2. Cyclic loading waveforms including sinusoidal, trapezoidal, and sawtooth with frequency capability of 0.0005 to 5 Hz.<br />3. In-situ crack length measurement with a minimum of 5 micron resolution.<br />4. Continuous corrosion potential measurement of the CT specimens<br />5. Flowing autoclave test systems at temperatures up to 350&deg;C [662&deg;F] with a temperature stability of 5&deg;C [9&deg;F] and dampening to control pressure fluctuations. <br />6. Water chemistry control for maintaining boron and lithium concentrations at typical PWR concentrations (e.g. 1000 ppm B as H3BO3 and 2.0 ppm Li as LiOH).<br />7. Primary water pH measurement.<br />8. Ability to control dissolved hydrogen concentration in the range of 0 to 100 cc/kg.<br />9. Ability to selectively add other dissolved gasses such as oxygen, nitrogen and argon.<br />10. Automated data acquisition system to measure crack length in situ with accuracy to 10-9 mm/sec growth, water temperature, mixing loop water conductivity, autoclave water outlet conductivity, specimen load, and specimen stress intensity.<br />11. Ability and experience testing specimens that have been produced from components removed from either operating or decommissioned reactors and which may have radioactive contamination/activation.</p>
<p>The facility should have an existing mechanical property testing and metallurgical characterization facility. Staff must have knowledge and experience with metallurgical characterization of the alloys, weld metals and weld heat affected zones of interest. Specific capabilities of the metallurgical characterization facility are included below</p>
<p>1. Rockwell and microhardness testing systems compatible with alloy and welds of interest.<br />2. Yield and tensile strength testing of alloys per the requirements of ASTM E8. <br />3. Sectioning, mounting, polishing and etching capability for nickel base alloys and stainless steels.<br />4. Metallurgical microscope(s) with digital imaging.<br />5.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 8520-00-NIB-0130<br />Name: Refill, Instant Hand Sanitizer, Gel, Green-Certified, TFX 1.2L<br />Description: .2 Liter green-certified instant hand sanitizer gel refill, made with 100 percent naturally renewable ethanol. Meets EcoLogo CD-170. UOI is box. Box = 4 refills.</p>
<p>NSN: 8520-00-NIB-0131<br />Name: Refill, Instant Hand Sanitizer, Foam, Green-Certified, TFX 1200ml<br />Description: 1200 ml green-certified instant hand sanitizer foam refill, made with 100 percent naturally renewable ethanol. Meets EcoLogo CD-170. UOI is box. Box = 2 refills.</p>
<p>NSN: 8520-00-NIB-0137<br />Name: Instant Hand Sanitizer, with Dermaglycerin, Foam, Pump Bottle 535 ml<br />Description: 535 ml pump bottle of instant hand sanitizer foam that has been specially formulated with dermaglycerin to moisturize and improve dry, damaged, skin that is the result of frequent handwashing. UOI is box. Box = 4 bottles.</p>
<p>NSN: 8520-00-NIB-0138<br />Name: Instant Hand Sanitizer, Foam, with Dermaglycerin, FMX Systems 1200 ml<br />Description: 1200 ml instant hand sanitizer foam that has been specially formulated with dermaglycerin to moisturize and improve dry, damaged, skin that is the result of frequent handwashing. UOI is box. Box = 12.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the Department of Veterans Affairs, National Acquisition Center, Hines, IL.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>None Reported</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Venier Software &amp; Technology LLC, 13979 SW Millikan Way, Beaverton, OR 970052886 for described below.
<p><br />1- Item Code LQ-MS-DX Middle School LabQuest Deluxe Includes:<br />24 LABQ - Vernier LabQuest Interface<br />24 MD-BTD - Motion Detector<br />24 PH-BTA - PH Sensor<br />24 VP-BTA - Voltage Probe<br />24 TMP-BTA - Stainless Steel Temp Probe<br />24 LS-BTA - Light Sensor<br />24 DFS-BTA - Dual-Range Force Sensor<br />24 GPS-BTA - Gas Pressure Sensor<br />24 HGH-BTA - Hand-Grip Heart Rate Monitor<br />24 CON-BTA - Conductivity Probe<br />24 MG-BTA - Magnetic Field Sensor</p>
<p>2- Item Code MSV - Middle School with Vernier</p>
<p>3- Item Code LP - Logger Pro 3</p>
<p>4 - 1 Day Workshop</p>
<p>The Vernier LabQuest is a hand-held stand-alone scientific laboratory interface with over 50 available sensors/probes including a motion detector, pH sensor, voltage probe, stainless steel temperature probe, light sensor, dual-range force sensor, gas pressure sensor, hand-grip heart rate sensor, conductivity probe, and magnetic field sensor. NIST has purchased LabQuests for use with the 44 teachers in the NIST Summer Institute for Middle School Science Teachers during the summers of 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 and needs to continue purchase from the same source so that the new teachers coming into the program in Summer 2011 will have the same equipment. If NIST were to procure the sensors and probes from another vendor, NIST would have to extend the timeframe for the Summer Institute due to a significant learning curve for Summer Institute support staff and for the Middle School teachers.</p>
<p><br />The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed- price purchase order. This notice of intent is not a request for quotations; however, companies that believe they can fulfill the requirement may provide a written response to this notice and provide clear and unambiguous evidence to substantiate that capability. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competition.</p>

<DESC>Direct Productive Person Hours (DPPH) of 152,464, on the existing JTAGS contract (DASG60-94-C-0073) for Engineering Services, will be decreased to 115,001 DPPH equating to $7,500,000. This ceiling will be correspondingly reallocated to new travel ($2,475,000) and materials/Other Direct Costs (ODCs) ($5,025,000) CLIN(s). <br>This will allow for the completion of development and fielding of the Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I), Initial Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Geosynchronous (GEO) Capability (IGC).  FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) services are deemed to be available only from one source for the continued provision of highly specialized services. The primary aim of this effort is to complete the production and fielding of the JTAGS IGC. Award of this modification to any other source other than Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation would result in unacceptable program delays and in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government, which is not expected to be recovered through competition.  A full and open competitive follow-on Pre-Planned Product Improvement contract is in its planning phase, and will be solicited as soon as necessary approvals are obtained.  <br>This modification will provide support through 30 September 2013.  All responsible sources may submit a response, timely submitted, which shall be considered.  Interested parties may identify their interest, in writing, to the Government point of contact (POC), Ms. Christy L. Tarantini.  Response to this notice must be received no later than, 1 June 2011, 12:00 p.m. CST. The point of contact for this notice is Ms. Christy L.

<DESC>TITLE: Quantitative Microflora Analysis Assays on Nonhuman Primate (Macaque) Specimens in Port-a-Cul Transport Tubes<br /><br />BACKGROUND : The Laboratory Branch supports DHAP's goals in HIV prevention as they pertain to clinical studies, viral transmission, diagnosis and incidence, intervention research with microbicides, vaccines, and chemoprophylaxis as well as investigates other human and zoonotic retroviruses. The lab also requires quantitation, isolation, evaluation of microflora in animal modeling system (using non-human primates) that affect HIV infection and prevention including drug resistance. Changes in vaginal bacterial microflora are major susceptibility factors for HIV infection. It is therefore critical to evaluate whether microbicides or other mucosal HIV prevention efforts induce changes in vaginal or rectal microflora in macaques. Such changes in macaques could constitute serious safety concerns for any proposed interventions.<br /><br />PURPOSE: The Government requires Contractor services to perform analysis assay services of the Quantitative Vaginal and Rectal Microflora Testing on Macaque specimens that will be provided in Port-a-cul transport tubes and provide quantitative data for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CCID, NCHHSTP, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Laboratory Branch.<br />

<DESC><p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA) on behalf of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Beckman Coulter, Inc., 4300 N Harbor Blvd., M/S E-21-C, Fullerton, CA 92834 to provide service coverage for six (6) analytical ultracentrifuges.</p>
<p>Beckman Coulter, Inc. is the only vendor that can provide service maintenance and replacement parts and repairs to the Beckman Coulter analytical ultracentrifuges (AUC) instruments.

Beckman Coulter, Inc. holds exclusive/proprietary rights to software and parts for the Beckman-Coulter Analytical Ultracentrifuges, thus supporting the determination to make a sole source award to Beckman Coulter, Inc.</p>
<p>The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Building 13, 3rd Floor, Wing A, 13 South Drive, Bethesda, MD 20814.</p>
<p>The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

(For further information, the Contracting Officer is a federal government employee who is specifically authorized and appointed in writing under specified agency procedures and granted the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate contracts and make related determinations and findings.)

<p>ADVERTISING OF AWARD<br />The contractor shall not refer to contract awards in commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the product or service provided is endorsed or preferred by the Federal Government or is considered by the Government to be superior to other products or services.</p>
<p>MAJOR BREACH OF SAFETY OR SECURITY<br />(a) Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. Safety is essential to TSA and compliance with safety standards and practices is a material part of this contract. A major breach of safety may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this agreement, including termination for default. A major breach of safety must be related directly to the work on the agreement. A major breach of safety is an act or omission of the Contractor that consists of an accident, incident, or exposure resulting in a fatality, serious injury, or mission failure; or in damage to equipment or property equal to or greater than $1 million; or in any "willful" or "repeat" violation cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or by a state agency operating under an OSHA approved plan.</p>
<p>(b) Security is the condition of safeguarding against espionage, sabotage, crime (including computer crime), or attack. A major breach of security may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this agreement, including termination for default. A major breach of security may occur on or off Government installations, but must be related directly to the work on the agreement. A major breach of security is an act or omission by the Contractor that results in compromise of classified information or sensitive security information or sensitive but unclassified information, including contractor proprietary information, illegal technology transfer, workplace violence resulting in criminal conviction, sabotage, compromise or denial of information technology services, equipment or property damage from vandalism greater than $250,000, or theft greater than $250,000.</p>
<p>NOTE: Breach of Security for the purposes of this definition should not be confused with breach of security in screening operations.<br /><br />(c) In the event of a major breach of safety or security, the Contractor shall report the breach to the Contracting Officer. If directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall conduct its own investigation and report the results to the Government. The Contractor shall cooperate with the Government investigation, if conducted</p>
<p>INTERRELATIONSHIP OF ASSOCIATE CONTRACTORS</p>
<p>The TSA may enter into contractual agreements with other Contractors (i.e., "Associate Contractors") in order to fulfill requirements separate from the work to be performed under this contract, yet having a relationship to performance under this contract. It is expected that contractors working under TSA contracts will have to work together under certain conditions in order to achieve a common solution for TSA. The Contractor may be required to coordinate with other such Contractor(s) through the cognizant Contracting Officer (CO) and/or designated representative in providing suitable, non-conflicting technical and/or management interface and in avoidance of duplication of effort. Information on deliverables provided under separate contracts may, at the discretion of the TSA and/or other Government agencies, be provided to such other Contractor(s) for the purpose of such work.</p>
<p>Where the Contractor and an associate Contractor fail to agree upon action to be taken in connection with their respective responsibilities, each Contractor shall promptly bring the matters to the attention of the cognizant CO and furnish the Contractor's recommendations for a solution. The Contractor shall not be relieved of its obligations to make timely deliveries or be entitled to any other adjustment because of failure of the Contractor and its associate to promptly refer matters to the CO or because of failure to implement CO directions.</p>
<p>Where the Contractor and Associate Contractors are required to collaborate to deliver a service; the Government will designate, in writing and prior to the definition of the task, to both Contractors, a "lead Contractor" for the project. In these cases the Associate Contractors shall also be contractually required to coordinate and collaborate with the Contractor. TSA will facilitate the mutual execution of Non-Disclosure Agreements.</p>
<p>Compliance with this Special Contract Requirement is included in the contract price and shall not be a basis for equitable adjustment.</p>
<p>NON-PERSONAL SERVICES</p>
<p>"Personal services" are those in which contractor personnel would appear to be, in effect, Government employees via the direct supervision and oversight by Government employees. No personal services shall be performed under this contract. No Contractor employee will be directly supervised by a Government employee. All individual Contractor employee assignments, and daily work direction, shall be given by the applicable employee supervisor of the Contractor. If the Contractor believes any Government action or communication has been given that would create a personal services relationship between the Government and any Contractor employee, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of this communication or action.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall not perform any inherently Governmental actions as defined by FAR 7.500. No Contractor employee shall hold him or herself out to be a Government employee, agent, or representative. No Contractor employee shall state orally or in writing at any time that he or she is acting on behalf of the Government. In all communications in connection with this contract, Contractor employees shall identify themselves as Contractor employees and specify the name of the company for which they work. In all communications with other Government Contractors in connection with this contract, the Contractor employee shall state that they have no authority to in any way change any contract and that if the other Contractor believes this communication to be a direction to change their contract, they should notify the Contracting Officer for that contract and not carry out the direction until a clarification has been issued by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure that all of its employees working on this contract are informed of the substance of this clause. Nothing in this special contract requirement shall limit the Government's rights in any way under any other term of the contract, including those related to the Government's right to inspect and accept the services to be performed under this contract. The substance of this special contract requirement shall be included in all subcontracts at any tier.</p>
<p>General Terms<br />- No on-site changes are authorized. Any required changes must be authorized by the Contracting Officer.<br />- TSA is a tax exempt Federal Agency<br />- Payment in advance is expressly prohibited and is not authorized. Payment in full will be due upon the conclusion of the event. The contractor shall submit an invoice in accordance with the contract term entitled "Invoices".</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>1. Contract Information: The Northwestern Division (NWD) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement to acquire Architect-Engineer (A-E) Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste (HTRW)/Environmental Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for execution of its environmental mission.  This contract acquisition is part of NWD's Phase A of the Multiple Environmental Government Acquisition (MEGA). These regional A-E contract acquisitions will be conducted in accordance with Public Law 92-582, the Brooks Act, and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 236.6. The majority of the work will be located within Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 2 (which includes New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and the NWD (including Kansas City, Omaha, and Seattle Districts). In support of this effort, the Government intends to award contracts to five (5) unrestricted firms sharing $150 million in total contract capacity. However, if the Contracting Officer determines during the selection process that fewer or more than five (5) contracts should be awarded, based upon the selection criteria, the Contracting Officer has the discretion of adjusting that number, or awarding none at all. <br><br>This announcement is unrestricted and open to all businesses, regardless of size. The period of performance for each contract will include a base period of three (3) years and one option period of two (2) years. It is anticipated that the contracts will be awarded not earlier than August 2011. Task orders will be issued as the need arises during the contract period. Task order assignments will be determined with consideration of each firm's experience, qualifications, past performance, capability, and capacity. These task orders may be either firm fixed-price or cost reimbursable type orders. There is no limit on the value of individual task orders and the period of performance on individual task orders shall not exceed five (5) years. Firms receiving award will share an ordering amount of $150 million over the life of the contracts. <br><br>Large businesses selected will be required to submit a subcontracting plan.  The USACE subcontracting goals, which will be considered in the negotiation of the contracts, are: a minimum of 50% of a contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with Small Businesses (SB) with 17% of that to Small Disadvantage Businesses (SDB), 18% to Women-owned Small Business (WOSB), 10% to Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZones), 8.5% to Veteran-owned, and 4% to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned SB (SDVOSB). <br><br>The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 -- Engineering Services. For the purposes of this procurement a concern is considered a small business if its average annual gross receipts are $4.5 million or less. More than one contract will be awarded for the same scope of work. Under the Brooks Act, price competition is not allowed for A-E contracts. When a requirement is identified, the government will first determine if it is a new requirement or a follow-on effort to an existing HTRW/environmental project. Due to the nature of the requirements, projects are completed in phases such as preliminary assessment, remedial investigation, feasibility study, and then design. If a follow-on requirement, determination of the selected A-E will be conducted considering a firm's experience, qualifications, capability, and capacity to perform the work. For new requirements, the project scope will be reviewed to determine whether the requirement can be accomplished using a firm fixed-price task order or whether uncertainties will require the use of a cost reimbursable task order. An evaluation will also be conducted to determine if a small business is capable of performing the work. Experience, qualifications, past performance, capability, and capacity will be considered to determine which firm is best qualified to accomplish the work. <br><br>The period of performance for the IDC will begin on the date of contract award and will be in effect for the three (3) year base period; in addition there is a provision for one two (2) year option period; if the option period is exercised, the length of the contract will be five (5) years. The period of performance for task orders awarded under the IDCs will be determined based upon the work requirement (not to exceed five (5) years) and will be included in the task order solicitation and negotiated award documents. The Service Contract Act of 1965, as Amended, is applicable to this solicitation and resulting contracts and will be incorporated into same. Service wage rates will be determined relative to the employee's office location rather than the location of work.  <br><br>To be eligible for contract award, a firm must have a D-U-N-S number from Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) and be registered in the Department of Defense (DoD) Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-866-606-8220. D&B can be reached by calling 1-866-705-5711. Firms are also required to use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the representations and certifications required by the FAR and previously found in solicitations. Detailed information can be found in the Help section of the ORCA website at http://orca.bpn.gov. The help section includes ORCA background information, frequently asked questions (FAQ), the ORCA Handbook, and whom to call for assistance. Additionally, in accordance with FAR Part 22.1303, all firms must complete their VETS-100 report. Information can be found at the Department of Labor website  http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/fcp/main.htm, or call the service center at 1-866-237-0275; you will be asked to provide your company name, employer identification number (EIN), and DUNs number.<br><br>2. Project Information: Firms must be capable of performing work on a wide variety of HTRW/environmental sites in a manner that complies with federal, state, and local regulations and laws, and within time frames required. A majority of the work to be performed is expected to be for Superfund projects in EPA Region 2. Specific needs will be determined based upon project requirements as described in each task order. Project assignments will typically require performance on-site and in an office setting. Assignments will include, but not be limited to: site investigations, subsurface exploration, chemical sampling, testing and analyses, hazard evaluations, feasibility and other engineering studies and reports, archaeological investigations and mitigation, wetlands determination and mitigation studies, groundwater and other modeling, contaminant fate and transport analysis, HTRW remedial designs, preparation of plans and specifications, cost estimating, value engineering screenings and studies, field inspections, verification of existing conditions, pilot studies, surveying and mapping, community relations, construction-phase services (engineering design during construction, checking shop drawings), evaluations of green technologies and energy conservation measures, and other related services. Selected firms will work on a variety of hazardous waste and other environmental projects, including, but not limited to: contaminated soil and groundwater, contaminated sediments, radioactive and mixed wastes, underground storage tanks and fueling systems and habitat restoration and mitigation. For on-site investigations, firms must provide personnel with current health and safety training, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).<br><br>3. Selection Criteria: (A) Selection of the firms will be based on the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance:           (1) Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm's team demonstrated during the past five (5) years in the broad range of environmental work required for this contract including (a) Investigation, planning, design, and construction phase services for a variety of hazardous, toxic, and radioactive waste cleanup projects. Experience must demonstrate wide-ranging capabilities for diverse projects with differing contaminants in various media. EPA Region 2 Superfund projects will have greater importance; (b) Knowledge of and adherence to regulations and practices pertaining to hazardous waste sampling, handling, transportation and disposal including Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), Clean Water Act (CWA), Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA), and (National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Experience within EPA Region 2 jurisdiction will have greater importance; (c) Oversight of Remedial Investigation, Feasibility Study, Remedial Design, Remedial Action, and Long Term Response Action projects performed by other parties, in conformance to their respective consent decrees or administrative orders negotiated with EPA; (d) Demonstrated quality management procedures. The effectiveness of the proposed project team (including management structure, coordination of disciplines, offices and/or subcontractors; and prior working relationships) will be considered within quality management; (e) Capability in managing cost-reimbursable contracts. The prime A-E firm will demonstrate adequate experience with a cost accounting system for cost-reimbursable contracts. Firms will be evaluated for the degree in which their team possesses experience and competence in these areas (a through e, above). The most highly qualified firms will have extensive experience in all of these areas; (2) Professional qualifications of a firm's staff and team consultants to be assigned to this contract. The education, training, registration, proposed job title, overall and relevant experience, longevity with the firm, and experience of personnel working together with key management and other technical personnel will be considered. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel, which is addressed under the capacity criterion below. Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications of their staff in these primary disciplines, which are listed in descending order of importance. List professional registrations, if applicable, for the key disciplines: (a) Project Management (b) Chemical Process Engineering; (c) Chemistry; (d) Hydrogeology ; (e) Risk Assessment; (f) Environmental Engineering (g) Civil Engineering; (h) Geotechnical Engineering; (i) Industrial Hygiene; (j) Health Physics; (k) Cost Engineering; (l) Geology; (m) Archaeology; (n) Biology; (o) Mechanical Engineering; (p) Electrical Engineering; (q) Architecture/Landscape Planning; and (r) Structural Engineering; (3 ) Past performance on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, management/business relations, and compliance with performance schedules. Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) is the primary source of information on past performance. ACASS will be queried for all firms submitting a proposal. If deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant team subcontractors who have previously been prime A-E contractors may also be considered. The board may seek information on past performance from other sources, but is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm, if none is available from ACASS. The board will consider the relevancy of each performance evaluation to the proposed contract, including the type of work, performing office, age of the evaluation, and whether subsequent evaluations indicate a change in a firm's performance. A firm that has earned excellent evaluations on recent DoD A-E contracts for similar size, scope, and complexity of projects will be ranked relatively high on past performance; (4) Capacity. The board will consider available capacity of key disciplines identified above from the prime firm and its team consultants to perform work in the required time; (5) Knowledge of the locality. The board will evaluate a firm's familiarity with local conditions. Examples include knowledge of, and experience dealing with, the state and local regulatory agencies, geological features, climatic conditions or local construction methods that are unusual or unique. Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispersed geographic area, therefore, responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities to serve projects located in both EPA Region 2 and the USACE NWD. (B) Secondary Selection Criteria. The following secondary criteria will only be used as a tie-breaker, if necessary, in ranking the most highly qualified firms. The secondary criteria will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation. The two secondary selection criteria are listed in descending order of importance: (1) SB and SDB Participation. The extent of participation of SB, SDB, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minority institutions ( MI) will be measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU, or MI is a prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner; the greater the participation, the greater the consideration. Large businesses will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with Small and Small Disadvantaged firms in accordance with Public Law 95-507. For informational purposes, the small business size is defined by the limits of NAICS Code 541330.   (2) Volume of DoD A-E Contract Awards in the last 12 months. Responding firms should cite all contract numbers, award dates and total negotiated fees for any DoD A-E contract awarded within the past twelve (12) months. Please indicate all task orders and modifications awarded your firm by DoD agencies within the last twelve (12) months under an indefinite delivery type contract. Indicate date of task orders and fee for each. This information will assist in effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms, including SB and SDB. <br><br>4. Submittal Requirements:  Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit one (1) original plus five (5) copies of SF 330 (06/2004 edition) for the prime firm and all team consultants. Include the firm's DUNS number in SF 330, Part I, Section B, Block 4. For the ten (10) projects submitted in Section F of the SF 330, a "project" is defined as work performed pursuant to one specific task order of an IDC at one site or multiple sites at a single installation or facility, or work performed pursuant to a site-specific contract for one site or multiple sites within a single installation or facility.  An IDC, or the performance of work pursuant to multiple task orders of an IDC, does not represent a "project" within this definition. If the offeror provides a specific task order as its "project," it shall provide the base contract number and the task order number for reference purposes. If the offeror provides a site-specific contract as its "project," it shall provide the contract number for reference purposes. Firms should include information regarding the Secondary Selection Criteria in Section H of the SF 330. Section H is limited to twenty (20) pages with double-sided sheets counting as two pages. For all SF 330 sections, use no smaller than 10 pt. font. No spiral bound documents shall be submitted. Solicitation packages are not provided. This is not a request for proposal.<br> <br>Submittals must be mailed or delivered to the following address not later than July 1, 2011, 4:00 pm Central Time (no faxed or other electronic submittals will be accepted):<br><br>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District <br>Attn: CECT-NWK-H (Stephanie Randall) <br>601 East 12th Street<br>Kansas City, MO 64106-2896<br><br>(816) 389-3965<br><br>Submit questions, in writing only, to Stephanie Randall at stephanie.d.randall@usace.army.mil.  <br><br>Synopsis also provided in a PDF format.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12 and 15, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-11-Q-200038 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 339991. The small business size standard is 500 employees. This is an unrestricted solicitation. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a Firm-Fixed Price Requirements contract shall be awarded on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation consisting of one (1) one-year base period and four (4) one-year option periods. The total duration of this contract shall not exceed five (5) years. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Aviation Devices and Electronic Components (AVDEC). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AVDEC is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. The information submitted must include a letter from the OEM verifying the offeror is an authorized distributor, and verifying the OEM will supply only genuine OEM parts. Upon receipt of more than one offer, offers will be competed and an award will be made to the responsible offeror who submits the lowest price, technically acceptable offer with acceptable or neutral past performance.</p>
<p><strong>The estimated quantity/parts list is attached in an Excel file titled "HSCG38-11-Q-200038 Quote Sheet" to be used to submit your quote.</strong></p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), or a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures. The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance (COC) in accordance with FAR 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause.</p>

<DESC>This amendment is to answer questions that have come up since the solicitation was originally posted:<br><br>Q1. What is the primary age range of children that will be attending this event?<br><br>A1. Ages 9-16<br><br>Q2. Special needs cover a wide range of both cognitive and physical disabilities. Depending on the special need impacts the staffing levels. Do you have more clarification?<br><br>A2.  The camp must be able to handle some special needs and not automatically say no to youth with special needs who want to attend. At this time we have no way of knowing who will register and if that will mean the need for a one-on-one or anything. The camp shall allow children who need redirection and extra support in a camp environment. There is not a need for facilities for youth with physical handicaps. Not all military children are "special needs" but they do have special circumstances that need to be understood and shall be addressed on a case by case basis.<br><br>Q3. Do you have any specific dates in mind or is it any week in the July - Aug 2011 time period?<br><br>A3. July is strongly preferred however dates in August will be considered.<br><br>Also, being that this is a week of camp exclusively for military youth, the camp shall not integrate the military youth with children from the general public. The camp does not have to be entirely closed to the general public, however the military youth shall be isolated to meet the program's objectives.<br>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12 and 15, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-11-Q-200038 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 339991. The small business size standard is 500 employees. This is an unrestricted solicitation. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a Firm-Fixed Price Requirements contract shall be awarded on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation consisting of one (1) one-year base period and four (4) one-year option periods. The total duration of this contract shall not exceed five (5) years. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Aviation Devices and Electronic Components (AVDEC). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AVDEC is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. The information submitted must include a letter from the OEM verifying the offeror is an authorized distributor, and verifying the OEM will supply only genuine OEM parts. Upon receipt of more than one offer, offers will be competed and an award will be made to the responsible offeror who submits the lowest price, technically acceptable offer with acceptable or neutral past performance.</p>
<p><strong>The estimated quantity/parts list is attached in an Excel file titled "HSCG38-11-Q-200038 Quote Sheet" to be used to submit your quote.</strong></p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), or a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures. The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance (COC) in accordance with FAR 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause.</p>
<p><strong>NO SUBSITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. ONLY NEW APPROVED PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED. </strong></p>
<p><strong>NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.</strong></p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the Agency. <strong>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 30 Jun 2011, 4:30 p.m., EST.</strong> Anticipated award date is on or about 18 October 2011. E-mail quotes are preferred and may be sent to Tony.R.Twiddy@uscg.mil . Please indicate HSCG38-11-Q-200038 in subject line.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

With his/her quote the Contractor shall provide the necessary welding certifications and qualifications as required by the specification for the applicable work item(s), and SFLC Standard Specification 0740_STD. <br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: QUOTES MUST INCLUDE ALL DOCUMENTS REQUESTED IN THIS SOLICITATION (WELDING CERTIFICATES, DRYDOCK CALCULATIONS, PAST PERFORMANCE, ETC). QUOTES THAT DO NOT INCLUDE ALL DOCUMENTS REQUESTED MAY BE CONSIDERED INCOMPLETE AND MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED.<br /><br />GROWTH WORK<br /><br />(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.<br />(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.<br />(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.<br />COMPOSITE LABOR RATE: -The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.<br />(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing<br />(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.<br />(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.<br />CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY --No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.<br />CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT -The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), SFLC Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COTR. The COTR will comment on the Contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the Contractor and Availability Program Manager. The Contracting Officer will render a final determination and provide it to the Contractor and COTR in writing.<br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time-consuming litigation. Potential quoters who believe that a Coast Guard solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the quoter should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />United States Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3695<br />Fax: (202) 475-3904</p>
<p>Potential quoters should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: Solicitation number, Contracting Office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date. Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) Rating: DO A3.</p>

<DESC>I have attached contractor performance reference sheets to this notice and will require 3 of these to be returned.

A couple of questions were brought out at the bid opening.

1.  Out of the approximate 35 VAV terminal units, how many are pneumatically controlled and how many are DDC electronically controlled?

All existing VAV terminal units to be worked under this contract are DDC/electronic.

2.  What local indications are desired for conditions in the spaces and are we concerned enough about pressure relationships to warrant audible alarms?

Local displays in all spaces served should indicate temperature.  Displays in the 5 operating rooms should also indicate humidity.  Differential pressure and air flow should be monitored for the 5 operating rooms with pressure alarms and air exchange data displayed on the building automation system front end/remote control terminals.

<p style="text-align: justify;">(c) Upon request, providing a copy of a reasonably described record.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">24.202 Prohibitions. <br />(a) A proposal in the possession or control of the Government, submitted in response to a competitive solicitation, shall not be made available to any person under the Freedom of Information Act. This prohibition does not apply to a proposal, or any part of a proposal, that is set forth or incorporated by reference in a contract between the Government and the contractor that submitted the proposal. (See 10 U.S.C. 2305(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253b(m).)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(b) No agency shall disclose any information obtained pursuant to 15.403-3(b) that is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. (See 10 U.S.C. 2306a(d)(2)(C) and 41 U.S.C. 254b(d)(2)(C).)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">(b) Contracting officers may receive requests for records that may be exempted from mandatory public disclosure. The exemptions most often applicable are those relating to classified information, to trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information, to interagency or intra-agency memoranda, or to personal and medical information pertaining to an individual. Other exemptions include agency personnel practices, and law enforcement. Since these requests often involve complex issues requiring an in-depth knowledge of a large and increasing body of court rulings and policy guidance, contracting officers are cautioned to comply with the implementing regulations of their agency and to obtain necessary guidance from the agency officials having Freedom of Information Act responsibility. If additional assistance is needed, authorized agency officials may contact the Department of Justice, Office of Information and Privacy.

<DESC>The purpose of amendment three (3) is to answer questions submitted by prospective offerors. Questions and answers are as follows:
<p>Question #1:<br />How much lead time will be given to offerors to coordinate and schedule travel plans for oral presentations?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />The solicitation is due to end on Thursday, 26 May 2011 at 4:00 pm ES. Oral presentations are scheduled for the week starting Monday, 13 June 2011. Depending on the number of offers received, oral presentations are tentatively scheduled to start on Monday, 13 June 2011 and last until Friday, 17 June 2011. The exact schedule for oral presentations and the order in which offerors will present has yet to be decided. If you intend to submit an offer and would like to request a day to present (or a day that you cannot present) between the dates of 13 June 2011 and 17 June 2011, then please do so and the Government will try to honor that request. Scheduling will start as soon as possible in order to allow for out-of-town offerors to make travel plans.</p>
<p>Question #2:<br />Can the Government clarify when Client Authorization Letters and Past Performance Questionnaires are due?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />A contradiction occurred in the solicitation. Section L.12, paragraph (e)(2) of the solicitation states that "Client Authorization Letters should be mailed or E-mailed to individual references no later than five (5) working days after proposal submission"; whereas, Attachment 2, Client Authorization Letter and Attachment 3, Past Performance Questionnaire states that "The EPA has requested receipt of this information by close of business 24 May 2011."</p>
<p>The correct information for document submittal is as follows:</p>
<p>As stated in Section L.2 of the solicitation, Client Authorization Letter(s) should be mailed or E-mailed to individual references no later than five (5) working days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>Receipt of Past Performance Questionnaires is requested by Thursday, 9 June 2011.</p>
<p>Question #3:<br />With regard to Section M.3, under QUALIFICATIONS OF PERSONNEL, the solicitation states, "Offerers shall specifically address the expertise and experience of proposed individuals for the conducting of quality systems assessments and in the type of scientific activity they will be assessing." Can the Government clarify what is meant by this statement?<br /><br />Answer:<br />The statement is meant to relate to the experience of the offeror's personnel in ensuring quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) in the work they have performed. In addition to providing the qualifications of Key Personnel and other Non-key Personnel, proposed by offerors to provide support as described in the Statement of Work (SOW), offerors shall provide the expertise and experience of their personnel as it relates to QA/QC.</p>
END OF AMENDMENT 3<br /><br />The purpose of amendment two (2) is to answer questions submitted by prospective offerors.&nbsp; Questions and answers are as follows:
<p>Question 1.<br />Can you clarify the FIFRA requirements under this solicitation?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />An understanding of FIFRA, what it entails, and how it applies to this requirement can be found in the Section H provisions EPAAR 1552.235-73 and EPAAR 1552.235-77; the law and regulatory guidance provided in Section L.2 http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/regulating/laws.htm; and within the FIFRA Information Security Manual http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/1100002/sec.pdf.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />What is the RFP response date for this solicitation?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />As stated in Section L.15, the specified date and time for receipt of proposals is 26 May 2011 by 4:00 pm ES.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />When are oral presentations scheduled?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />Oral presentations are tentatively scheduled for the week of 13 June 2011.</p>
END OF AMENDMENT 2<br /><br />The purpose of this amendment to this announcement is to provide the link to the Request for Proposal (RFP) which is now available on EPA's website at the following address:
<p>http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/1100002/index.htm<br /><br />Any updates to this procurement, including amendments to the solicitation, questions and answers, and other procurement-related documents will be available at the aforementioned website. It is the responsibility of interested parties to regularly monitor the EPA website for all future updates to this procurement.<br /><br />*NOTE* - The Sources Sought Notice for this requirement was previously listed under reference number SOL-DC-11-00002. THIS REFERENCE NUMBER IS NO LONGER VALID. The current and correct reference number for this requirement is SOL-DC-11-00011.<br /><br />END OF AMENDMENT 1<br /><br />The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for a new mission support contract for the Biological and Economic Analysis Division (BEAD) for assistance in providing economic and biological support of Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) regulatory development. Specifically, support is required in conducting economic analyses (EA) of pesticide related rulemaking, economic and biological analyses (EBA) on individual and/or groups of pesticides affected under EPA regulatory actions, and analyses of policies and actions to reduce pesticide usage and risk.</p>
<p>This is NOT a solicitation. This is a pre-solicitation notice in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.2-Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions.</p>
<p>The proposed requirement mentioned herein will be solicited as a full and open competition. The successful offeror shall be prepared to provide scientific/technical support for EPA activities in furtherance of the Agency's primary mission-the protection of human health and the environment. The work to be performed under the Statement of Work (SOW) falls under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, with a Small Business Size Standard of $7 million. Interested firms must be able to meet the requirements, as stated in the SOW under the provided NAICS code. A draft SOW is posted on the following webpage:</p>
<p>http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/1100002/draftsow.pdf</p>
<p>In order to be awarded a contract under this requirement, a contractor and any sub-contractor(s) who will possibly require access to Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) confidential business information (CBI) must have the ability to receive and maintain FIFRA clearance. In addition, the contractor must demonstrate their ability to obtain FIFRA clearance. A contractor will not be eligible for contract award if they are part of the FIFRA regulated community.</p>
<p>Following this notice, and in response to the eventual publication of a request for proposal (RFP), all responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is valued at approximately $4 million. The resultant contract is anticipated to be Cost Plus Fixed-Fee, in accordance with the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15-Contracting by Negotiation. The resultant contract is anticipated to have a 12-month base period and the possibility of four (4), 12-month option periods. The estimated level of effort (LOE) is five thousand (5,000) hours per performance period with an option for an increased LOE, for each performance period, up to seven thousand five hundred (7,500) hours of work. Work may be ordered through the issuance of work assignments. The contractor shall provide all personnel, materials, and equipment necessary to perform the tasks stated in the SOW.</p>
<p>These EBA services are currently provided by the incumbent, Abt Associates, Inc., under contract EPW06083. Notwithstanding the Government's option to exercise term extensions, the current contract listed above is scheduled to expire 31 August 2011.</p>

The Cold Sky Reflector is a parabolic reflector that provides a view of cold (~2.7 K) space that is collected and processed by the spacecraft's systems. The measurements from the Cold Sky Reflector enable the systems to calibrate on each scan. The Specifications are export controlled under the International Traffic In Arms Regulation (ITAR). As such, in order to receive the referenced specifications, potential contractors must complete the attached certification&nbsp;and send&nbsp;proof of status&nbsp;as a US Person (as defined in 22 C.F.R. Part 120.15) and submit it via email to Kirsten Pilkerton at kirsten.pilkerton@nrl.navy.mil. Upon confirmation of eligibility and the release of the solicitation, potential offerors will be sent copies of the statement of work and specifications. The statement of work and specifications must be safeguarded and protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with applicable US export control laws and regulations. It is anticipated that a&nbsp;Firm Fixed Price&nbsp;contract will be made as a result of the solicitation. NRL uses Electronic Commerce (EC) to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided. The actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued. <br />
<p>All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The work includes the construction of an approximately 720 foot earth channel between the end of an existing concrete box culvert and Kennedy Avenue, including demolition of miscellaneous features, clearing and grubbing, constructing new steel channel walls and anchorages adjacent to the existing box culvert, earthwork for the channel, deep soil mixing, and stone channel base material. An existing 90-inch diameter sanitary effluent outfall main is to be relocated, while remaining active; including the use of pile supported temporary and permanent piping. The work also includes construction vibration monitoring and control, site drainage, pavements, fencing, pile tests and incidental related work.<BR>The project work occurs in three general phases. The objective of Phase 1, Exploratory Excavation and Preparation, is to locate and document the existing outfall main so that a new relocated main can be accurately constructed. Work in this phase includes: clearing and grubbing along with degrading portions of the site; cutting off flows of surface water into the site by plugging the existing box culvert near one end of the work area and building an earthen berm near the other end; determining precise location and elevations of the existing outfall main; and installing a cofferdam and bracing system along with protective measures adjacent to the outfall main. In Phase 2, Sanitary Outfall Main Relocation, the objective is to construct a new main along an alignment below the new channel while keeping effluent flows continuous. Work in this phase includes: providing a temporary bypass main including taps, line stopping and diverting flows to the bypass main; demolishing portions of the existing main and constructing a permanent main following the new profile below the channel; deep soil mixing and backfilling of areas adjacent to the permanent main; diverting flows to the permanent main; and removal of the bypass main. Phase 3, Slope Stabilization and Finishing, involves performing the remaining work activities for a complete and functional project. Work in this phase includes: additional deep soil mixing for stabilization of the new channel; providing the wing walls and anchorage system at the end of the existing box culvert; constructing the new earthen channel with stone channel base material; removing portions of the cofferdam; constructing local drainage features, pavements, and fencing; removing the temporary earth berm and box culvert plug; and miscellaneous construction and closeout activities. The estimated period of performance is 730 calendar days after receipt of the Notice to Proceed. Magnitude of construction is between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00. PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS: Award will be made to the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) proposal. Proposals will be evaluated on technical, past performance and price.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND RESPONSE #2:<br><br>1. Travel CLIN - we noted that there was no dollar value assigned to the travel CLINs for the Base and Option years. Will the government automatically fund this line item at contract award, or is the offeror required to submit an estimated cost for each Period of Performance?<br>Additionally, the Period of Performance (PoP) for travel does not match the PoP for the respective CLINs for services. For example, for base period, the travel period covers 1 Aug 11 to 30 Sep 11, and then for all the all option years the periods covered are from 1 Apr to 30 Sep for each year. This leaves a full 6-month travel gap for each of the option years.... was this so intended for the solicitation...?<br><br>RESPONSE:  The government will provide dollars for the travel CLIN.  Money spent on travel has to be expended during the same fiscal year as the fiscal year of the money provided.  The first period of this contact will be funded with FY11 money.  Travel money can only be spent during the first two months for this eight month period because they are within FY11.  All follow- on option years start on 1 April, so travel funding can only be spent from 1 April thru 30 September.  And, yes, it was our intention to leave a full 6-month travel gap for each of the option years.<br><br>2. On Page 41 of the solicitation there is an imbedded PDF file, which is the Business System Course Schedule.  This Business System Course Schedule in no shape or form corresponds to the courses delineated and spelled-out on pages 21-22 in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Please clarify which courses are in fact required in addition to the providing the project schedules of the respective courses.  Also, according to Page 22 of the PWS, as many as seven simultaneous courses may occur at one and the same time...would the level of effort here then require the offeror to maintain at least seven full-time employees...?  If the answer is no or unanswerable, what RATIO of full-time to part-time employees would you then expect...?<br><br>RESPONSE:  The second Paragraph of Section 1.2 lists the Battle Command Systems and AMEDD Business Systems that will be taught and this corresponds with the matrix, therefore all courses are required.  Class times vary and are dictated by the Program Manager for a course of instruction.  For instance, FBCB2 may be taught at the same time as AKO.   Also class sizes are different.  You may have more than 100 students at a time.  If there is hands-on computer work then that type of instruction requires small group instruction.  If there are multiple classes going on at one time and/or the number of instructors needed due to small group instruction exceeds 7, then that will be augmented by personnel from the government.  We do not intend to provide the level of effort for this requirement.<br>   <br>3. Proposal format - the solicitation is non-descript as to the both media and format for proposal transmittal; e.g., may we submit the proposal electronically to you via e-mail; in-person by hand delivery; courier/postal service; or perhaps simply upload the proposal via your AFSI web portal...?<br>Also what media format will you require for each section or volume -- e.g., PDF, Excel spreadsheet, Word documents, etc.  Finally, are there any page limitations for any of the sections or volumes of the proposal?<br><br>RESPONSE:  Please read the solicitation 52.212-1, the instructions on your proposal submittal.<br><br>4. Service Contract Act - we noticed that there is no explicit or declarative statement that this solicitation is in fact governed by the Service Contact Act. Will the Service Contract Act then apply to this solicitation?<br><br>RESPONSE:  Yes, Service Contract Act does apply to this solicitation.  Please refer to Exhibit A for the applicable wage determination that is part of the solicitation.    <br><br>5. Lastly, based on these questions, which affect scope and delivery schedule of our proposal, would the government entertain a two-week extension to the due date...?<br><br>RESPONSE:  No, we do not contemplate extending the proposal due date.<br><br><br>

CACI is the only source capable of providing the necessary continuation of these services without causing a break in support.<br />In accordance with FAR 16.301-2, all tasking for this effort will be CPFF due to the uncertainties in contract performance.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS NETWORK 22 CONTRACTING ACTIVITY
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-5, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2)

1.	Contracting Activity: The Department of Veteran Affairs, VISN 22 Network Contracting   Activity, as directed by the VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS) has a requirement for a research and development contract, which will require justification for other than full and open competition.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  Sole source Contractor shall provide Post Traumatic Syndrome Disorder (PTSD) research for the VASDHS under the terms and conditions of a service contract.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: VASDHS is requesting a sole source service contract for a PTSD Marine research study from Eureka Corporate Capitol pursuant to 38 U.S.C.  8127(c) and the provisions of Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Acquisition and Material Management (OA&MM) Public Law 108-183, Veterans Benefits Act of 2003. The period of performance is June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012 with the Government's option to extend two additional years.  The estimated for cost for is $271,370.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The service is being procured under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 FAR Part 6.302-5 Authorized by Statute.

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): Eureka Corporate Capital, a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business is uniquely qualified based upon the following: 

(a)	Eureka Corporate Capital has over twenty-two years of military experience with the US Marine Corps, attended the Air Support's Contract Officer's Course at MCCES, Twenty-nine Palms, CA, assigned to the Marine Air Control Group-38, Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, CA and took command of Marine Air Support Squadron-3 at Camp Pendleton.  The Marine Resiliency Study assesses participants out of Camp Pendleton and Twenty-nine Palms on PTSD. During Eureka Corporate Capital military career, he has participated in combat operations during Desert Shield/Desert Storm, and Operations Restore Hope in Somalia which provided an in depth understanding of PTSD.

(b)	 PTSD and acute stress disorder are now widely recognized, as experiences that provoke terror, horror, or helplessness.  No prospective, longitudinal studies have been performed to assess the impact of combat and other operational military stressors.  Therefore, the ability to predict how the stressors of war affect the mental health of this generation of soldiers is limited.  VASDHS and the Marine Corps have aggressively worked to address adverse stress reactions through comprehensive Combat Operational Stress Control (COSC) programs that encompass planning, implementing, and training for prevention, identification, and treatment of combat stress outcomes, such as PTSD.  Development of prevention and intervention programs depends upon a comprehensive knowledge of risk factors for stress injuries and illnesses among deploying ground combatants, including factors that predict trajectories of post-combat mental and

physical function.  However, because prior research has been retrospective, cross-sectional are predominantly focused on single systems, and knowledge has been limited.  This recognition 
led to the initiation of the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS), funded to evaluate the physical, family, social, and mental health status of ground combat Marines prior to deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan.

(c)	This research was previously conducted; however the SDVOSB resigned which resulted in a Termination for Default of the contract. This research study was sent to Congress in March of 2011 which advocates the medical community for better diagnostic and increased treatment options for Marines with severe injuries including PTSD. An unresolved problem for the VASDHS is the increase in suicides among Marines and soldiers.  In an effort to better understand risks and causes for these suicides, the MRS study was initiated. MRS will provide an early analysis of predictors of mental health outcomes and suicidal rates that correlate with Marines participating in MRS.

(d)	Any interruptions in data collections will hinder the success of the study.  Eureka Corporate Capital shall be the primary liaison between base command, battalion command, marines and the study's personnel.  The Contractor has the resources and ability to coordinate with the Marine Line Command at 29 Palms and Pendleton, and Marine Bases to prepare for pre-deployment and post deployment data collections, track status (injury, transfer, separation) of Marines enrolled in the study and schedule for post-deployment data collection. The Contractor shall assure coordination with unit deployment schedules, procurement of space, introduce the study to officers and battalions regarding participation in study.   Additionally, the Contractor shall provide military education to all staff (compile appropriate materials and deliver PowerPoint presentations to educate personnel on the study of military culture).  Any delay in continual research will alter the validity of data that was collected, cause an undesired variable, and will increase the impact the health and welfare of active military service persons and veteran beneficiaries.  

6.	 A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From are Solicited from as Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable:  See item Number 5 above.  A notice was transmitted to the GPE (FedBizOpps) from April 13, 2011 through April 22, 2011. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: The anticipated cost should be fair and reasonable to the government based on the using service estimate and past contract for the same service.There is no fluctuation in prices as this is the flat service rate.  

8.	 Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted: Market research information was obtained through VetBiz and a sources sought notice was issued.  Two companies replied to the sources sought, however, they lack the ability to access the military base, have no prior military experience, and are not located within the surrounding areas of the military base. See Item Number 5 above. 

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None.

FAR 6.302-5, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2)

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed in Writing an Interest in the Acquisition: Sources have expressed in writing an interest in the service but are not qualified for this service.  See Item Number 8.

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: The anticipated life of the research is ongoing, as there is no timeframe on PTSD.  The Government plans to find possible cures on PTSD to decrease the suicide rate. The Government cannot overcome barriers of competition, at this time, because PTSD in regards to military is an ongoing battle. However, through research studies, it can be maintained and have less of an impact to active military service persons, and veteran benificiaries.

Requirements Certification: I certify that the requirement outlines in the justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
