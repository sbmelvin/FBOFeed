In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8253. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable.
20.   Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to the buyer Addison Crabtree, 405-739-9633, addison.crabtree@us.af.mil.

Bell Helicopter Textron Incorporated (BHTI) and Flight Safety International (FSI) are the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) for these training systems.
 All devices were initially procured using other than full and open competition through issuance of authorized sole source contracts to BHTI (with FSI as the main subcontractor). All of the existing UH-1Y and AH-1Z Training Devices that are part of this effort were delivered with, and currently operate using, a propriety visual system known as the FSI VITAL system (currently the VITAL 1100 system). The VITAL 1100 run-time format databases are the only known databases capable of correctly integrating and operating in the current visual systems utilized by the H-1 devices in order to properly display dynamic and moving models (rocket fire, ground personnel, own ship, etc.), aircraft, vehicles, cultural features, airports, landing zones, and weather patterns/effects that are all essential for aircrew training.
 
The VITAL 1100 format and the database generation systems (necessary to develop database content, functionality, etc.) were developed exclusively by FSI. The Government neither has possession nor rights to software and database generation systems capable of developing enhanced VITAL 1100 databases. Ongoing market research performed by the Government supports that there does not exist a commercially available item or non-developmental item to satisfy the Governments requirement, therefore this acquisition will be sole source. 

This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firms believing that they can fulfill the requirement of providing this VITAL 1100 run-time visual database may be considered by the agency.
 It must clearly show the firms ability to be responsive without compromising the quality, accuracy, and reliability of theses training systems provided and without causing programmatic hardship. The Government will consider written and/or electronic media responses to this announcement no later than 0900 EST, 20 October 2017 and can be submitted to Sara Robinson Contract Specialist at sara.robinson@navy.mil. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to award a sole source follow-on bridge contract to McKean Defense Group, LLC., located at One Crescent Drive, Suite 400, Philadelphia, PA 19112-1015, to continue providing support services to SEA 21, Surface Maintenance Engineering Planning Program (SURFMEPP). Requirements for this support include critical engineering services and administrative service support for lifecycle maintenance.
<p>The current support services contract, SeaPort-e Task Order N00178-04-D-4078-EH01, ends on October 31, 2017. The follow-on competition was awarded and then protested, leaving a gap with no support services.  The intent of this follow-on bridge is to fill that anticipated gap. The bridge contract will include a three (3) month base period with three (3) additional one (1) month options, totaling 6 months, if all options are exercised. This contract will be awarded pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B), which allows an agency to restrict competition when services are deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued provisions of highly specialized services, when it is likely that an award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  No other source has the capability to perform the work described herein in the time frame required to meet NAVSEA's operational needs without resulting in unacceptable delays and a substantial duplication of costs. The follow-on contract was awarded competitively within SeaPort-e.</p>

<p>All interested parties are encouraged to submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than 5 pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, a budgetary estimate of test articles, production units, production quantity breaks, mitigate the reason why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole source basis as stated above, and /or identify other Government contracts with similar efforts for the Government(s) consideration.</p>

<p>Submitter's Name<br />Street Address, City, State, Zip Code<br />Business Size<br />Point of Contact (POC)<br />POC Telephone<br />Announcement Number: N00164-18-R-WM09</p>

<p>This is not a solicitation, but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist and to assist in determining if this effort can be considered competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 336413, which has a corresponding size standard of 1,250 employees. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in all small businesses, to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned Small Business concerns. The Government requests that interested parties respond to this notice and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide in your response any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers within the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</p>
<p>This notification is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Responses will not be returned. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), a response to this notice is not an offer and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with their response. Not responding to this inquiry will not preclude participation in any future Request for Proposal (RFP), if issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be publicized in accordance with the requirements of the FAR.</p>

<p>The objective is to provide quality upgrades to the existing Western Range Command Destruct equipment through procurement of hardware and software that is tri-mode capable Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS) with 10 kW transmit power that meet range safety requirements within the timeframe of the National Security Agency (NSA) mandate of 2020. The upgrade of highly specialized equipment will be identical to the recent modernization effort accomplished at the Eastern Range. These new Command Destruct System elements will provide the functionality of the existing Command Destruct System, plus add the new EFTS capability to support Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) launches. The EFTS capability is being added because the NSA will no longer support High Alphabet (HA) code generation. The HA capability will exist in the new system as it must be designed to support the transition from HA to EFTS until HA is retired by the NSA.</p>

12. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES:

A. Contractor shall be liable to the Government for losses of production due to significant equipment downtime.  Significant equipment downtime is that which exceeds ten (10) hours/month.  Records regarding downtime will be kept by the COR and the maintenance contractor.

B. Equipment downtime is calculated only from those normal hours of coverage (see Hours of Coverage Section) that the scheduled equipment is not fully operational.  Downtime will begin when the Contractor is required to be on site (see Unscheduled Maintenance Section response time definition) after notification by the CO, COR or designated alternate.  Downtime will accumulate until the scheduled equipment is returned to full and usual operation and accepted as such by the CO, COR or designated alternate.  This does not include scheduled maintenance for PM purposes or when waiting for VA furnished tubes.  Refusal of access to the equipment indicates that the unit is up and running and this time will not be considered when determining downtime.  Refusal of access to the equipment voids the service call.

C. If downtime exceeds sixteen (16] consecutive hours, the CO may exercise the option to hire an alternate source to resolve the problem.  The decision to exercise this alternative will reside exclusively with the CO.  All fees generated by the alternate Contractor(s) will be handled in accordance with Default clause.

D. Monies will be subtracted from the contract if the Contractor fails to meet the up-time requirements using the following formula:

MONTHLY        MONTHS
DOWNTIME

10 - 11 hours/month   0%

12 - 13 hours/month   20%

14 - 15 hours/month   40%

16 - 17 hours/month   60%

18 - 19 hours/month   80%

20 or more hours/month   100%

These will be computed for the monthly dollar totals.


PAYMENT: - Invoices will be paid in arrears on a quarterly basis. Invoices, MUST INCLUDE, at a minimum, the following information: Contract No., Purchase Order No., Item(s) covered (to include serial #'s) by the PMI and covered period of service.  Each invoice must be provided in triplicate.

14. ADDITIONAL CHARGES: - There will be no additional charge for time spent at the site (during, or after the normal hours of coverage) awaiting the arrival of additional FSE and/or delivery of parts.

15. REPORTING REQUIRED SERVICES BEYOND THE CONTRACT SCOPE: - The Contractor shall immediately, but no later than 24 (twenty-four) consecutive hours after discovery, notify the CO and COR (in writing) of the existence or the development of any defects in, or repairs required, to the scheduled equipment which the Contractor considers he/she is not responsible for under the terms of the contract.  The Contractor shall furnish the CO and COR with a written estimate of the cost to make necessary repairs.

16. CONDITION OF EQUIPMENT: - The Contractor accepts responsibility for the equipment in "as is" condition.  Failure to inspect the equipment prior to contract award will not relieve the Contractor from performance of the requirements of this contract.

17. COMPETENCY OF PERSONNEL SERVICING EQUIPMENT:

A. Each respondent must have an established business, with an office and full time staff.  The staff includes a "fully qualified" FSE and a "fully qualified" FSE who will serve as the backup.

B. "Fully Qualified" is based upon training and on experience in the field.  For training, the FSE(s) has successfully completed a formalized training program, for the equipment.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in October.   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />The Open Period for October* is October 3, 2018 to October 23, 2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2018 or until it is replaced.
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and  each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 18-REG03 and must be located within Region 3.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought only. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is performing market research to determine if there are any vendors with economic status of Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Veteran Owned, Women Owned, and other Small Businesses that can provide services of an Outpatient Social Model Detoxification Program for Veterans in the Fresno, CA area.   The projected period of performance is March 01, 2018 through February 28, 2022. The socio-economic status of the responders will determine the type of set-aside, if any. 

Summary of Work
Patients appropriate for ambulatory detoxification will be determined by a medical provider (Registered Nurse, Physician Assistant, Nurse Practitioner, and Physician) after a history and medical evaluation is completed. If the patient is found to meet criteria for Ambulatory Detoxification, they will be provided care depending on their individual needs and the clinical judgment of the treating provider. Patients will be prescribed daily doses of medication and will be expected to return for close follow-up evaluation for a minimum of 5-7 days, depending on their individual medical needs.  The patient will also be evaluated for participation in Group Therapy with the SUDP throughout the detoxification process. At the completion of the detoxification, the patient will have developed a plan in conjunction with SUDP personnel regarding longer-term treatment.  If at any time during the detoxification, the patient's medical condition deteriorates; or if the patient is unable to abstain from substances, the patient will be considered for admission for inpatient detoxification

<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The Government acknowledges its obligations under the Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. &sect;1905) to not divulge, release, or disclose information qualifying as "PROPRIETARY" under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any trade secret or proprietary restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:</p>
<p>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or proprietary with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.<br />2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<br />3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.<br />4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the Government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends "PROPRIETARY DATA BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."<br />5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<br />6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, proprietary material may receive limited or no evaluation because the Government shall extract proprietary information from response packages reviewed by support contractors that assist the evaluation effort.</p>

<DESC><p>The Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service, on behalf of the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Funds, has made a logical follow-on award to Transformation Strategies, 5200 Baltimore Avenue, Suite 200, Hyattsville, MD 20781-2006, for another Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for three years against their GSA Federal Supply Schedule OOCORP contract to continue to provide integrated consulting services to facilitate action planning, organization development, and skill building in response to Employee Viewpoint Survey results, bearing in mind the trend in results since 2010 and the methods created under the prior awarded BPA. Pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C).</p>
<p>Transformation Strategies has all of the background, experience, and knowledge of the aforementioned foundation identified under the prior awarded BPA that no other company possesses to continue to engage the organization leaders in the next steps of the project in streamlining and building on the 2015 results through the methodology they established with the CDFI Fund to continue to improve in the areas that need attention to satisfy the agency's original need, which accrues to the benefit of the Government. It would take extensive time to transfer the experience and knowledge of the aforementioned foundation and methodology to another company, which would increase project schedule, cost associated with duplication of efforts and delays, and performance risk. The prior awarded BPA with Transformation Strategies, Inc. was awarded on a competitive basis. Therefore, the logical follow-on award is considered to be in the Government's interest of economy and efficiency and is authorized.</p>
<p>This posting satisfies the posting requirement stated in FAR Subpart 8.405-6(a)(2)(i).</p>
<p>Responses to this posting will only be considered as market research for future similar requirements.</p>

<DESC>NASA JSC seeks to advance Digitally Based Immersive Systems (DBIS) that include Hybrid Reality (HR), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR) systems to support human spaceflight activities related to operations, training, engineering design/analysis, analogs, and human health in space.  Astronauts, ground support personnel, engineers, and scientists require tools that allow them to carry out these activities, while helping to reduce schedules, risks, costs, and in some instances provide capabilities not currently available to them.  DBIS how been shown to be very useful in these application areas.  Additionally, some DBIS also incorporate sound, haptics, and other sensory information to further augment the realism and immersion provided.  As DBIS replace physical mockups for some activities and electronic procedures replace paper checklists for others, there is an opportunity for a wide assortment of DBIS technologies to help support human spaceflight.<br /><br />Technology:<br />Specific domain expertise and interest areas include:<br />&#9679; DBIS technologies combined with electronic procedures, and spatially tracked: 3D printed tools, real" physical tools, and other objects;<br />&#9679; Electronic procedures authoring tools for training and performance support;<br />&#9679; Use of DBIS and procedure assistant for Just-In-Time Training (JITT), operations, training, engineering design/analysis, analogs, and human health activities;<br />&#9679; DBIS architecture development for distributed computing paradigms;<br />&#9679; Inside-out (e.g. machine vision) and outside-in (e.g. lighthouse) tracking for object/human tracking and registration<br />&#9679; Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) localization and logistics management;<br />&#9679; Wearable computing (e.g. gloves) and sensor fusion technology for Automation and Robotics (A&amp;R)<br />&#9679; DBIS interactive control of virtual and real objects with gesture, voice, haptics, and other methods; and<br />&#9679; Use of Biometric data to support DBIS and electronic procedures post test data analysis
<p>R&amp;D Status:<br />NASA JSC possesses unique capabilities for prototyping, design, analysis, testing and integrating of DBIS technologies to support human spaceflight activities.</p>

<DESC><p><br />*** National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the University of Wisconsin System Space and Science Engineering Center (SSEC) for the yearly license of their sole proprietary property of the Man Computer Interactive Data Access Software (McIDAS).</p>
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS) Pacific Region's need for McIDAS' software license for a Base Year plus Four Option Year Periods.</p>
<p>The University of Wisconsin-Madison SSEC is the only provider of the McIDAS software used to capture satellite imagery. The renewal of the licenses must be completed by 1/1/2018 in order for the Pacific Region offices to be able to continue to use the satellite data. Without the data, the weather forecast offices will not be able to make the necessary forecast and warnings that could impact its mission of protecting life and property.</p>
<p>According to McIDAS' Software Distribution Policy:</p>
<p>"SSEC is the developer of McIDAS and is the sole distributor of the software. SSEC only gives McIDAS software support to those that have purchased a McIDAS Users' Group (MUG) membership, which includes the software license, online updates to the software and documentation, and user support. "</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">RFQ-SAB-18-00001<br /><br />Set Aside: N/A</p>
<p>NAICS: 519130 Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portal, Size Standards 1,000 Employees</p>
<p>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Research Triangle Park (RTP) in Durham, NC intends to award a firm fixed-price purchase order on a sole source basis to Illumina, Inc. in accordance with 13.106-1(b), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements for annual renewal of one year subscription to BaseSpace Correlation Engine.<br />EPA is using Simplified Acquisition Procedures for Commercial Services (FAR Parts 12 and 13).</p>
<p>EPA's National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL), Integrated System Toxicology Division (ISTD) is engaged in research projects utilizing the online web-based database which integrates the world's genomic information in ways that will enable researchers to develop biomedical insight, incorporating correlative, data-driven discovery that accelerates research by combining semantically structured data and simple user interfaces. This online web-based license will be used to derive, test and validate additional signatures that will be used in adverse outcome pathway prediction. The database is useful for all areas of molecular toxicology and will be open to EPA scientists using genomics to classify chemicals.</p>
<p>The online web-based database purchased must meet the government's following minimum requirements:<br /><br />Unique features to include the following:</p>
<p>1) Web-based interface that allows scientists with little or no experience in computational analysis to find experimental data and literature-driven correlations between genes, pathways, tissues, diseases, and compounds. Experimental signatures from these correlations can then be used to plan the next series of experiments.</p>
<p>2) View experimental results within the context of curated public data allowing correlations to be observed between your datasets and thousands of other experiments in the public domain.</p>
<p>3) Share discoveries between scientists, clinical researchers and bioinformaticians. Scientists and clinicians use the database's integrative biology platform to query and discuss experimental results.</p>
<p>4) Evaluate the efficiency of a treatment or practice. New data-driven hypotheses can be verified in-silico. Holistic view of both curated public and in-house generated data is leveraged to advance research. New findings are made and validated from previously conducted experiments.</p>
<p>Therefore, EPA believes Illumina, Inc. is the only vendor capable of providing the renewal software license needed for current research projects. This announcement constitutes the only synopsis for this requirement; and is for notification purposes only. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) WILL BE ISSUED. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the EPA's requirement as stated above may submit a capability statement, which if received within 10 days of the date of this announcement will be considered.</p>
<p>Responses to this posting must be in writing and provide a clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information concerning the project will be ignored. A determination by the EPA not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA.</p>
<p>All questions and comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Glennis Reslock, Contracting Officer, at reslock.glennis@epa.gov. No Telephone or Facsimiles inquiries will be accepted. If no affirmative responses are received by the deadline to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Illumnia, Inc.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL) intends to purchase a Velos Pro Dual Pressure Linear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer from Thermo Electron North America, LLC upon the basis of the authority provided at FAR 13.501(a)(1)(i).
<p>ERDC-CERL requires the purchase of a Velos Pro Dual Pressure Linear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (MS). The MS must be able to structurally determine and quantitate the chemicals and biomolecules at trace levels (femtomolar concentrations) in the liquid phase.</p>
<p>This requirement Includes:<br />&bull; LTQ04-10000 System, Velos Pro<br />&bull; OPTON-20042 Kit, Preinstallation, Velos Pro<br />&bull; OPTON-20037 HESI Probe, Mark 2, with 32G metal needle<br />&bull; ES071 Nanospray Flex Ion Source Kit<br />&bull; OPTON-20307, License, Trap-HCD for Velos Pro<br />&bull; Installation service on MS and all the related equipment <br />&bull; 4 day on-site training session</p>
<p>Equipment/installation/training is expected 60 days from date of award<br />The Velos Pro Dual Pressure Linear ion trap from Thermo Fisher is required because it is the only model of its kind that has the required MSn capabilities, scan speed, sensitivity, and resolution. It excels at the characterization of molecules from only minute sample quantities and is unrivaled for its ability to provide structural information from small amounts of sample that are inaccessible to other characterization methods. We note how important these specifications and capabilities are because this instrument will be critical for work in biomanufacturing and bioaugmentation, catalysis, water treatment, green chemistry, and environmental analysis. Thermo Fisher is the only known source that can fulfill all the requirements including delivery of the equipment as well as installation and training for the team of CERL scientists and engineers that will utilize it.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516, which has a size standard of 1,000 employees. This is not a small business set aside, as this Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. Any interested party that believes they can fulfill this requirement should submit a capability statement to be reviewed. All submissions will be considered, however there is no guarantee that submissions in response to this notice will in any way alter the Government's acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>CERL-CT-Quotes@usace.army.mil ATTN: David Ammermann</p>
<p>Telephone responses will not be accepted. Responses to this notice will not be considered as a response to any solicitation, a request to be added to a prospective offerors list, or to receive a copy of any solicitation. A determination by the Government not to compete the contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Warren (ACC-WRN) is preparing to award a sole source modification to Isometrics Inc., 1266 N. Scales St., Reidsville, North Carolina 27320, under existing contract W56HZV-13-D-0117, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (a)(2), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". Specifically, FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B) states, "Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements."<br /><br />The MFS TRM M108 is a non-commercial item specifically designed by Isometrics (TDP owner) for the U.S. Army. The Army is procuring a quantity of 142 M108 units in support of overseas contingency operations. As described in AR 73-1, re-procurements of a current specification from a previous source that have been out of production for a period of less than two years will not be required to perform a complete First Article Test (FAT). Isometrics is currently in production of the MFS TRM M108 and is scheduled to continue until March 2018. The MFS TRM M108 produced by Isometrics has passed specific Government testing encompassing reliability, durability, performance and operational test taking place over approximately a 12-month period.
<p>Technical data and/or drawings pertaining to Isometrics' TRM Model M108 are not available within the Government and are proprietary to Isometrics. It is the Government's belief that only Isometrics, the manufacturer of the parts, or its dealers and distributors can furnish the required parts with no unacceptable delays to the system fielding schedule. <br />All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency to meet the requirement for a quantity of 142 each Model M108 MFS TRM units including Basic Issue Items (BII), quantity 48 Authorized Stockage List (ASL), and quantity 48 Special Tools associated with each TRM. The Government will consider all responses received within 15 days of publication of this synopsis. Responses shall be submitted electronically to lori.e.finchem.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<CONTACT>Robert Burdette, Phone 3015948028, Email robert.burdette@nih.gov
<DESC>Within the Immediate Office of the Director, NIH Scientific Workforce Diversity (SWD), which is now 3 years old, is made up of a team of operations, programmatic, and communications staff members with expertise in biomedical, behavioral, and social science, as well as data analytics. Six are Ph.D. level, 4 are Masters level, and 2 are professionals with extensive government experience in communications and executive support. The office has evolved during the past 3 years and staff assignments and workloads have shifted in the context of increasing demands to achieve the SWD mission. The need for team building and management consultation has increased because of this evolution.
<p>The overarching responsibility for SWD is to ensure the effective coordination of diversity efforts across NIH extramural and intramural programs, using innovative and data-driven approaches that are designed to enhance diversity in the scientific workforce rapidly and sustainably. SWD is achieving its mission through the following strategic goals: 1) Expand scientific workforce diversity as a field of inquiry. 2) Build and implement evidence related to diversity outcomes. 3) Understand the role of sociocultural factors in biomedical recruitment and retention. 4) Sustain nationwide workforce diversity with seamless career transitions. 5) Promote the value of scientific workforce diversity.</p>
<p>The SWD staff collaborate internally and with an array of external partners across NIH, other federal agencies, and non-governmental entities to achieve the SWD mission. The team covers a broad mandate of responsibility that requires efficiency in performance and high communication skills to meet the demands of multiple projects and tasks. Projects may be conducted collaboratively with other NIH partners or may be conducted from within SWD depending on the depth, breadth, and focus. An example of internal collaboration occurs within the SWD communications team efforts which involve partnerships with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the NIH office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, trans-NIH committees, and the Department of Health and Human Services headquarters. In addition, the SWD serves in a leadership and coordinating role across NIH insofar as the COSWD serves as the chair or co-chair of key leadership committees, along with other NIH senior scientific leaders. <br />The SWD team, therefore is seeking an expert consultant to provide evidence-based teamwork, communications, and coaching to facilitate the overall performance of the unit. The consulting will include an assessment and intervention based on both confidential interviews and an evidence-based assessment, in person training sessions for half a day, a comprehensive report with recommendations for sustainability, executive coaching, and follow-up consultation with executive leadership. All training activities will take place at the NIH Bethesda campus.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to procure staff and executive level teambuilding and coaching consultant services, and expertise in the use of an evidence-based assessment tool to cultivate a cohesive teamwork ethic, improved communication, trust, and team performance. The team training services will be provided at the NIH in Bethesda, MD.</p>

<p><br />52.246-2 - Inspection of Supplies -- Fixed-Price (Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>

<p><br />CODE IDENTIFICATION AND PROJECT TITLE:<br />2017-21006A: Middle East Technical University (METU) Smart Campus Technical Assistance</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct technical assistance that will assist the Grantee in developing the necessary analysis and recommendations to determine how to best achieve integration of campus infrastructure and services that are to be collectively managed through the application of a centralized Information Communication Technology ("ICT") management and control system in support of a Smart Campus Project ("Project") in Turkey ("Host Country").</p>
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND AND GRANTEE:</p>
<p>The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) is providing a grant to the Middle East Technical University ("METU") for Technical Assistance ("TA") in support of a smart campus project.  The TA will explore the benefits of applying advanced technology solutions to enhance the areas of smart energy, smart transportation, smart water management, smart buildings and Information and Communication Technology ("ICT"), management and control systems.  In addition to developing detailed sector strategies in these key areas, the TA would provide technical, operational and financial guidance to serve as a roadmap for implementing the METU Smart Campus Project.  Ultimately, the goal of the smart campus project is to enable METU to determine how to best achieve integration of campus infrastructure and services through an integrated, centrally managed and operated project.  The project would include four sector components - smart energy, smart transportation, smart water management and smart buildings - as well as one overall ICT management and control component, which would be implemented in the near term (2 to 5 years).</p>
<p>The Grantee, the Middle East Technical University (METU), is a public technical university located in Ankara. The university has an emphasis on research and education in engineering and natural sciences, and offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral programs. The campus hosts METU Technopark, which is the largest technopark in Turkey with 320 R&amp;D companies and 5500 employees.</p>
<p>METU has demonstrated its commitment to a smart campus through a range of projects, including advanced wastewater, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and transportation projects. The administration is committed to planning and budgeting for an integrated smart campus project that will maximize efficiency and cost savings while providing for state of the art and sustainable solutions.</p>
<p>TA COMPONENTS:</p>
<p>The TA will include:  the development of a smart campus vision ("Vision") that captures key stakeholders' priorities for a smart and sustainable campus; the development of detailed sector strategies that assess the current state of each sector, identify information and technology gaps, identify opportunities for smart campus activities ("Activities"), and prioritize such Activities for the following sectors: Smart Energy, Smart Transportation, Smart Water, Smart Buildings, and ICT, Management, and Control System; the development of a METU Smart Campus Roadmap, which is a high level, long-term planning document for the Grantee to achieve the Vision; and the development of a plan for implementing the Activities as identified in the Near-Term Plan.  The Near-Term Plan will include detailed recommendations of U.S. technology solutions and applications for each Activity including a detailed design for the ICT infrastructure solution that addresses the integration of the other Activities in terms of shared infrastructure, services, resources and data.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $830,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><a href="http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form">http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form</a></span><br /><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5:00PM local (Ankara) time, December 11, 2017</span></strong> at the above address.  Electronic submissions with email subject line "METU Smart Campus Technical Assistance Proposal" should also be made via email to: Dr. Ozan Keysan, Assistant Professor (<span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><a href="mailto:keysan@metu.edu.tr">keysan@metu.edu.tr</a></span>).  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

COMBINED SYNOPSIS SOLICITATION


This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The government anticipates a single (all or none), firm fixed price award.  A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier s quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.


 36C10E18Q0003 the Combined Synopsis Solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).


The solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-95.


The combined synopsis/solicitation is set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concerns only.  Only quotes submitted by Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concerns will be accepted by the Government. Any quote that is submitted by a contractor that is not a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business will not be considered for award. Note that only VA verified SDVOSB in the VIP database at the quote due date and the time of contract award will be considered for award and non-VIP verified firms will be considered non-responsive and ineligible for award. The applicable NAICS Code for this solicitation is 332216 Handtools.  SDVOSB vendors that do not meet the NAICS 332216 Small Business Size limitation shall be considered non-responsive and ineligible for award.


The contractor shall provide all labor, parts, personnel, equipment, supplies, materials, travel, supervision and other related supplies and services to provide the required items.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Senior Transition Specialist position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations in the field to provide support and guidance for program implementation, staff training and mentoring, assessments, and the development and application of lessons learned. The Sr. Transition Specialist is supervised by an OTI Division Chief or his/her designee.</p>
<p>The incumbent for this position will be expected to initially work with the Program, Learning, and Innovation Division (PLI), which develops, oversees, and manages critical processes supporting the implementation of OTI country programs.  In carrying out these responsibilities, the PLI Division engages with local partners (both government and non-governmental) in the country of operation, counterparts in the U.S. Embassy, the USAID Missions, USAID and Department of State Regional Bureaus, the National Security Council, the Congress, and foreign and international donor organizations.  Given the operational contingent nature of OTI's work, the incumbent may be required to work with any OTI division or the Senior Leadership team for short or long periods of time.  The vast majority of the workload for this position will be in direct support of political transition program implementation.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Senior Transition Specialist requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Senior Transition Specialist is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the DCHA/OTI Chief of Program, Learning, and Innovation Division or his/her designee, the Senior Transition Specialist will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>Note: Duties and responsibilities are listed in order of importance for this position</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist with the development of information management products and improved business practices for OTI based on research and personal field experience lessons learned;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in Washington and the field as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Conduct, in collaboration with the relevant OTI regional team, assessments for possible new country programs, and visits to field sites in areas where OTI has projects;</p>
<p>&bull;	Execute, if required, closeout activities related to OTI programs, recommend strategic courses of action, facilitate closeout meetings, and provide ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, negotiate, within the guidelines provided by the OTI supervisor, or his/her designee, program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts;</p>
<p>&bull;	Conceptualize and design country program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy. When necessary, assist in refining strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in-country, possibly linked to neighboring country programs if considered appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent and articulate OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials;</p>
<p>&bull;	Identify or seek out NGOs, international donors, U.S. Government (USG) agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;</p>
<p>&bull;	Advise and/or assist in drafting documents outlining future planning and vision in the development and implementation of OTI programs, and assist in developing and improving country program monitoring and evaluation systems, providing guidance on designing and managing final evaluations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Advise Senior Management and Team Leaders on budget processes and reviews, preparing justification documentation when necessary;</p>
<p>&bull;	Update and revise, as needed, program management guides, including strategic planning and field operations materials;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as a liaison with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions and the State Department on program and policy direction;</p>
<p>&bull;	Help ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, supervise staff as delegated by the OTI supervisor (e.g.  Technical Advisors, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Admin Assistants, etc).  Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests;</p>
<p>&bull;	Fill critical program implementation staffing needs in Washington, D.C. and the field including the provision of ad hoc support to new OTI country program start-ups and on-call technical assistance, including providing supervisory support;</p>
<p>&bull;	As required, perform services under this scope of work at physical locations other than Washington OTI headquarters, including within other USAID offices, bureaus or other USG agencies;</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, act as Division Chief, or in other team roles;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide other services as required to fulfill OTI's program objectives as related to this scope of work.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />It is expected that the Senior Transition Specialist will take direction from and will initially report to OTI's Chief of Program, Learning, and Innovation Division or his/her designee.  This is a supervisory position, and the candidate may be required to supervise a range of staff for a portion or the duration of the contract.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will provide administrative directions in terms of broadly defined missions or functions. The employee will independently plan, design and carry out programs, projects, studies or other work assignments. The employee's work will be considered technically authoritative and normally accepted without significant change, and will be reviewed in terms of fulfillment of program objectives, influence on the overall program, or contribution to the advancement of the objective.</p>
<p>10.	PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>PHYSICAL DEMANDS:<br />The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. If traveling overseas, the employee may be subject to some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. An Offeror may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction.

There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR>In accordance with FAR 19.102(b), the small business size standard is applied by classifying the product or service being acquired in the industry whose definition, as found NAICS Manual, best describes the principal nature of the product or service being acquired. The NAICS code selected for this acquisition is (000000, DESCRIPTION) with an applicable small business size standard of ($Mil or # Employees).<BR><BR>The Contracting Officer (KO) at Mission and Installation Contracting Command, Joint Base Lewis-McChord is the only person authorized to approve changes or modify any of the requirements under this solicitation, and notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this solicitation, the said authority remains solely with the KO. In the event the Contractor or contractor employee effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the KO, the change will be considered to have been without authority, and no adjustment will be made in the price of any subsequently awarded contract under the Changes clause or any other clause to cover any increase in costs incurred as a result thereof.<BR><BR>If an interested party have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also officially protest to the contracting officer. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest.

If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.

Submission requirements: 
Provide up to a maximum of ten (10) projects with design/services completed within the past ten (10) years immediately preceding the date of issuance of this notice that best demonstrate specialized experience of the proposed team in the areas outlined above.
  Sufficient information to determine the date of completion of the project must be included in the project description or the project will not be considered.  If the project submitted was a design-bid-build (full design), then the design must be complete.  If the project was design-build, the design-build construction contract must be complete.  If more than the maximum number of projects is submitted, the Government will not evaluate projects beyond the maximum number specified in the submission requirements and projects will be evaluated in the order in which they are presented within the SF 330.  

All projects provided in the SF 330 must be completed by the office/branch/regional office/individual team member actually proposed to manage and perform work under this contract.
  Projects not meeting this requirement will be excluded from consideration in the evaluation.  To enable verification, firms should include the DUNS number along with each firm name in the SF 330 Part I, Section F, block 25, Firm Name Include a contract number or project identification number in block 21.  Include an e-mail address and phone number for the point of contact in block 23(c).  In block 24, include in the project description the contract period of performance, award contract value, current contract value, and a summary of the work performed that demonstrates relevance to specialized experience as outlined above.  If the contractor served as a subcontractor on a project, indicate the value of the work that firm provided towards the performance of the overall project.
  If a project was performed by a joint venture, and not all joint venture partners are on the team proposed for this contract, the firm/team should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner offering/teaming on this contract.  Likewise, if the firm/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the firm/team member proposed for this contract and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole.  If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.


NOTE: If the firm is a joint venture, projects performed by the joint venture should be submitted; however, if there are no projects performed by the joint venture, projects must be submitted for each joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of eight projects.
  Firms failing to provide projects from all joint venture partners will be considered to have not met the requirements of the criterion. 

Projects shall be submitted on the SF 330 at Part I, Section F and shall be completed projects.  Projects not completed will be excluded from evaluation consideration.  For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award.  Do not submit an IDIQ contract as an example project.  Instead, list relevant task orders or stand-alone contract awards that fit within the definition above.  The Government will not evaluate information provided for an IDIQ contract.  Examples of project work submitted that do not conform to this requirement will not be evaluated.
  Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers may result in a firm being considered less qualified.

All information for Criterion 1 should be submitted in the SF 330, Part I, Section F.  The Government WILL NOT consider information submitted in addition to Part I, Section F in evaluation of Criterion 1.

Criterion 2Professional Qualifications and Technical Competence (SF330, Part I, Sections E  and  G):
Firms will be evaluated on professional qualifications, competence, and experience of the proposed key personnel in providing services to accomplish the tasks required under this contract, including participation in example projects in the SF330, Part I, Section G.
  Key personnel are individuals who will have major contract or project management responsibilities and/or will provide unusual or unique expertise.  Failure to provide a balanced workforce in the disciplines required to satisfy the requirements of the scope listed above will result in the firm being considered not qualified. Specific disciplines that must be included in key personnel are quality control, task order managers, project managers, and architects.   Key personnel, including sub-consultants, must be U. S. citizens and able to obtain security clearances as required.
Firms may be considered more favorably by including professional qualifications, competence, and experience, including participation in example projects, for the following disciplines: civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, fire protection, geotechnical, cost engineering, lighting design, landscape architecture, and interior design.

Submission Requirements:
SF 330, Part I, Section E - Provide resumes for all proposed key personnel that illustrate experience in the work proposed under this contract.

<DESC><strong>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</strong><br />Imaging Equipment Recompete<br />Solicitation - 2018-R-006<br />October 5, 2017<br />
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Will you consider making this a small business set a side?<br /><strong>Answer 1</strong>:	No, the Senate does not have set aside or preference requirements for its contracts.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Does the Senate have a small business preference?<br /><strong>Answer 2:</strong> See Question 1 above.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Is the contract open to multiple awards to small business?<br /><strong>Answer 3:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> Does the Senate have any preference for products on the GSA schedule?<br /><strong>Answer 4:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> In the same offer can you propose GSA models and open market models?<br /><strong>Answer 5:</strong> Yes, both GSA and open market models may be proposed in the same offer.</p>
<p><strong>Question 6:</strong> Will the Senate accept proposals for Copiers only?<br /><strong>Answer 6:</strong> No, the proposal must include copiers and fax machines.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C.2.2. Facsimile Machines</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 7:</strong> Does the Fax machine need to be TAA compliant?<br /><strong>Answer 7:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Question 8:</strong> (C.2.2.2) Since most fax machines are considered customer installable, would you consider making installation of a fax machine a separate CLIN? This would save the Federal Government money. <br /><strong>Answer 8:</strong> No, fax machine installation must be included in the pricing of the fax machine.</p>
<p><strong>Question 9: </strong>(C.2.2.5) For maintenance of the fax machine, would a "quick exchange" be acceptable? In other words, if the fax is broken, instead of a service tech visit, a new/like device would be shipped within the next 48 hours. The broken device will be put back in the new device box with a paid shipping label.<br /><strong>Answer 9:</strong> No, a "quick exchange" is not acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Question 10:</strong> (C.2.2.6) What desktop fax application is the Senate currently using?  Is a Fax Server a requirement? If so would the government add a CLIN to support this requirement?<br /><strong>Answer 10:</strong> The desktop faxing application was only to inform bidders of the likely decline in demand for fax machines over the length of the awarded contract. No further information will be provided to bidders.</p>
<p><strong>Question 11:</strong> Will the Senate consider a low-end A4-type Multi-Function Device (MFD) with FAX capability as a fax unit since the Senate's technology transition to alternative faxing solutions would allow the device to be placed elsewhere should a nearby MFD be incorporated into the network FAX solution?<br /><strong>Answer 11:</strong> Yes, the Senate will consider a low-end A4 MFD with fax capability as a fax unit, provided that meter reads are not required and do not factor into the maintenance pricing.</p>
<p><strong>Question 12:</strong> Please explain the request for single function fax machines when fax capability is requested as an option on the multi-functional devices.  Adding this accessory to the MFDs is significantly less expensive than purchasing separate fax machines, especially for the ongoing support and supplies that are already accounted for in the MFD maintenance plans.	<br /><strong>Answer 12:</strong> We have a demand for both single function fax machines and MFDs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>C.2.3 Copiers</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Question 13:</strong> Does the Senate have any plans to lease copiers using the GSA schedule terms and conditions? <br /><strong>Answer 13:</strong> No, the Senate does not have any plans to lease copiers as part of this contract.</p>
<p><strong>Question 14:</strong> Can you clarify any paper size requirements on the copiers?<br /><strong>Answer 14:</strong> All copiers must copy and print to 11 x 8.5 and 11 x 14.  Class II and III copiers must also print and copy to 11 x 17 inch paper.</p>
<p><strong>Question 15:</strong> (C.2.3.2) Does the Senate require this class to Print and Copy on 11 x 17 inch paper?	<br /><strong>Answer 15:</strong> Yes, the requirement is to print and copy on 11 x 17 inch  paper.</p>
<p><strong>Question 16:</strong> (C.2.3.3) Does the Senate require this class to Print and Copy on 11 x 17 inch paper?<br /><strong>Answer 16:</strong> Yes, the requirement is to print and copy on 11 x 17 inch  paper.<br /> <br /><strong>Question 17:</strong> (C.2.3.3) Will the Senate please narrow the speed range for this class, as a 20 page per minute range can significantly affect pricing?<br /><strong>Answer 17:</strong> A class III copier ranges from 45ppm to 65ppm.  Bidders may offer any machine in this range.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>C.2.4 Invoicing</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Question 18:</strong> (C.2.4.6  &amp; C.2.4.7) Please explain the difference between the State maintenance contract and the DC maintenance contract? <br /><strong>Answer 18:</strong> Equipment located in DC falls under the DC maintenance contract; equipment located in state offices falls under the state maintenance contract.  There are separate requirements for each, per section C.2.5.</p>
<strong>Question 19:</strong> When you say the field units will be charged to the state, do you mean by machine, by location or a pooled amount for all the units in the state? <br />
<p><strong>Answer 19:</strong> There is no reference to field units in this solicitation.  Please provide more detail and site the section of the solicitation that requires more clarification.</p>
<p><strong>Question 20:</strong> (C.2.4.6) Does the winning vendor(s) need to be on the PMI's state contract?<br /><strong>Answer 20:</strong> The Senate does not understand this question.  PMI refers to preventative maintenance inspection, which could occur if the Senate requested to add a machine to the maintenance contract that had been previously dropped from the maintenance contract.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>C.2.5 Maintenance</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Question 21: </strong> Please confirm you are looking for a cost per print (pages billed) maintenance contract that includes supplies and service versus a buy toner as you need it with a separate maintenance contract. In other words are you looking to buy supplies separately? <br /><strong>Answer 21:</strong> Supplies, such as toner, should be billed separately and should not be included as part of the maintenance contract.</p>
<p><strong>Question 22:</strong> Please confirm the Senate will accept standard maintenance programs with allowances/base charges/overages, and/or pooled maintenance volume billings for concentrated quantities (i.e. DC area). <br /><strong>Answer 22:</strong> Yes, the Senate will accept maintenance programs with allowances/base charges, overages, and/or pooled maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Question 23:</strong> (C.2.5.7) Can you define "Fleet Maintenance Program" as it pertains to this RFP?  <br /><strong>Answer 23:</strong> A fleet maintenance program means pooled maintenance with an allowance and a fixed price per quarter, with additional charges incurred only upon exceeding the pooled allowance.</p>
<p><strong>Question 24:</strong> (C.2.5.8) Will the Senate add a CLIN for Vendor to provide a cost for a dedicated on-site technician?<br /><strong>Answer 24:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Question 25:</strong> (C.2.6.4 - Reports) As it relates to maintenance pricing, can you explain what pricing you are looking for when you say "Contractor shall provide a list of consumable supplies and pricing for all the models in use in the Senate......." If this is a cost per page contract, can you explain what exactly you are looking for in this report? <br /><strong>Answer 25:</strong> This is not a cost per page contract.  Offices must buy toner separately.  However, we require vendors to provide what consumable supplies are used in each of the models under contract and the pricing so that offices have this information when consumable supplies must be purchased.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>C.2.8 Optional 24x7 Maintenance Support </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Question 26:</strong> What are the anticipated number of machines requiring 24/7 maintenance and what criteria qualifies a machine for this type of service? <br /><strong>Answer 26:</strong> 11 machines currently require 24x7 maintenance support.  This type of service would be restricted to Class III or higher volume machines and as determined by the ordering office.</p>
<p><strong>Question 27:</strong> Where are the systems located? How many are located in each location? <br /><strong>Answer 27:</strong> Optional 24x7 maintenance support would apply only to copiers located in DC.</p>
<p><strong>Question 28:</strong> Does the Senate expect the number of systems requiring 24x7 maintenance support to expand?<br /><strong>Answer 28:</strong> Expansion is possible if the need arise.</p>
<p><strong>Question 29:</strong> Will the devices that need 24 x 7 service require the 24 x7 service on a continuous basis or will the needed time frame for 24x 7 service be communicated in advance for the identified copier? <br /><strong>Answer 29:</strong> This is on a continuous basis.</p>
<p><strong>Question 30:</strong> Will the Senate accept an off-site Authorized Servicing Dealer to provide the service for the machines requiring 24/7 service (separate from the company that provides the on-site service during the Senate's normal business hours) with the understanding that the technician for 24/7 maintenance will not reside on-site?<br /><strong>Answer 30:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Question 31:</strong> On the price page for Optional 24/7 Maintenance Support, is the Senate looking for B&amp;W and Color pricing for the Class III and also for the High Volume Copier (75-100 ppm)? <br /><strong>Answer 31:</strong> Bidders may provide pricing per model or pooled.  If pricing differs for B&amp;W and color models, bidders may offer different pricing for B&amp;W vs color machines.  <br /> <br /><strong>Question 32:</strong> We don't see a place to insert any purchase pricing for the 75-100 page per minute machine, only 24/7 maintenance pricing.  Is that what the Senate intended?<br /><strong>Answer 32:</strong> The Senate did not include a requirement to supply pricing for copiers in the 75-100ppm class because machines of this volume are not part of our standard offering.  However, some legacy machines in use require after-hours support.<br /> <br /><strong>Question 33:</strong> (C.2.8.2) The GSA contract has an 8- hour response time in which the government often asks for an average 4- hour response time.  Will the Senate accept a 4- hour response time?<br /><strong>Answer 33:</strong> No.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>H.14 Intellectual Property Rights</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Question 34:</strong> (H.14) Please clarify what the Senate means by the Vendor has to transfer "rights." Does this mean rights to USE, and not all "right, title and interest?<strong><br />Answer 34:</strong> This provision applies to contractors developing software or other intellectual property for the Senate, and does not apply to this contract.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I.9 Standards of Conduct and Restrictions</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Question 35:</strong> (I.9.1) Please clarify that this applies to technical employees only, the people actually doing break fix, etc.<br /><strong>Answer 35: </strong>This provision applies to all Contractor personnel doing business with the Senate under this contract.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>L.7. Proposal Instructions</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Question 36:</strong> What information is required for the authorized service providers in DC and at the state level?<br /><strong>Answer 36:</strong> Bidders shall provide a list of authorized dealers by location who will be able to support the Senate state office locations listed in Attachment J-01.</p>
<p><strong>Question 37:</strong> Can you define which team members you require a resume for? What information is required on a resume? Can the resumes be provided after award?<br /><strong>Answer 37:</strong> Resumes are required for the Contract Program Manager and the alternate POC for the Contract Program Manager.  Resumes shall include work history, along with dates of employment and any specialized training or certifications that demonstrate qualifications.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2018-R-006 Attachment:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Question 38:</strong> In the Attachment J-04 Equipment Pricing Tables, Optional 24 X7 Optional Maintenance Support the Senate asks for 75-100 Page per minute device, please provide the requirements for the devices in this speed range?  <br /><strong>Answer 38:</strong> Requirements have not been defined for this equipment since higher volume equipment is not a standard offering to Senate offices.</p>

<SUBJECT>Brazil - Safety Assessment and Improvement Strategy for Congonhas Airport Technical Assistance

<CONTACT>Jennifer Van Renterghem, Lead Project Information Specialist, Phone (703) 875-4357, Fax (703) 875-4009, Email RFPQuestions@ustda.gov
<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Modification #2:<br /></span></strong>Please note the following questions have been answered and supporting document attached:<br /><br />Q. Please clarify if performance of the Safety Assessment Technical Assistance for the Grantee ("Secret&aacute;ria de Aviac&atilde;o Civil" or "SAC), would preclude the consultant from working as advisors or engineers to either the Government/parastatal agencies carrying out future concession related transactions, or to the private investor groups seeking to enter into concessions for the same? We note from recent news articles, that Congonhas Airport will be included among assets to be concessioned in 2018.
<p><br />A.	As per SAC, companies that participate in this Technical Assistance will not be precluded from any work related to an eventual future concession of Congonhas Airport.  The Brazilian Government considers this Technical Assistance as an independent project.</p>
<p>Q. Task 3: Definition of Investment Strategies requires the evaluation of demand scenarios that account for traffic mix and other factors in the near- and long-term. We recognize the information that will be provided to the Offeror by Infraero in Table 2(c)(i) encompasses relevant material.  However, we request an elaboration from USTDA as to the expected extent of traffic and demand forecasts required at CGH for the purposes of the demand scenarios. We also ask that if any such studies have been recently completed that these are provided at project commencement, as well as a description of how extensive these forecasts are so we may account for the work to be completed in our work plan and budgetary allocations.<br /><br />A. The traffic demand scenario analysis should recognize that Congonhas Airport operates under a slot limitation that limits commercial operations.   Any increase in commercial operations and passengers will need to be based on realistic ways to accommodate such increases in the available space at the airport site while minimizing risks and maintaining an adequate level of safety.  Accordingly, the traffic demand scenarios should follow from the safety risk assessment in Task 2, particularly the maximum number of operations and hourly slots to be allowed in the future and how traffic increases will be phased in light of recommended improved technologies, operational procedures, and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Traffic demand forecasts were done by Infraero and will be part of the material to be provided to the winning Offeror.  An excerpt of their data is attached.  However, it will be necessary to validate these existing demand forecasts, as well as to complement them with the future scenario (according to the Airport Master Plan) and the infrastructure restrictions.</p>

<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) TITLE: Global Operational Tactical Information Technology (GOT-IT)</p>
<p>BAA ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>BAA NUMBER: BAA AFRL-RIK-2015-0024</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) NUMBER: 12.800</p>
<p><strong>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RI), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to enable the effective management of information for military operations.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Problem</span>: Warfighters need immediate access to information that is critical to their mission regardless of their location or what they have available to them in terms of communications, data storage and processing power. Unfortunately, the availability of these computational resources is inversely proportional to the warfighter's proximity to the tactical edge where access to information that is critical to the success of their mission is limited by the connectivity, bandwidth and computing constraints of tactical communications and information systems. Compounding these limitations is the fact that close proximity to the tactical edge typically accompanies a more contested and higher threat environment. These circumstances make the availability of essential information even more important, not only for mission assurance, but for the survival of those that are in harm's way at the tactical edge. At the other end of the spectrum in the enterprise environment, these same limitations also impede the ability of commanders to reach forward to the tactical Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) required for rapid and informed Command and Control (C2) decisions that directly impact mission assurance. The disparity that currently exists between enterprise and tactical network infrastructures must be bridged to enable effective information exchange for shared situational awareness across all echelons of command.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span>: AFRL has developed Information Management (IM) services that have been designed to facilitate the exchange of information between disparate user applications and data sources. These IM services have primarily been developed following a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) client-server computing model and are designed to operate across clusters of computers for the purposes of scalability, performance and resiliency in enterprise environments. AFRL has also developed a number of moving map Situational Awareness (SA) applications that run on mobile devices (Android tablets and smart phones) designed primarily for use by at the tactical edge. For information exchange, these SA applications utilize server-based IM services hosted at a centralized location, e.g., on an airborne platform or in a Tactical Operations Center (TOC). Tablet based collaborative applications operating over Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) can benefit at times from a client-based model of computing where mobile operations in austere environments can remove users from reach of the server running IM services. Recently, AFRL has developed a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) publish/subscribe/query Cursor on Target (CoT) messaging system for Android and Java platforms. These client-based IM services operate without reliance on a centralized server.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus</span>: The objective of this BAA is to develop and demonstrate middleware to bridge the tactical and enterprise domains, realizing decentralized IM services built upon client-based protocols for use at the tactical edge that can coexist and interoperate securely with the server-based IM services that are well-suited for deployment in enterprise-scale environments. To improve the exchange of information between enterprise and the tactical edge networks and applications, these services need to be capable of operating in contested/congested environments and be built upon disruption and fault tolerant techniques and technologies.</p>
<p>The research and development to be conducted under this BAA is focused on the following:</p>
<p>1) Interoperable hybrid centralized &amp; decentralized IM services designed for mobile operations.<br />2) Gateways for the exchange of heterogeneous information across disparate networks.<br />3) Disruption tolerant information preservation, optimized delivery, and synchronization. <br />4) Demonstration of the utility of these capabilities in operationally relevant environments.</p>
<p>A hybrid interoperable mix of decentralized P2P and centralized client-server IM services, gateways that facilitate the translation of incompatible data formats and protocols to enable interoperability across disparate networks, and information dissemination capabilities that are tolerant to disruptions in connectivity and infrastructure service failures are the primary focus areas of this BAA. Federation services will be necessary to exchange information across the boundaries of information spaces whether they are located within the networks of Continental United States (CONUS), overseas, or forward-deployed military forces.</p>
<p>Current and emerging tactical datalink systems on Joint and Air Force airborne and surface assets are incompatible and non-interoperable, encompassing a broad range of disparate information exchange standards and protocols. Enterprise data encompasses a plethora of different data formats, messaging protocols, and even waveforms that tactical applications may not be designed to interact with. While the ideal long term solution to interoperability is to upgrade old systems and enforce acquisitions compliance for new systems to a Joint Technical Architecture (JTA), the only realistic and affordable approach in the foreseeable future is the continued use of gateway solutions. GOT-IT seeks to provide an open architecture that will facilitate the rapid development and deployment of gateway middleware services that translate various types of enterprise data into a form that is consumable by tactical end user applications, including map and geo-positioning information. Building upon existing IM capabilities, an extensible open systems plug-and-play framework for deploying a diverse range of map, imagery, video, voice, data, and distributed processing gateway services is to be developed.</p>
<p>In some aspects, GOT-IT will act as an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) built for information exchange to and from the tactical edge. Many tactical applications employ CoT as the standard format for SA information exchange. The CoT data strategy centers on the use of a "common language" for tactical systems that is critical in communicating much needed time sensitive position information, or the "What, When, and Where" of specific events as they occur. As such, GOT-IT will need to address the mediation challenges associated with delivering (likely in the form of CoT) warfighter relevant information extracted from a diverse set of heterogeneous enterprise-level data sources, formats and message protocols such as GML, KML, GIS, UCORE, NIEM, CMD, USMTF, etc.</p>
<p>GOT-IT capabilities need to incorporate end-to-end security mechanisms sufficient for assured information exchange across distributed tactical and enterprise information spaces. GOT-IT may need to augment CoT messaging with "Who and Why" metadata to facilitate a broader range of functionality, such as cross-domain information exchange, pedigree and trust management, context-driven selective message routing, identity management, and Role/Attribute Based Access Control (RBAC/ABAC). Well established Authentication &amp; Authorization (A&amp;A) mechanisms can be exploited, such as X.509 certificate-based security standards (for example, Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS)) and encryption and advanced key management security techniques (including NSA Type I products and Suite B cryptography algorithms).</p>
<p>The design space for GOT-IT capabilities will be constrained by the very nature of tactical data link communications where mobility, high latency, low bandwidth and intermittent connectivity are common place, and will also need to take into account the future as cellular network capabilities begin to emerge at the tactical edge. In such congested and contested tactical environments, disruption tolerant information preservation and delivery (message-level store-and-forward), optimized Quality of Service (QoS) based on mission needs and constraints (prepositioning of information, filtering, prioritized delivery), and information resynchronization (eventual consistency) will be important elements of GOT-IT developed capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>a) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- The soundness of approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and the methodology for measuring and demonstrating success, <br />b) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror can substantiate expertise in relevant technologies and knowledge of military application domains, <br />c) Openness, Maturity and Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and open systems standards are proposed to be used and the relative maturity of them, and <br />d) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>
<p>Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) PUBLIC ACCESS: The Government is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the FAPIIS before making any award in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000) over the period of performance. An applicant may review and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered. The Government will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR &sect; 200.205 Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants and per FAR 9.104-6 FAPIIS.</p>
<p><strong>VI. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP TWO</span> INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</strong></p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>For additional information, a copy of the AFRL "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): Guide for Industry," Mar 2015, and Proposal Preparation Instructions, Dec 2014, may be accessed at: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">Https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=<br />core&amp;_cview=1</a><br /><br />2.

<p>Army Contracting Command-Rock Island (ACC-RI) is seeking industry comment and feedback on this DRFP's content prior to release of a final RFP. The DRFP is being issued for the sole purpose of receiving questions/comments from potential offerors regarding the requirement for the development and deployment of the Power Control and Management Subsystem (PCMS). The draft language contained herein is a representative of what may be in the final RFP.</p>
<p>1. Army Contracting Command-Rock Island (ACC-RI), Rock Island, IL, has a non-commercial requirement to support the Wideband Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Operations Management System (WSOMS) with the development and deployment of the Power Control and Management Subsystem (PCMS) for Project Manager, Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS), Product Manager, Wideband Enterprise Satellite Systems (PM WESS).</p>
<p>This procurement is for the PCMS, which will be used over military Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites, and potentially used over leased transponders of commercial wideband satellites in C, Ku, and Ka bands. The PCMS will enable more efficient use of communications resources, and aid in link anomaly detection and resolution. The major goals of the PCMS are to provide link power control and power and bandwidth monitoring for all communications links of enterprise and tactical terminal Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) communications networks. This will include out-of-beam spectrum collection and processing to support Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) detection, and providing a text orderwire to tactical terminals (positive control). A Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the PCMS has been prepared by the Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC/ARSTRAT) and is provided as part of this RFI to provide additional information on PCMS architecture, requirements, and operations.</p>
<p>2. This requirement will be competed as a full and open competition and any qualified vendor, regardless of size status, may submit a proposal.

Each subsequent delivery order will be accompanied by a CRS that will align with the Base Contract CRS attached herein.</p>
<p>4. A formal source selection process will be utilized and a Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) will be convened.

<p><br />FOREWORD</p>
<p>Work is located at the Third Powerplant of Grand Coulee Dam near the Town of Coulee Dam, Washington in Okanogan County. This announcement is a follow up event to the previous Industry Day Announcement made on October 3, 2017. The Government would like to include the opportunity for Industry one-on-one meetings regarding the upcoming project to refurbish the hydrogenating units G19, G20, and G21 located in the Third Powerplant of Grand Coulee Dam.</p>
<p><br />INDUSTRY DAY</p>
<p>The currently scheduled Industry Day will take place on Wednesday, November 8th, 2017 at approximately 9:00 a.m. (local/P.S.T.) a project briefing and safety Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) meeting will take place at the Administrative Offices (Large Conference Room) located in Grand Coulee, WA. Following the briefing an escorted partial walk through of Unit G19 will be conducted at approximately 1:00pm until 4:00 pm (local time).</p>
<p>During this event, the Government would like to extend the opportunity to discuss the approach and possible concerns from Industry regarding the project either Wednesday, November 8th 2017 or Thursday, November 9th 2017. The meetings will be held individually, on a one-on-one basis, with Industry partners. The meetings will be scheduled for approximately 30 minutes and time slots will be assigned based on Industry interest. The one-on-one meetings will take place at the Grand Coulee Administrative Offices in the Small Conference Room.</p>
<p>The Government considers this a fact finding effort in partnership with Industry and will publish any questions answered with responses publicly. To make the event as productive as possible, the Government would encourage industry to submit questions, prior to October 24th, 2017, to Brian Clark by email at bdclark@usbr.gov. The Government will address as many of these questions as possible, prior to, or on the Industry day publicly. Any specific questions about the project during the one-on-one meetings will be recorded and answered publicly. This opportunity is intended to be project specific rather than a capabilities presentation of those involved.</p>
<p>Contractors should make arrangements by contacting Brian Clark by email to bdclark@usbr.gov by October 24th, 2017 to guarantee a time slot for discussion of the project.

The Page 3: Architectures thrust of the Electronics Resurgence Initiative (ERI) seeks to demonstrate heterogeneous computing systems that provide the performance advantages of specialized processors, while maintaining the programmability of general purpose processors.<br/><br/>The goal of the Software Defined Hardware (SDH) program is to build runtime-reconfigurable hardware and software that enables near ASIC performance without sacrificing programmability for data-intensive algorithms. SDH will create a hardware/software system that allows data-intensive algorithms to run at near ASIC efficiency without the cost, development time or single application limitations associated with ASIC development. <br/><br/>The overall goal of the Domain-specific System on Chip (DSSoC) program is to develop a heterogeneous SoC comprised of many cores that mix general-purpose processors, special-purpose processors, hardware accelerators, memory, and input/output (I/O). DSSoC seeks to enable rapid development of multi-application systems through a single programmable device.<br/>

<DESC>This update, dated September 14, 2017, makes the following provisions: 

    (1)  Adjusts the Solicitation N61340-17-R-0905 (the RFP) draft published under the update made on September 7, 2017 (Update 9-7-17) by--

        (a)  replacing the previously provided versions of Section J Attachment 1 and 8 and 

        (b)  adding Section L attachments.

    (2)  Gives additional information about the pre-solicitation conference announced under Update 9-7-17 (the Conference).

A core goal of the Conference is to ensure potential offerors understand selected topics regarding the RFP. The Government aims to achieve this outcome by telephone. This environment is suitable for this method of communication planned for use during the Conference.

This method will include a one-way presentation.
 During this presentation, the Government will cover various topics, as discussed in the preceding paragraph. This timeframe offers an opportunity for the Conference attendees to glean important details concerning the RFP.

The Government plans to employ two-way communications during the Conference after giving the presentation. If practicable, the Government may invite the interested parties in attendance to give feedback (i.e., questions or comments) on the RFP. All feedback shall be submitted in writing to the POC listed below. 

An interested party that attends the Conference may use its Participant ID Number (PIN) to ask questions during the Conference itself. Each interested party that registers for the Conference will receive a PIN for this purpose in advance.
 Each company is limited to three (3) call-in lines. When dialing in, each attendee shall announce their presence using the provided PIN.  

The preceding information describes the entirety of this update. If any questions or comments arise as a result of this update, please contact Mr. LaVenji Daniels by e-mail at lavenji.daniels@navy.mil.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>Maritime Non-Containerized Cargo: <br />Radiation Detection Equipment and Operations</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP or Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). This RFI does not commit the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) to contract for any supply or service. DHS DNDO is not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the DNDO will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or BAA. If a solicitation is released, it will be released via the Government-Wide Port of Entry (GPE) at (http://www.fedbizopps.gov). It is the responsibility of the potential responders to monitor the website for any information that may pertain to this RFI. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the DNDO, and will not be returned.</p>
<p>1.0 Description</p>
<p>Nuclear terrorism is a persistent threat that has potentially devastating consequences, and countering that threat is the reason the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) was created. DNDO's mission is to detect and protect against the unauthorized importation, possession, storage, transportation, development, or use of a nuclear explosive device, fissile material, or radiological material in the United States, and to protect against attack using such devices or materials against the people, territory, or interests of the United States. DNDO's research and development does not focus just on current threats and capabilities, but continually seeks to anticipate future trends and challenges. Furthermore, DNDO does not restrict itself to domestic security within the U.S., but reaches out to U.S. foreign partners to aid in effectively organizing, training, and equipping foreign security personnel to prevent nuclear terrorism globally. To this end, DNDO continually acquires radiation detection equipment for deployment and operation by DHS and state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement entities to protect pathways of global commerce.</p>
<p>Through this RFI, DNDO is conducting market research to identify current industry capabilities to detect, identify, and/or localize radiological/nuclear threats (including material and other components) that may be smuggled via maritime non-containerized cargo (MNCC) at seaports. These capabilities are to be on a mobile or relocatable platform, occur in real-time, and include the ability to provide a still-image (photo) of the scene during a detection event. This RFI could potentially lead to a material solution acquisition/Request for Proposal in approximately 18-24 months.</p>
<p>The information provided in response to this RFI may be used to assess market capabilities; discover alternate or improved technologies or concepts; determine the technical maturity and commercial availability of potential solutions; and support future planning efforts to strengthen the vast Global Nuclear Detection Architecture with next-generation radiation detection and identification technologies.</p>
<p>2.0 Information Sought</p>
<p>DNDO is seeking technological solutions for scanning maritime non-containerized cargo (MNCC) entering the US through sea ports of entry (POEs) for radioactive materials.</p>
<p>There are three types of MNCC: bulk, break-bulk, and roll-on/roll-off.</p>
<p>Bulk cargo is cargo that is transported unpackaged in large quantities. It may be comprised of dry commodities (e.g., grain, seed, gravel, powder, coal, and ore) and/or liquid commodities (e.g., petroleum products, chemicals) and is usually dropped or poured as liquid or solid into a bulk carrier's hold.</p>
<p>Break-bulk cargo is loose cargo, shipped in bags, bundles, crated, or on strongbacks that are stowed in the ship's hold (as opposed to containerized cargo or bulk cargo). Break-bulk includes commodities such as large steel products, machinery, crated goods, wood, and agricultural products and cargo in non-International Standards Organization (non-ISO) compliant containers.</p>
<p>Roll-on/roll-off cargo is comprised of cars and other wheeled cargos, such as tractors, loaded trailers, and other heavy machinery that may be loaded and unloaded using ramps.</p>
<p>DNDO is seeking equipment that can detect, identify, and/or localize illicit radiological/nuclear material in the MNCC environment. Solutions shall detect, identify, and/or localize radiological/nuclear material in real-time from a mobile platform, relocatable platform, or some combination of the two. Equipment shall provide the end-user with actionable information in real-time to assist with the adjudication of radiological/ nuclear anomalies in the MNCC environment.</p>
<p>Due to differences among the various MNCC seaport POEs, a single solution may not be applicable for all locations; multiple solutions may be necessary to accommodate all seaport POEs. System designs are unconstrained (i.e., Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), developmental, and non-developmental solutions). Since DHS/DNDO will not provide any helium-3 based on the policy statement released in May 2014 (i.e., https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DHS/OCPO/DHS-OCPO/DNDOHe3/listing.html), it is required that responders not offer a solution using helium-3 based neutron detectors unless the helium-3 is coming from the vendor's supply.</p>
<p>3.0 Performance Characteristics</p>
<p>Requirements for radiation detection systems, as well as additional requirements for relocatable radiation detection and mobile systems, are provided below.</p>
<p>Requirements Applicable to all Radiation Detection Systems *</p>
<p>&bull; Detect and/or identify radiological/nuclear material in the MNCC pathway.<br />&bull; Capable of discriminating Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (NORM) from non-NORM sources.<br />&bull; Wireless annunciator for alarm types; operate up to 50 feet away.<br />&bull; Control software to monitor multiple units in the same area. Please clarify if the system uses cable or wireless protocols. <br />&bull; Operate in -30&deg;C to +55&deg;C (-22&deg;F to 131&deg;F).<br />&bull; Require minimal start up time when starting up within the operating temperatures [preferably no more than five (5) minutes]. <br />&bull; Self-calibrating on a continual basis.<br />&bull; Wirelessly report state of health to a centralized network.<br />&bull; Wirelessly send daily scan statistics through a centralized network for archiving purposes.<br />&bull; NIEM N.25 compliant.<br />&bull; ANSI N42.42 compliant.<br />&bull; Does not require a Commercial Driver's License.</p>
<p>*Automated systems during offload may also be considered.</p>
<p>Additional Requirements for Relocatable Radiation Detection System</p>
<p>&bull; Require minimal set up time at a new location. <br />&bull; Minimize background corruption from radiation sources (NORM or otherwise) moving into the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Additional Requirements for Radiation Detection/Identification (or Categorization) Mobile Systems</p>
<p>&bull; Operate in a stationary or mobile scanning mode.<br />&bull; Able to be stored in a temperature range of -30&deg;C to +80&deg;C (-22&deg;F to 176&deg;F).<br />&bull; At a minimum, use one-sided detection (driver's side strongly preferred). If options or variants for multi-sided detection, please specify.<br />&bull; Plug into a standard 110V/220V (110/120VAC 60 Hz. NEMA 5-15P Receptacle preferred) outlet to power on board computer, radiation detector system, hand-held inspection equipment chargers, and any peripheral equipment (in stationary mode).<br />&bull; Track, via GPS, the path and alerts (mobile mode).<br />&bull; For systems utilizing one-sided vertical detection, able to link two units together as a two-sided drive-thru portal (in stationary mode), i.e. data from both sides wirelessly linked together to determine alarm status.<br />&bull; Driver's side high-definition quality, pan-tilt-zoom camera to capture vehicle images for alerts.<br />&bull; For stationary mode, have an optimal light rig for night/low light operations. <br />&bull; Operate off its own vehicle power in mobile scanning mode or a separate power source (e.g. shore power or onboard generator) in stationary mode.</p>

<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SSC Pacific) intends to issue solicitation No. N66001-17-R-0191 for OCONUS Navy Enterprise Network (ONE-NET) Technology Procurement Support for IT Hardware which involves approximately 29 commercial hardware item CLINS (as reflected in the attached Draft Statement of Work). The purpose of this procurement for PC Refresh involves the development, testing, accreditation, integration, and purchase of upgraded hardware and software to meet FLTCYBERCOM INFOSEC and other operational requirements. The ONE- NET enterprise consists of approximately 28,000 workstations (PC).  Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) Navy Enterprise Network (ONE-NET) extends across three regions: 1) Europe (EU), 2) Far East (FE), and 3) the Middle East (ME). The vendor shall provide PCs and IT Hardware in accordance with specifications and ship requested quantities to ONE-NET CONUS and OCONUS sites.
This requirement will be solicited as a total Small Business set-aside.  The SSC Pacific Small Business Office (SBO) and SBA Procurement Center Representative (PCR) concurred with the acquisition strategy decision on 28 July 2017.  A class non- manufacturer rule (NMR) waiver will apply to the solicitation. This waives the requirement for a non-manufacturer to supply the product of a small business concern.

SSC Pacific intends on awarding a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract line items (CLINs). The prospective contract will have a one-year base period with two one-year option periods. The anticipated ordering ceiling is to be determined (TBD). The NAICS code for this procurement is 334111 with a size standard of 1,250 employees.
A Bidders Mailing List will not be established and hard copies of documents will not be provided. The solicitation will only be available electronically on the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command E-Commerce Web Page at https://e- commerce.sscno.nmci.navy.mil under SSC Pacific - Open Solicitations. Any amendments, when issued, will also be available only on this web site.  Matters posted on the web site are not terms of the solicitation unless the solicitation is written or amended to include such matters. It is estimated that the solicitation will be released in the end of October 2017. FIRMS ARE ENCOURAGED TO REVIEW THE E-COMMERCE WEB SITE REGULARLY FOR UPDATED INFORMATION.
Integrated Technologies Group (ITG) is the incumbent contractor.

<div><strong>2. &nbsp;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Nature and Description of the action being approved</strong></div>
<div>This Limited Source Justification and Approval authorizes and approves the issuance of a follow-on contract to Abt Associates, 55 Wheeler St., Cambridge, MA, 02138, to continue conducting the H-1 B Technical Skills Training (H-1B) evaluation as the culmination of a competition on ETA's Research and Evaluation Initiatives Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). The H-1B evaluation is conducting an implementation and impact study of four H-1 B grants that includes conducting process studies, site visits, implementation and monitoring of random assignment, a follow-up survey, data analysis and reporting of findings from the evaluation.</div>
<div>The period of performance is anticipated to be 56 months from the date of award.</div>
<div><strong>3.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>A Description of the Supplies or Services required to meet the Agency' s Needs (Including the Estimated Value)</strong></div>
<div>The proposed action requires the contractor to build upon the existing order to complete the evaluation of the four H-I B grants selected for participation in the study and deliver reports with their findings to DOL. In order to do this, Abt Associates will use existing data collected in the baseline information form at enrollment, the follow-up survey, and administrative data, match and analyze that data to measure outcomes for participants, and disseminate the results of the evaluation.</div>
<div>It must be clear that through this evaluation, DOL is buying reports that tell us about the effectiveness of H-1B programs. Abt Associates houses the data that will tell us about participant outcomes, and they have agreements with the H-I B grantees and program participants about how the data will be used. DOL does not house and will not have access to any data that identifies program participants .</div>
<div>Current status</div>
<div>In order to complete the H-1B evaluation in a follow-on contract as described above, additional time and a small amount of resources are needed. &nbsp;An Independent Government Cost Estimate indicates that the additional net cost of this action is $200,000. &nbsp;Due to the delays described above, $3,997,852 (H-18 dollars, which is no-year money) not expended under the original contract has been de-obligated and will be re-obligated in September 2017 to this follow-on contract, along with an additional $200,000 from the Chief Evaluation Office, for a total of $4,197,852. The original contract will end early, on September 15, 2017, and the follow-on contract will begin immediately after and have a period of performance of 56 months. &nbsp;This new period of performance accounts for the government delays, including the grantees' enrollment challenges, and a longer-term follow-up period of data collection in order to meet the government's objectives for this independent, third party evaluation. &nbsp;It is a reasonable&nbsp;</div>
<div>timeframe to complete a project of this magnitude and meet the government's need. This additional action will cover all costs, including direct labor, subcontracts, travel, materials and supplies, and indirect costs.</div>
<div><strong>4.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Identification of the Authority and Rationale</strong></div>
<div>FAR 8.405-6 - Limiting Sources. This work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order in which the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. &nbsp;The original order was not previously issued under sole&shy; source or limited sources procedures. &nbsp;Abt Associates has rights to collect and maintain all the data already collected under the existing order, in accordance with applicable privacy laws, for the express purpose of conducting the H-1B evaluation. &nbsp;The services being provided under the H-1B evaluation are highly specialized and dependent on this data; without a follow-on, the time and money the Federal government has invested to-date would be lost.</div>
<div><strong>5.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Determination by the ordering activity that the order represents the best value FAR 8.404(d)</strong></div>
<div>Abt Associates is already under contract to DOL to conduct the H-1B implementation and impact evaluation and deliver reports on the study's findings. &nbsp;The evaluation team has already collected informed consent and baseline information on more than half of the study's participants; they can only use this data for the H-18 evaluation. &nbsp;And, they have already obtained Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to conduct the 18-month follow-up survey, which they have developed and administered to 639 people so far. They also have an evaluation design in place to complete data collection needed to meet the government' s requirement, including the necessary MOU with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to collect employment-related &nbsp;<br />administrative data on these participants' outcomes from the NDNH (via PII). Abt Associates is the only entity that can match this data to what they have already collected for the express purpose of conducting the H-1B evaluation.</div>
<div>The government .does not house or have access to this data, and no other contractor can access or use this data. This means that no other contractor can complete this work. Only Abt Associates can access the data collected to date and finalize the study.</div>
<div><strong>6.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>A Description &nbsp;of Market Research Conducted and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research was not conducted</strong></div>
<div>Abt Associates houses, and therefore is the only firm that has the authority to access and use, the data already collected under the H-1B evaluation, including the baseline information, follow-up survey, site visits, and administrative (NDNH) data. &nbsp;<br /><br />However, DOL staff conducted market research of similar firms which have provided services on similar evaluations of ETA grants, and have found the activities included in the request for the follow-on contract to be reasonable.</div>

<DESC>UNABLE TO ADD ATTACHMENTS:<br /><br />Signed J&amp;A presented in full below that was included as an attchment for pre-solicitation notice GSC-QF0B017-33149 posted to FBO on August 17, 2017.<br /><br />General Services Administration Federal Systems Integration and Management Center   JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION    The General Services Administration (GSA) makes this Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) for Other Than Full and Open Competition orders pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302. <br /> 1)    Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity: <br />Agency:  General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Systems Integration and Management Center (FEDSIM) Acting in support of: Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) <br />Contracting Activity: GSA FEDSIM Contracting Office 1800 F Street, NW Suite 3100 (QF0B) Washington, D.C. 20405 <br /> <br />2)    Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved: <br />The Global Threat Mitigation Program (GTMP) Task Order (TO) GSC0015AJ0047 was competitively awarded to Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) on a Cost-Plus Award Fee (CPAF) basis. The GTMP TO's awarded ceiling value was $937,419,229.00 and the Period of Performance (PoP) is from September 23, 2015 through September 22, 2020. The purpose of the GTMP TO is to provide the United States (U.S.) military, other military forces, and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) interagency partners responsible for combating threats and increasing the security posture of the U.S. and partner nation forces with assessments which identify and analyze evolving and emerging threats and provide potential capabilities the U.S. military can utilize to combat these threats. The capabilities provided include, but are not limited to, Information Operations (IO) activities, messaging platforms based on modern marketing techniques, Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) strategies, and CounterImprovised Explosive Device (C-IED) measures. The ultimate objective of the GTMP TO is to bolster the U.S.' security interests and positions, both at home and abroad, and to protect forces from emergent threats. <br /> <br />Since its inception, the GTMP TO has been highly successful at being able to quickly provide subject matter expertise and resources to military organizations requiring threat mitigation support. The level of demand across the U.S military for GTMP support far exceeded the Government's expectations and the user base of supported organizations has increased faster than originally planned. Within the first two years of its existence, supported GTMP organizations grew from seven to 45 military and partner organizations worldwide. This unplanned growth has been tremendously helpful with assisting the supported organizations combating and defending the U.S against ongoing and emerging threats at home and abroad. Included in the organizations supported under the GTMP TO is DIA. DIA has been able to successfully leverage the GTMP TO to support its all source <br />analysis requirements. The increased use of the GTMP TO has created ceiling challenges for organizations requiring more mission critical threat mitigation support, including DIA. To address the harmful implications and adverse impacts these ceiling challenges present to DIA's mission, GSA FEDSIM will be competitively awarding a new contract to support DIA's all source analysis requirements. Unfortunately, GTMP TO will not be able to support the continued use by DIA during its competitive pre-award phase.  DIA's ceiling demands during that period would severely affect other mission critical support of other commands. <br /> <br />As such, to ensure DIA is able to continue to receive threat mitigation support for its all source analysis requirements, GSA FEDSIM intends to award a 12-month sole source CPFF (Term) contract to BAH. Awarding this sole source contract will provide GSA FEDSIM the time required to complete the competitive source selection activities and transition of the DIA all source analysis requirements currently supported under GTMP to the competitively awarded contract as well as preserving the ceiling under GTMP to provide support for current and emerging operations. The estimated total value of the sole source contract will be $65,000,000 over the 12-month period. The resulting contract will also include the option to extend services clause, FAR 52.217-8, for an additional sixmonth period. FAR clause 52.217-8 will be included to account for circumstances beyond the control of GSA FEDSIM contracting such as protests. <br /> <br />3)     Description of Supplies/Services and Estimated Value: <br />The GTMP TO was awarded to provide U.S. military, other military forces, and U.S. DoD interagency partners support against threats such as Irregular Warfare (IrW), Hybrid Warfare, Asymmetric Warfare (AW) and regional threats such as hostile nation states, terrorist organizations, and extremists acting alone or in concert with global organizations. These global and prolific threats continue to drive GTMP supported organizations' strategic, operational, and tactical mission sets; planning and intelligence gathering activities; training requirements development; and, mission readiness requirements. The support provided under the GTMP TO continues to deliver mission critical solutions impacting the security interests of the GTMP supported organizations across these mission areas. Ultimately, the GTMP TO has enabled supported organizations to strengthen, defend, combat and defeat current, evolving and emerging threats on a daily basis throughout the world.  <br /> <br />Threat mitigation support for the DIA all source analysis requirements are currently supported under the GTMP TO. It is the Government's intention to competitively award an order to provide DIA a long-term solution for its all source analysis and threat mitigation support. While the Government completes all competitive source selection activities for that effort, DIA still requires contractor support for its current mission. During this time, BAH is in the unique position to continue to provide DIA the highly services at quality required without negatively impacting DIA current mission requirements. Specifically, DIA  requires continued contractor support to fulfill the following tasks currently being support through the GTMP TO: <br /> <br />a. Task 1 - Accounting for Contract Services b. Task 2 - Provide Program Management c. Task 3 - Execute Transition-Out d. Task 4 - Strategic Planning and Capabilities, Threat, and Intelligence Analyses and Assessments  e. Task 5  - Training Support  f. Task 6 - Surge Support  <br /> <br />The estimated value for Labor, Travel, Equipment and Material, Other Direct Cost (ODC) and Contract Access Fee (CAF) required to provide DIA continued all source analysis and threat mitigation support is provided below: <br /> <br />Description 12-Month Ceiling <br />Labor  $49,000,000 <br />Travel $1,500,000 <br />Equipment &amp; Material $6,500,000 <br />ODCs $7,936,000 <br />CAF $64,000 <br />TOTAL $65,000,000 <br /> <br />4)     Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: <br />This sole source contract will be awarded pursuant to the authority of 41 United States Code (U.S.C.) 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br />5)         Demonstration that the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited <br />The contractor's unique ability to mitigate mission risk, experience with the current capabilities, availability of cleared personnel and ability to allow for minimal transition risk which formed the basis for this justification are outlined below: <br /> <br />Mitigate Mission Risk: The DIA provides military intelligence to warfighters, defense policymakers and force planners in the DoD and the Intelligence Community, in support of U.S. military planning and operations and weapon systems acquisition. In support of that mission, DIA has been leveraging BAH's on-site support under the GTMP TO to provide threat mitigation support for its all source analysis requirements. The on-site GTMP support for DIA's current all source analysis requirements requires BAH to provide experienced, qualified, and appropriately cleared subject matter experts to ensure mission requirements are adequately supported. The GTMP support currently being provided to DIA by BAH was the result of months of approvals, strategic planning and resourcing through the GTMP TO by all parties involved: GSA FEDSIM, DIA, and BAH. DIA's current GTMP support continues to be driven by the threats impacting its mission, <br />operational environment and the Warfighter. The highly specialized nature of DIA all source analysis requirements and the contingent requirement for continuity of on-going mission operations has BAH in the unique position to provide and successfully transition that support when the source selections procedures for the competitive requirement are completed. <br />Experienced Contractor Support: The threat mitigation support currently being provided to DIA requires contractor support that is knowledgeable of the military tactics, techniques, and  procedures being used in support of the GTMP TO, as well as the operational and technical environment governing the on-going activities currently being supported by BAH under the GTMP TO. As the current GTMP incumbent, BAH was institutional in developing and executing the threat mitigation solutions brought to bear in support of the DIA current requirements including instances where support didn't previously exist. With ceiling challenges jeopardizing DIA's all source analysis requirements and the threat mitigation support currently being provided through the GTMP TO, BAH is in the unique position of currently having personnel on site with the requisite knowledge, subject matter expertise, and experience who are capable of providing continued support for those requirements without a break in service or adverse impacts to the DIA mission while source selection is conducted for a new TO. <br />Cleared Personnel: The contractor is required to provide cleared personnel due to the nature of the work being provided. The BAH contractor personnel currently providing support for the GTMP TO are required to access classified information. The GTMP BAH contractor personnel are responsible for safeguarding intelligence, information, and solutions in support of national security interests that are fostered through TO execution. As such, clearances for contractor personnel under the GTMP TO include requirements for Secret, Top Secret (TS), Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI), and TS/SCI with polygraph. In addition, the BAH personnel supporting GTMP requirements are co-located with DIA in order to effectively support mission requirements. BAH is the only contractor with the personnel currently on-site with the appropriate clearances who are capable of providing uninterrupted services until the follow-on TO is awarded. Failure to fully transition-in personnel with the appropriate clearances will hinder DIA's ability to adequately support the classified mission requirements through the TO. Ultimately, this inadequacy equates to mission failure for DIA given the security clearance requirements governing all personnel supporting mission requirements. <br />Minimized Transition Risk: The support provided to DIA through the GTMP TO is aimed at combatting threats and improving the security posture. This support impacts U.S. interests at home and abroad as well as the safety of the Warfighter. Accordingly, transitioning in a new contractor in support of such a critical mission can be detrimental with inadequate transition time. Successful transition of the current DIA mission  to a new contractor under a new contract will take a minimum of eight months to include a minimum of 60 days for transition-in period. Real-world events  could further impact this transition should emergency situations arise which require sustained support..  With the ceiling challenges currently jeopardizing DIA's ability to increase to scale in response to emerging and evolving threats, GSA FEDSIM will not have the time needed to complete all the acquisition activities to include contractor transition-in without possibly impacting DIA's ability to effectively support current mission requirements. DIA's missions rely on the threat mitigation support afforded to them through the GTMP TO; failure to fully transition-in a new contractor before the DIA exceeds the GTMP TO's ability to provide <br />the ceiling needed to support threat mitigation requirements and DIA's mission will result in negative consequences with real world implications. BAH is the only contractor in the position to provide support that will minimize the transition risks to DIA until the competitive contract can be awarded. <br />In summary, BAH is the only contractor with the personnel currently in place that possesses the required security clearances and experience to support DIA's current all source analysis and provide provide threat mitigation operational, tactical and strategic support. BAH currently has the personnel with requisite knowledge, expertise and institutional knowledge and technical expertise to achieve continuity of mission-critical services without interruption. Any attempt to replace BAH with another contractor without proper transition to turnover contractor support would jeopardize ongoing and future missions as well as the safety of warfighters and the people of the United States whom they protect. As a result, BAH is the only contractor capable of providing DIA the highly specialized services at the level required until the follow-on requirement is competitively awarded with an adequate transition-in period. <br />6)      Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as Practicable As required by FAR Part 5.201, a synopsis will be published on FedBizOpps to serve as the Government's notice of intent to sole source this acquisition. As previously indicated, the Government is in the process of preparing a competitive acquisition to which this sole source bridge contract will transition. As a result, the Government will not be soliciting offers from any sources other than BAH for this sole source acquisition. <br /> <br />7)      A Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable The estimated valued for this acquisition is $65,000,000. This estimate is based on the level of effort required to provide DIA continued support for current and emerging threats for 12 months. FEDSIM will compare the labor rates, hours, and costs for the sole source TO with the actual hours and costs being incurred under the current GTMP TO for these services. To ensure that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable, the Contracting Officer will evaluate the cost elements and fixed fee of BAH's proposed costs to ensure that the anticipated costs are fair and reasonable.  <br /> <br />8)      A Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research was not Conducted <br />For the above reasons stated in this Justification, market research was limited to the contract vehicles available to BAH for this sole source acquisition. Market research will be expanded to the greater marketplace for the competitive acquisition that will follow this sole source bridge contract. <br />9)     Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition <br /> <br />All relevant facts have been identified and discussed elsewhere in this justification. <br /> <br />10)    A Listing of the Sources, if any, That Expressed, In Writing, An Interest in the Acquisition <br /> <br />To date, the Contracting Officer has not received any statements of interest regarding the proposed sole source effort. <br />11)    A Statement of the Actions, if Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services Required <br /> <br />To ensure that the circumstances that led to the Government using other than full and open competition procedures for the sole source contract for this requirement are limited to this action only, the Government has implemented and is executing an acquisition schedule that will complete all the necessary pre-solicitation and pre-award actions before this bridge contract expires. Furthermore, to ensure that industry is made aware of all future information related to the follow-on requirement, all information will be posted and made available to all vendors under the contract vehicle selected for the follow-on requirement. <br /> <br />12)     Contracting Officer Certification that the Justification is Accurate and Complete to the Best of the Contracting Officer' s Knowledge and Belief <br />I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and determine on the basis of the findings above that other than full and open competition approach is in accordance with the requirements and is in the best interest of the Government. <br /> <br />________________________________________________________________________ <br />Jeffrey L.
