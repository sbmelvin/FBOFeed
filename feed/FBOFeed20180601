<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Solicitation No. W911QY-18-R-0018. The US Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division (NCD) on behalf of Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM-FSS), located at the Natick Soldier Systems Center intends to issue a solicitation under Authority of FAR part 15, for Expeditionary TRICON Self-Service Laundry System (ETSSLS).<br />As part of the ETSSLS pre-solicitation notice the draft solicitation has been made available for industry comments and feedback. The draft solicitation is available for download on FBO.
<p>The United States Army is modernizing the laundry system associated with the Force Provider (FP) program. FP is a containerized system with the objective to provide a stand-alone base camp capability for a broad array of Combat Service Support and Homeland Defense missions. Force Provider was originally Type Classified Standard in May of 1994 as a 550-personnel module capable of being complexed/combined to support a brigade sized force of 3300 personnel. Recent configuration changes allow the new module to support 600 personnel per module via four expeditionary base camps supporting 150 personnel each. This configuration is referred to as Force Provider Expeditionary (FPE) Life Support Module (LSM). Each 150 personnel FPE LSM contains 1 - Expeditionary TRICON Self-Service Laundry System (ETSSLS).</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a Joint Services requirement for the ETSSLS associated with this solicitation in support of hospitals and other deployable base-camp systems. By introducing standardized assets to the Joint Services community, FPE LSM can improve its maintenance repair supportability. The commonality of repair parts can be used to assist other services in maintaining overall operational readiness.</p>
<p>The government anticipates the solicitation will result in the initial award of a single Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract consisting of a five (5) year ordering period for the production of the ETSSLS. An award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the government considering a tradeoff of price and non-price factors.</p>
<p>Potential offerors are encouraged to provide comments to the government on the "DRAFT Solicitation". Please submit any comments or questions to Schon Zwakman at schon.m.zwakman.civ@mail.mil with the subject line "Comments ETSSLS Draft Solicitation W911QY-18-R-0018". Questions may not be answered based on the "DRAFT Solicitation" and submitted comments.</p>
<p>The formal solicitation is expected to be released in August/September 2018. When released, the formal solicitation, including all amendments, exhibits and attachments, will be available in electronic medium via www.fbo.gov (TELEPHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED).</p>
<p>A question and answer period will be available when the formal solicitation is released. During that timeframe questions shall be submitted no later than the date specified in the solicitation. The government will provide its answers to the questions. The government will not guarantee a response to any question and/or clarifications after the submission deadline stated in the solicitation.
