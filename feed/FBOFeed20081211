<DESC>The Air Force (AF) Total Force (Active, Air National Guard and Reserves) requires a complete solution set Data-at-Rest (DaR) encryption technology approach that integrates with the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) mandated Host Based Security System (HBSS) system.  The proposed strategy should leverage the Offeror's selected vendor's Subject Matter Expertise (SME) to affect the migration of ~800k existing machines throughout ~250 Air Force locations to provide an integrated Full Disk Encryption (FDE)/File Encryption System (FES) and Removable Storage Media (RSM) encryption system.  The Offeror's DaR solution must be capable of integrating with and being managed by the HBSS solution currently being deployed throughout the Air Force.  DaR target dates are to reach Field Service Evaluation (FSE) by Aug 2009 and fully deployed no later than 12 months after FSE.

<DESC>THERE ARE NO FUNDS AGAINST THE BAA SOLICITATION.  The U.S. Air Force Electronic Systems Center's Improvised Explosive Device Defeat (IEDD) program Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) identifies scientific and technical areas of interest for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement.  This BAA is conducted using full and open competition.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this BAA is presumed to be 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Although no portion of this BAA has been set aside for small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, historically underutilized business zone businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and/or minority institutions, participation from all these organizations is highly encouraged.  In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, this BAA utilizes a two-step proc! ess.  The first step will be the submission of a concept paper.  Offerors that submit concept papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the government will be invited to submit a proposal (step two).  Such an invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Instructions for the submission of concept papers and proposals are contained in the BAA.  The submission of a concept paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal.  Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award.  Proposals submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA.  Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process.  A proposal's technical evaluation, and its importance to agency programs, along with funding availability are primary bases for contract award.  Cost reasonableness shall also be considered to the exten! t appropriate.  Concept papers will be accepted continuously through 31 December 2010.  This BAA will remain open continuously through 31 January 2011.  The BAA technical areas of interest are for research work to develop and demonstrate technologies to improve virtually all aspects of performance related to next generation IEDD equipment in the areas of prediction, prevention, and detection of explosive threats.  All questions may be directed to the technical contact points listed in Section V of the BAA.

<ARCHDATE>01112010
<CONTACT>Matthew  Goodman, Program Manager - DSO, Email DARPA-BAA-09-19@darpa.mil
<DESC><p>DARPA is soliciting innovative research and development (R&amp;D) proposals in the area of Zeno-based Optoelectronics (ZOE). Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.
<p>The goal of this program is to create materials and prototype devices that will demonstrate a new class of optoelectronics that operate with ultra-low energy dissipation (~100 aJ/operation). The vision is a class of all-optical devices whose function depends on materials exhibiting strong optically-induced absorption, where the presence of one wavelength of light (control) induces the absorption of a second wavelength (signal). Application of such materials could lead to all-optical devices such as switches, wavelength converters, pulse regenerators, add/drop multiplexers, and memory cells that dissipate extremely small amounts of energy per operation.</p>
<p>Critical features that must be considered in the development of Zeno-based Optoelectronics include:</p>
<p>Materials Science: Development of practical materials (gas, liquid, or solid) that exhibit strong optically-induced absorption, over a wide range of signal and control wavelengths. Ideally, except when both control and signal are present, neither should be absorbed by the material. For a given control wavelength, the range of signal wavelengths that experience absorption should be narrow, to enable wavelength division multiplexing of a device.</p>
<p>Device Design: Design and demonstrate practical, scalable, low loss switching devices. Operating speeds should be in the 1-100 GHz range. Possible alternative all-optical devices including switches, add/drop multiplexers, low noise pulse regenerators, wavelength converters, and memory cells that achieve their function and meet the performance metrics outlined for an optical switch will be considered.</p>
<p>Architecture: Because the control wavelength experiences only minute dissipation in the envisioned devices, it is conceivable that the control energy could be recycled and re-used. Scalable architectures need to be developed to take advantage of any possible energy savings.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement for Software Test Programming Services.  The objective of the FAA is to obtain test software and hardware such that an operator using the application software test program with appropriate fixture and complete operator prompting instructions shall be capable of isolating faults to a confidence factor of 90% or greater. The Contractor shall use an automated fault isolation process using in-circuit test process to the maximum extent possible.
Two basic programming tasks will be needed:
1)	Migration of test programs from a Hewlett Packard HP3065 tester to a Teradyne Test-Station 8X tester:
 	A .ckt file already exists for each of these test programs, therefore the contractor will not have to create one. New test fixtures will have to be manufactured / procured for these test programs.
2)	Migration of test programs from a Genrad 2272 tester to a Teradyne Test-Station 8X tester:Since the Genrad 2272 test program files already exist for these programs, the contractor will use the built in Genrad 2272 to Test-station 8x migration feature of the Test-Station 8x. This will significantly reduce test program development time. No new test fixtures will be required for these programs.The existing test fixtures will be re-used. In many cases, changes in the test fixture wiring will be required.A list of personnel that the contractor will use for the programming services must be supplied to the FAA. 
These personnel must have at least 4 years of Teradyne Test-Station 8X and/or Genrad 228x programming experience.
The contractor must supply a list of customer references for whom they have developed Teradyne Test-Station 8X or Genrad 228x test programs.
The contractor must have a Teradyne Test-Station 8X tester (or a Genrad 228x tester) at their facility with which, they will develop and debug test programs.  Upon completion of test program development the contractor must perform a verification of the test program, on-site at the FAA, on the FAA's Teradyne Test-Station 8X.	
All files created and/or used by the contractor in the development of the test programs shall be delivered on CDROM, and will become property of the Government. 
Responses to this market survey will be used to develop the source list for this requirement and to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, or the 8(a) program in lieu of opening the acquisition up for full and open competition.  
Interested vendors should respond by completing and returning the attached Business Declaration Form.   The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541511, with a small business size standard of $23 Million.
The survey is not to be construed as a screening information request (SIR), nor request for offer (RFO).  As such, the FAA will not accept unsolicited proposals and will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial response.  The final determination by the FAA not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the FAA.
Please include #08-05067 for any responses to this survey.  Any questions must be submitted in writing and emailed to christopher.ekadis@faa.gov, prior to December 18, 2008.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to make an award to SOFTEON INC for the purchase of Software Maintenance for Enterprise Logistics Information Technology (ELITE) System. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The IRS has a continuing for need for the ELITE inventory and distribution system, which is used to distribute published products to taxpayers and other customers.  Discontinuation of the maintenance services would have an adverse impact, cause a work stoppage in the distribution of published products, and cause undue burden on taxpayers. This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids. The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action. If parties choose to respond, rresponsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency however, any cost associated with the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government..  The current contract consists of annual maintenance for the Enterprise Logistics Information Technology (ELITE), which allows the IRS to distribute published products to taxpayers and other customers.

<DESC><p>The National Data Buoy Center intends to negotiate only with Parascientific Inc. of Redmond&nbsp; WA for 6 Each, Model 410K-101 Pressure Transducers (P/N: 1223-001-0).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The NDBC uses the transducers ao all existing Deep-Ocean Assesment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) systems contained within the bottom pressure recorder (BPR).&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the DART electrical, mechanical, and electronic equipment currently used in the DART program and on DART buoys is the result of custom engineering design and fabrication accomplished by PMEL directly, or through sole-source contractors, and much of it is proprietary. During the design process, PMEL integrated several custom manufactured electronics assemblies into the electronic sensor and data acquisition system used on the DART buoys. The buoy electronic assembly is the DART Acoustic Modem/CPU Assembly, which PMEL built, and which consists of several proprietary, custom designed printed circuit boards for controlling the Acoustic Modem/Acoustic Release sensor suite. Three Dart Benthos Acoustic Modem/CPU Assemblies and one Paroscientific Bottom Pressure Transducer are used on every DART buoy in the present PMEL designed configuration. Two of the Modem/CPU assemblies are used in the Dart buoy hull, one for primary data acquisition, and one as a secondary system in case of failure of the primary unit; the third is used in the Bottom Pressure Sensor suite.. There are also other custom designed peripheral equipment integral to the operation of the DART buoy, including two Benthos Acoustic Modem Transducers used for wireless acoustic signal communications with the bottom pressure sensor equipment suite, an EdgeTech Acoustic release Module which can be used to release the the Bottom Pressure Sensor suite from the mooring for recovery.&nbsp; Additionally, there is a locally fabricated DART GOES Transmitter Assembly for transmitting the pressure data messages through the GOES satellite uplink, and an externally mounted RF Modem Assembly used for line-of-sight data recovery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bottom Pressure Sensor suite of equipment which includes the third DART Acoustic Modem/CPU Assembly, also contains a very special Paroscientific pressure transducer as the ocean floor or seabed sensor. This is one of the most critical parts of the system because the pressure transducer sits on the ocean floor and sends pressure data back to the electronics data acquisition units on the buoy via acoustic modems, and changes in the pressure data is the first sign of an approaching tsunami. PMEL selected the Paroscientific Model 410K-101 for use as the DART Bottom Pressure Sensor and it is now integral to the design; no other known sensor meets the design requirements, and Paroscientific is the only vendor who can supply these subassemblies because they are proprietary to the company.</p>

Thus, the Benthos acoustic modem PCB are used in the current DART systems and are being procured to complete the remainder of the DART buoys, for future DART buoys, and for continuing DART support operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The firmware and drivers that control these modem functions are deeply embedded in the DART system design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The requested Benthos transducers and modem PCBs currently used in the DART system are the only components that can work in the system and as replacements on the deployed buoys. &nbsp;Presently Benthos is the only known vendor that meets the requirements for the DART II program.</p>

(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet.
(b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).  
(c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.  (End of Provision)

SUP 5252.213-9402 Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance-Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (Apr 1999)
ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet.(b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f! irst article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.  (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows:	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.(e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data.(End of Provision)

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) intends to issue a sole source award to Fischer Scientific for Boric Acid powder ACS #A74-3. This notice is per FAR citation 6.302-1.
<p>The BEP uses boric acid as a buffer in the nickel plating tanks. These tanks are used in the production of the BEP's currency plates and other securities. The boric acid needs to be in a fine powder form and ACS certified. As Fischer Scientific brand boric acid powder is added to the tanks, it floats on top of the solution and is absorbed slowly. The gradual absorption allows the solution to adjust the PH without a sudden change. The boric acid powder ordered previously, from non Fischer Scientific sources, sank to the bottom of the tank and was rapidly absorbed into the solution. This rapid absorption caused an abrupt change in the PH of the tank solution. Fischer Scientific is able to produce high quality and pure plating chemicals which are a requirement in the production of the currency plates. It is in the best interest of the BEP to purchase boric acid from Fischer Scientific.</p>
<p>The BEP is seeking small firms that are authorized resellers of Fischer Scientific boric acid powder ACS #A74-3. If none are available, the purchase will be made directly to Fischer Scientific.</p>
<p>If your firm is able to provide Fischer Scientific for Boric Acid powder ACS #A74-3 please contact: Kathleen Reidy, Contract Specialist, at 202-874-2507 or Kathleen.Reidy@bep.treas.gov by Thursday December 18, 2008 2 PM EST.</p>

NOTE:  "Figure 1. Functional Organization of GTEx"  and "Appendix A. Tentative Prioritized Tissue List - Autopsy/Transplant Donors" are provided as attachments and are located on a separate tab. 

Notice Number:  LDACC-10-01

Project Title: Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project  Laboratory, Data Analysis, and Coordinating Center (LDACC) 

I. Overview of the GTEx Project

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking small businesses with the capability to serve as a Laboratory, Data Analysis, and Coordinating Center (LDACC) for a new pilot program: the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project.  

What follows below is a description of the entire project and instructions on how to respond to this notice with your capability statement.  Please note, this Sources Sought Notice asks for a capability statement regarding the LDACC portion only.  It is understood no one entity may have the requisite experience to perform all functions of the project.  Therefore subcontracting may be appropriate.  The components that may be considered for subcontracting as an example include:  cell culture (fibroblast and lymphoblastoid), sequencing based RNA expression analysis, chip-based RNA expression analysis, genotyping; all of the components of the Tissue Receiving & Storage Center (TRSC) - tissue storage, histopathology processing, and expert pathology review. 

A. Purpose of the GTEx Project

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS; See: http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies) have shown great promise in identifying genetic loci associated with common human diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and psychiatric conditions.  Despite this progress, the majority of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other genetic changes lie outside of the protein-coding regions of genes and often even outside of the genes themselves, making it difficult to discern which genes underlie the association and by what mechanism. 

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, an NIH Roadmap Initiative (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/GTEx/), aims to provide a resource to the scientific community with which to study the relationship between genetic variation and human gene expression and regulation.  This project will collect and analyze multiple human tissues from donors who have been characterized for germline genetic variation through dense genotyping.  By analyzing global RNA expression within individual tissues and treating the gene expression levels as quantitative traits, variations in expression that are highly correlated with genetic variation will be identified as expression quantitative trait loci, or eQTLs.  The SNPs that are correlated with a transcript level are known as eSNPs.  Based on analysis of individual tissues, approximately 10% or more of gene transcripts are cis-eQTLs, meaning that the eSNP is located close to the gene.  To identify trans-eQTLs, meaning those in which the eSNP maps far from the gene, or on a different chromosome than the gene it is regulating, much larger sample sizes will be required.  This is because of the need to adjust for the large number of statistical tests involved in searching for correlation between every transcript and a very large number of genetic variants. Comprehensive identification of both cis- and trans-eQTLs will provide a valuable basis on which to study gene regulation, with an immediate application in interpreting GWAS study findings.

The GTEx project will begin with a 2.5- to 3-year pilot in FY10.  As developed at a June 2008 GTEx Workshop (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/GTEx/workshop0608), the primary goal of the pilot is to assess the feasibility of enrolling 160 donors identified through low post-mortem interval (PMI) autopsy or organ transplant settings and collecting high-quality RNA from thirty or more tissues per donor.

RNA quality will be measured by technical characteristics and performance on commercial expression arrays, and next-generation sequencing platforms will also be evaluated.  The influence of factors such as mode of death and PMI on RNA quality measures will also be evaluated. For a small subset of tissues (approximately 5), collection from a similar number of living surgery patients will also be performed to compare to the quality of autopsy-derived tissues.  Peripheral blood samples will be used as a source of DNA for whole-genome SNP genotyping assays and for establishment of lymphoblastoid cell lines, and fibroblast cultures will be established from skin samples from all donors.  Analysis of cis-eQTLs from GTEx derived tissues will be compared, where possible, to existing, single-tissue datasets, and the optimal number of tissues needed to identify the majority of eQTLs will be evaluated. 

Final quantitative scale-up criteria to be met during the pilot will be provided by the NIH before contract negotiation/awards are made, but will include factors and criteria such as:

  Enrollment of 160 autopsy/transplant donors, or at least 100 autopsy/transplant donors by   the end of the pilot and at least 10 donors per month in each of the final three months of recruitment.

  The six highest-priority tissues are collected from 70-80% of all donors, and the 24 next highest-priority tissues are collected from at least 70-80% of all donors within the final three months of recruitment.

  At least 70-80% of all samples have an RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of at least 4-6, and for the six highest-priority tissues, at least 70-80% have a RIN of at least 6-8.

  At least 85-95% of donors are successfully genotyped using high-density genotyping SNP arrays with SNP call rates of 90-98%.

The GTEx Pilot Project also aims to determine the optimal number of tissue types needed to sample, based on the redundancy of eQTL results across multiple tissue types, and to evaluate the effects of mode of death, postmortem interval, and sample collection factors on RNA quality and eQTL results.  If the aims of the GTEx Pilot Project are achieved, the project may be expanded, in the following 3 years, to involve multiple tissues from an additional ~900 donors. 

B. Organization of the GTEx Pilot Project

The GTEx Pilot Project comprises two main initiatives: (1) The Laboratory, Data Analysis and Coordinating Center (LDACC), the subject of this Sources Sought Notice (see II. below), and (2) the Donor Recruitment and Tissue Collection Centers (DRTCC), which will involve a separate request for proposal (RFP).  A third functional area, the Tissue Receiving and Storage Center (TRSC) may be included within the LDACC or DRTCC initiatives, or funded separately. Some of the brain tissue may be sent to an NIH-supported Brain Bank funded separately.

The GTEx Pilot Project also includes development of a GTEx database (within the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)) and a separate Request for Applications for the development of improved statistical data analysis methods.

The functional relationship of these components within the overall GTEx Project is shown in Figure 1. 

C. GTEx Project Phasing Schedule 

The GTEx Project will be conducted in three phases, with an optional fourth phase, as outlined below. The first three phases will be conducted over two and one half to three years, beginning in FY10. The optional phase four, for three additional years, will be executed if the Pilot Project meets its goals and funding is secured. 

Phase 1 - Planning & Testing (5-7 months)
Phase 1 will involve finalizing IRB approvals, where required, and development and harmonization of final protocols for donor recruitment and sample collection, shipping and tracking, and optimizing protocols for histopathology processing and molecular analysis of tissues.  This phase will involve biweekly teleconference calls and one in-person meeting between DRTCCs and LDACC Investigators.  A small number of donors will be enrolled at each site from which the top 6 tissues will be collected, to test the sample collection, handling, shipping, and tracking procedures.

Phase 2 - Active Pilot Data Collection (16-18 months)
Phase 2 will involve active collection of tissue from the targeted 320 donors (160 autopsy and 160 surgery patients) over a maximum of 16 months of subject enrollment.  There may be a ramp-up in the number of tissues collected from each donor, dependent on feasibility assessed in Phase 1.  Molecular analyses at the LDACC will be ongoing during this phase, and will be completed within 2 months of sample receipt.

Phase 3 - Preliminary Analysis and Evaluation of Pilot (6-8 months)
Phase 3 will involve statistical analysis of all available molecular and process data in order to assess whether scale-up criteria were met.  Results will be used to inform the design and timing of an optional phase 4.

Phase 4 - Optional Scale-up (36 months)
Phase 4 is an optional, three-year, scale-up phase, to enroll approximately 900 additional donors, collecting the optimal number of tissues from each, analyzed with the most comprehensive, yet cost-effective, quantitative RNA expression analysis platform. 

Proceeding to Phase 4 is contingent on achieving the GTEx Project goals and the availability of adequate funds.

D. DRTCC Initiative: The Donor Recruitment & Tissue Collection Center (DRTCC) initiative will consist of 2-5 sites that will identify and enroll donors and acquire multiple tissue samples from each, using best practices for sample collection, handling, fixation, and storage. 
The total number of autopsy or organ transplant donors to be enrolled by the DRTCCs is 160, and the total number of surgical donors is also 160.  Ideally, 50-70 tissues per autopsy/transplant donor will be collected, while 4-6 tissues per surgical donor will be collected, yielding a total of 8800-12,000 tissue samples.  These samples will be obtained over 15 to 18 months. (See Appendix A for a tentative list of target tissues.)

The collected blood samples and tissue aliquots will be shipped to the Tissue Receiving & Storage Center (TRSC), described in II.C., for histopathology analysis and long-term storage. The TRSC will forward a portion of the blood and tissue samples from each donor to the Molecular Analysis Laboratory (within the LDACC) for processing and analysis.  

One or more of the DRTCCs will also conduct a study of the GTEx consent process, to assess its impact on surgical donors and families of deceased donors in order to optimize the consent process utilized in phase 4, should it be funded.

II.  Laboratory, Data Analysis, and Coordinating Center (LDACC):  The LDACC, which is the subject of this Sources Sought Notice, will provide two major functions: a Data Analysis & Coordination Center and a Molecular Analysis Laboratory.  NHLBI reserves the option to fund a third function, a Tissue Receiving & Storage Center (TRSC), either as part of the LDACC, separately, or as a component of one of the DRTCCs, depending on the offerors facilities, experience and skills of personnel, and total TRSC cost. 

A. Data Analysis and Coordination Center

The Data Analysis and Coordination Center will have overall responsibility for coordinating the many GTEx components, most notably the LDACC and DRTCCs.  This will require close coordination with multiple Donor Recruitment and Tissue Collection Centers (DRTCCs), funded separately, to finalize study protocols and data collection forms; to design and implement a donor and tissue tracking system, including sample barcoding; and to establish (and/or monitor) an expert pathologist review system for collected tissues.  The LDACC will also monitor study progress and quality of DRTCC and laboratory performance, and prepare statistical and other reports, as needed, establish and manage Project Committees and an Observational Study Monitoring Board (OSMB), and provide monthly detailed reports to the NIH Project Officer on the progress of the study.  In addition, the LDACC will:

(1) Design and implement a comprehensive Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), including barcode-based identification of all GTEx-related patient information and tissue samples.

The LIMS will track and provide real-time access to all related patient and tissue information, including: identification of the tissue donor; verification of proper patient or family consent; GTEx-defined clinical history and family history; inventory of all patient tissue samples collected and type of collection vessels; shipment of patient samples from the DRTCC to the LDACC.  The information for these tasks will be collected by the DRTCC.  

The LIMS also will track receipt of patient samples at the TRSC; transfer of samples and derived materials within each location of the LDACC; status of sample analysis; results of analysis by the LDACC; and storage of tissue samples at the TRSC. 

(2) Work closely with the DRTCCs to design a standardized set of data collection forms and barcoded labels to link all clinical, family, and associated information about donors and their tissue specimens.

(3) Work closely with the DRTCCs to design a standardized set of tissue specimen collection containers and barcoded labels to link and track every specimen and associated aliquot processed at the DRTCCs.

(4) Create a database of all clinical and family history and related information collected on each donor, together with all laboratory data generated by the Molecular Analysis Laboratory from the donor tissues.

(5) Perform basic analysis of data resulting from genotyping and expression analyses performed by the Molecular Analysis Laboratory, including data quality filtering and normalization of global RNA expression and genotyping chip data. The evaluation of cis expression quantitative traits (eQTLs; defined as RNA expression levels correlated with SNPs within an arbitrary distance from the transcription start site of the gene), and analysis of next-generation sequencing-based expression data, will be performed through the GTEx Database and statistical methods RFA, funded separately.

(6) Submit an NIH-specified subset of data (all laboratory data, including raw output files and associated metadata, and specified clinical information collected from each donor) to NCBI (part of NIH) for inclusion in the GTEx database.

The LDACC will work closely with NCBI to deposit individual-level clinical and phenotypic information into the NCBI dbGaP database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gap&cmd=search&term= ) and individual-level expression results, both raw and processed data, into the NCBI GEO database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez ).  A controlled access system, similar to the current GWAS data within dbGaP, will be developed separately from this solicitation, using data provided by the LDACC.  It is anticipated that summary statistical calculations of correlation between genetic variants and RNA expression values will be provided, without restriction, to the scientific community through the GTEx database developed by NCBI.

(7) Establish quality criteria and monitor, analyze, and report these measures for the number of donors and tissues at each DRTCC, the laboratory processing of all specimens, and overall progress of the study for the Observational Study Monitoring Board (OSMB) and NIH Project Officer. These data reports will be included in monthly progress reports to the NIH Project Officer.

(8) Provide detailed monthly reports on the progress of all DRTCC and LDACC Pilot Project activities to the NIH Project Officer.

(9)  Participate in yearly reviews, at the NIH campus in Bethesda, MD, with other GTEx participants and the NIH GTEx administrative staff.

B. Molecular Analysis Laboratory  

This facility will:  

(1) Receive incoming tissue aliquots from the Tissue Receiving & Storage Center (TRSC) and process these tissue aliquots to yield purified DNA and RNA.  Test samples may be received within 4 months of contract award, while full sample shipments are expected within approximately 6-9 months of the contract award.  During the interim, the Molecular Analysis Laboratory will verify and develop, wherever needed, tissue-specific protocols that will yield high-quality RNA and DNA from the highest priority tissues, listed in Appendix A. 

The tissue processing will include:

a. Homogenizing one frozen aliquot of tissue, to yield uniform material for nucleic acid analysis, so that duplicate experiments, or experiments performed using different protocols or platforms, utilize the same cellular mixture as starting material.

b. Extracting RNA, and possibly DNA, from homogenized aliquots using protocols optimal for each tissue, which will be proposed by the offeror and approved by NIH Project Officer, with storage of remaining material for future use.

(2) Perform whole-genome mRNA expression analysis, using commercially available microarray chip products, using RNA samples extracted from approximately 8,800 tissue aliquots.  The ability to increase the number of samples, to 50,000 or more, to be analyzed during the optional phase four, should also be indicated.

(3) Perform genome-wide genotyping analysis using a commercially available microarray single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip product containing at least 500,000 genetic variants (Affymetrix, Illumina, or comparable product) using the DNA sample from each donor.  

(4) Perform next-generation, sequencing-based whole transcriptome analysis on a specified subset of 300 tissue RNA samples. Assuming the GTEx Pilot Project meets its goals and the optional phase 4 is executed to analyze samples from an additional 900 patients over a 3-year period, a sequencing-based RNA expression analysis platform may be preferred at that time.  Thus we wish to evaluate the feasibility of this strategy both as to how GTEx collected tissues perform on these platforms, and how the data may be analyzed to obtain quantitative expression measures. The ability to increase the number of RNA sequence based analyses, to 50,000 or more, to be analyzed during the optional phase four, should also be indicated.

(5) Operate a cell culture facility that prepares EBV-transformed lymphocyte cell lines from white blood cells of donor blood samples, and prepares primary fibroblast cell lines from donor skin samples.

C. Tissue Receiving & Storage Center (TRSC). 

NHLBI may fund the Tissue Receiving and Storage Center (TRSC) functions within the LDACC, within one of the Donor Recruitment and Tissue Collection Centers, or entirely separately. 

This facility will:

(1)  Provide specimen containers, tracking labels, and shipping material to an anticipated 2-5 DRTCCs, to accommodate the individual tissue aliquots outlined above (up to 60,000 tissue aliquots). Procedures for shipping and handling must be developed in coordination with DRTCCs. Specimens will be shipped to the TRSC in several states: frozen (liquid nitrogen), on wet-ice, and at room temperature (for formalin-fixed tissue, and blood and skin samples in culture media).

The TRSC will have an approximately five-month period, from the time of the contract award, to prepare for the receipt, initial handling, and storage of solid tissue and blood samples.

(2) Receive overnight shipments of frozen tissue from the DRTCCs. For each tissue aliquot obtained, the TRSC will send one frozen aliquot to the Molecular Analysis Lab for extraction of RNA for expression analysis. The remaining two frozen aliquots from each tissue sample will be placed in refrigerated storage (See (8), below). 

(3)  Receive overnight shipments of skin samples in media at room temperature.  The TRSC will send these samples to the tissue culture facility, within the Molecular Analysis Laboratory, to establish a fibroblast primary cell line for each donor. 

(4)  Receive overnight shipments of blood samples.  The TRSC will send an aliquot of the blood sample to the tissue culture facility, within the Molecular Analysis Laboratory, to establish an EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line for each donor.  The TRSC will send the remainder of the blood sample to the Molecular Analysis Laboratory for extraction and analysis of genomic DNA from white blood cells. 

(5) Tissue aliquots received in fixative will be paraffin embedded, aliquoted on a microtome, placed on a single microscope slide, and stained with hematoxylin & eosin. The tissue processing should be highly standardized, ideally using an automated system, which should be described.  

(6) Design and implement a system to digitally scan histopathology slides of all tissue specimens undergoing molecular analysis and store images in the LDACC database, accessible for review by outside pathologists.  These images will be linked to other individual-level data, which will also be made available to approved users of the controlled access data, available through the GTEx Database at NCBI.  Please indicate the system you envision using for this task.

(7) Establish and coordinate a panel of expert pathologists to review pathology slides from all tissue specimens, to verify the organ source of the tissue and to characterize the pathophysiologic state of the tissue. The resulting interpretations will be entered into the LDACC database, using a data collection form developed by the LDACC for each tissue type. 

(8) Provide long-term storage for the remaining tissue aliquots (most in liquid nitrogen, some possibly at -20 C in frost-free freezers or refrigerated at 5 C) in temperature-controlled freezers and refrigerators, with alarms and 24-hour monitoring systems.

<DESC><p>The Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Medical Center (FMC Butner), intends to award a sole source purchase order to UNC Healthcare, Chapel Huill, NC. To provide care to inmates referred for inpatient and outpatient care when care is not otherwise available from the contract provider (MDI), such continuity of care is to avoid unnecessary legal exposure. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1 - only responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. The NAICS code is 622110. To the best of our knowledge, UNC Healthcare is the only provider of this service. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, as no solicitation document is available. However any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give a written or fax notification to the Contracting Officer within five (5) calendar days from the date of this published synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer, FMC Butner, Attn: Teresa Cooper, P O Box 999, Butner, NC 27509. Information can be faxed to 919-575-4821. Responses received will be evaluated, however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, FMC Butner will proceed with the sole source negotiated with UNC Healthcare.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This Special Notice is a <strong>Request for Information</strong> (RFI) to facilitate CDC's market research efforts to determine an acquisition strategy for a new requirement described below. This is not a solicitation and thus proposals are not requested and will not be accepted. Please do not request to be added to a "bidders list" because the contracting officer will not create such a list since any resulting solicitation will be posted to FEDBIZOPS for all interested and eligible offerors to respond.
<p><strong>Background</strong>: The National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects (NCEH/DEHHE) requires various services broadly described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW). Such services are presently performed by numerous contractors. CDC seeks to consolidate (a.k.a. "bundle") such services under a single, task order contract to streamline the acquisition process, reduce acquisition lead times, reduce the administrative burden, and increase the overall efficiency of acquiring such services. The contracting officer will coordinate the results of this market research with the Small Business Administration (SBA) procurement center representative (PCR) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 10.001(e) for a final acquisition strategy determination. In accordance with FAR 10.0001 (c)(2)(ii), the contracting officer will notify "...the affected incumbent small business concerns of the Government's intention to bundle the requirement..." once the acquisition strategy determination is made.</p>
<p><strong>Objective of RFI</strong>: Offerors interested in the contemplated acquisition are invited to submit a <strong>capability statement</strong> (in accordance with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response Instructions</span> below) to demonstrate the depth and breadth of their professional and scientific capabilities to perform the services described in the attached draft SOW. The primary purpose of this RFI is to determine whether or not adequate competition exists among small businesses to conduct a small business set aside acquisition. Thus, small businesses, in particular, are encouraged to respond to this RFI. Any solicitation and resulting contract awarded on the basis of a small business set aside will include Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14 Limitation on Subcontracting. This clause requires that "At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern." The full text of the clause is provided as an attachment to this RFI.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Information</strong>: Key features of the contemplated contract:</p>
<p>1. Contract type: Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Task Order;<br />2. Task Order Type: each task order may be either Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) , Firm Fixed Price (FFP) or a combination of CPFF and FFP depending upon the nature of the requirement;<br />3. Single Award;<br />4. Duration: Base Year plus 4, one-year Option periods;<br />5. Total (initial) estimated ceiling price: $20M.</p>
<p><strong>Response Instructions</strong>: Prepare and submit your response as follows:</p>
<p>1. Name and address of business and point of contact information (phone # and email address);</p>
<p>2. Identify your business size status relative to NAICS code: 541990 Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services $7.0M Note: Offerors may comment on the NAICS code selected and propose an alternate NAICS code that the contracting officer may consider if the contracting officer determines that the alternate NAICS code is more representative of the services being acquired. The NAICS code manual is available at: http://www.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_sstd_tablepdf.pdf</p>
<p>3. Provide a one page introduction of your company.</p>
<p>4. Discuss your capabilities, resources (e.g. personnel, facilities, ability to subcontract services not otherwise available in-house), technical knowledge and experience for each of the following topics 'a' thru 'f':</p>
<p>a. Epidemiologic concepts, principles, and practices as they relate to environmental hazards and other special epidemiologic programs (e.g., natural and manmade toxins, public health disaster surveillance and response, water quality, exposure assessment);<br />b. Scientific expertise and technical assistance in planning, designing, and implementing environmental epidemiology studies of current or potential public health problems related to environmental exposures (e.g., pesticides, metals, poisons, toxins, technologic and natural disasters);<br />c. Surveillance systems and data, especially the practices and special considerations for establishing systems and analyzing and interpreting data;<br />d. Federal regulations and policies regarding human subjects, privacy, and contractual procedures;<br />e. Public relations, health education, health communication related to complex epidemiology studies and sometimes sensitive environmental exposure issues;<br />f. Identify relevant examples of past and/or current experience and include a brief explanation of the nature of the work, labor skill mix used and dollar value. Such examples should relate to the General Functional Areas listed in the attached draft SOW. For each example, identify what percentage of the work was performed by in-house employees versus subcontractor or consulting personnel.</p>
<p>5. Interested offerors may also comment on the draft SOW and may suggest changes which the Government will consider when developing the final SOW. Any suggested changes should include a brief explanation for the advantages / benefits such suggestions will contribute to the SOW. Note: SOW comments are optional.</p>
<p>6. Page limit: 15</p>
<p>7. Submit response to the contracting officer via email: FTG7@cdc.gov not later than the response due date and time stipulated in this RFI notice. FAX responses are not acceptable unless otherwise authorized.</p>

<DESC><p>"The USAF Academy has a Brand Name Only requirement to purchase A-Dec, model 6300 ceiling mount dental lights. Subsequently A-Dec only sells direct to Government customers, not through distributors. The 10th Dental Squadron has determined this to be the only product that meets all its required features and functionality based on following justification: currently the dental squadron uses A-Dec brand dental chairs which are only compatible with A-Dec brand lights. The lights can be turned on and off with touchpad controls located on the chair reducing the risk of infection. The use of non-compatible lights with A-Dec chairs would create an unnecessary health risk. The third axis of rotation allows for better lighting of the oral cavity, is more efficient, possesses superior ergonomics and is easier to use.

<DESC>The following sentence is hereby deleted from the fourth paragraph of SpecialAnnouncement W15QKN-09-Z-0306:
Parties interested in participating in both demonstrations must provide a different design for each demonstration. 

Therefore, the fourth paragraph of the announcement is changed... 
from:This demonstration is in addition to the 120mm mortar/105mm artillery demonstration in September 2009, which is discussed in Special Notices W15QKN-09-Z-0304 and W15QKN-09-Z-0305, and does not preclude industry from participating in the 120mm mortar portion of that demonstration. Parties interested in participating in both demonstrations must provide a different design for each demonstration.
to:This demonstration is in addition to the 120mm mortar/105mm artillery demonstration in September 2009, which is discussed in Special Notices W15QKN-09-Z-0304 and W15QKN-09-Z-0305, and does not preclude industry from participating in the 120mm mortar portion of that demonstration.


The primary reason for removing the sentence is that the wording unduly restricts the ability of a party with limited success results during the March demonstration to make the necessary fixes to their existing design and have the opportunity to demonstrate their capability during the September demonstration.
The POC for this special notice is Jeff S. Cheung, CGCM APO, 973-724-6780, jeff.cheung@us.army.mil.

GENERAL<BR><BR>C.1.1.	The contractor must provide personnel, equipment, tools, materials, and supervision to install a pilot controlled lighting system (PCLS) and bird and wildlife dispersal systems at Daniel Oduber Quiros International Airport (MRLB) in Liberia, Costa Rica.<BR><BR>C.1.2.	BACKGROUND INFORMATION.  United States Government aircraft operating from Liberia have, on occasion for operational reasons, landed after the airport has officially closed.  A great deal of coordination and expense has been required to reopen the airport and illuminate the runway each time this has occurred.  Installation of a PCLS, operating in the VHF spectrum (preferably the current tower frequency), would both enhance operational capability and reduce overall operating costs.   <BR><BR>C.1.2.1.	REQUIREMENTS.  The PCLS must be tied to a VHF frequency (preferably the current tower frequency) and allow for a minimum of 3 intensities (40, 60, and 100% of full intensity).  The variable intensity will allow optimum visibility during an approach and landing into the airport under varying weather conditions.  Upon pilot activation, the lights should remain on for a period of no less than 15 minutes.  <BR><BR>C.1.2.2.	Due to the high bird activity at the airport in Liberia after dusk and before dawn, a bird and wildlife dispersal system needs to be installed as well and must work in conjunction with the Pilot Controlled Lighting System. This system (referred to as bird cannons) should be operated on a time delay so as not to discharge immediately upon activation of the Pilot Controlled Lighting.<BR>In addition to the PCLS, two bird cannons will be installed in the vicinity of the approach end and the mid-field section of the runway.  Activated by the PCLS, the bird cannons would be sequentially fired by propane charges to disperse birds and other wildlife from the vicinity of the runway, prior to the aircraft approach.  These systems would address safety of flight issues encountered with high levels of bird activity after dusk and before dawn at the airport.	<BR><BR>C.1.3.		PERSONNEL.<BR><BR>C.1.3.1.	Personnel performing the installation of the PCLS and bird cannons must possess the requisite technical qualifications as determined by the contractor.  No security clearances are required.  As the installation is to be performed in Liberia, Costa Rica, contractor personnel, if U.S. citizens, must possess current tourist passports.  Spanish language skills are desirable, but not required.<BR><BR>C.1.3.1.1.	TIME LIMITS.  Installation of the PCLS and bird cannons is desired to be completed no later than 1 April 2009, as feasible.  The length of time required for the installation is estimated at forty (40) man-hours.  Actual hours required are to be determined between the Contracting Officer and the contractor.  <BR><BR>C.1.4.	PHYSICAL SECURITY.  No actions are required of the contractor.  Physical security of the installation site at Daniel Quiros Oduber International Airport is provided by the Costa Rican National Police.<BR><BR>C.1.5.	QUALITY CONTROL.<BR><BR>C.1.5.1.	The contractor shall establish and maintain a complete Quality Control Plan to ensure that the requirements of the contract are provided as specified.  One copy of the contractors Quality Control Plan shall be provided to the contracting officer not later than the pre-performance conference.  An updated copy must be provided to the contracting officer on the contract start date and as changes occur.<BR><BR>C.1.5.2.	The plan shall describe the methods for identifying and preventing defects before the level of performance becomes unacceptable.<BR><BR>C.1.6.	QUALITY ASSURANCE.  The government will evaluate the contractors performance under this contract using the method of surveillance specified in the Technical Exhibit.  All surveillance observations will be recorded by the government.  When an observation indicates defective performance, the COR will obtain the contractors representatives initials on the record of the observation.<BR><BR>C.1.6.1.	Performance Evaluation Meetings.  The contract manager may be required to meet initially with the COR and contracting officer at the beginning of contract performance.  Other meetings will be scheduled as needed.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAIDs Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their countrys political process.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the offices programmatic goals and objectives.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAIDs Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their countrys political process.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the offices programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

The Offeror shall discuss both similarities and differences between this proposed effort and the five referenced contracts.  It will be the only chance the Offeror will have to describe any difficulties, issues and/or accomplishments with the referenced contract.  From this information, the Government will determine the overall risk assessment regarding the Offerors likelihood of success on the proposed project.  If the Offeror does not have five references, the Government will evaluate the references provided.  The Offerors score will be deducted by 4 points per reference less than 5. 

Award will be made to the best value offeror considering price and other factors, e.g., past performance and quality.  The Government will issue one award resulting from this synopsis/solicitation.  Offers not pricing all line items will not be considered for award as this is being acquired on an all or none basis.

<p>Answer 42: Yes</p>
<p>Question 43: .040 exterior aluminum skin has been specified, for a unit of this height, .050 is recommended. .040 is a proper upgrade to the standard .030; however, in sheets this tall it tends to show buckling.</p>

4 March 2008
Urgent Information concerning the Advanced Technical Exploitation Program (ATEP)follows:   Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) is not recognizing ATEP'ssolicitation number of FA8633-08-R-2560. Consequently, the 29 Feb 08 PIXS post toATEP did not post on FBO under said solicitation number. After numerous attemptsby PIXS and FBO administrators to resolve the issue, both concluded the onlysolution is to reissue ATEP information under a new solicitation number.Therefore to ensure you receive any and all updates to the ATEP, you must register/re-register under the new solicitation number of FA8633-08-R-2599. The name of theprogram has not changed, it is still the Advanced Technical Exploitation Program(ATEP).

Additionally, the 29 Feb 08 PIXS posting issuing a new sources sought synopsis isalso attached.   That posting issued a suspense date of 1500 local, 14 Mar 08 forsubmittal of capability statements.  Due to the posting difficulties, a new suspense date of 1500 local, 18 Mar 08 is established. There are no other changes to the requirements for submittals.

<DESC>The US Department of Education is now seeking proposals in response to the 2009 Small Business Innovative Research Fast-Track Program solicitation (attached hereto).  A Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Fast-Track proposal is a single proposal that contains both Phase I and Phase II activities. Through the Fast-Track (Phase I & II) option, the Department of Education intends to fund proposals that have high potential for the commercialization of technologically innovative products that contribute to improved student learning and academic achievement in the field of education.  Participation is encouraged from firms with strong research or research and development (R/R&D) capabilities in the following priority areas:

Priority 1: Education Technology Products for Students
Priority 2: Education Technology Products for Teachers
Priority 3: Education Technology Products for School Administrators

By providing the opportunity to concurrently submit and review a proposal that contains both Phase I and Phase II activities, the Fast-Track option has the potential to minimize any funding gap between the Phase I and Phase II periods.  In order to apply for Fast-Track funding, offerors must submit a full Fast-Track proposal. A Fast-Track Technical Evaluation Review Panel will evaluate all eligible Fast-Track proposals. The Fast-Track proposal will receive a single rating for the proposed Phase I and Phase II project.

Please review the attached solicitation and comply with its requirements when submitting your proposal.

All the fee machine areas listed are in Death Valley.  There are no machines on the west side of the park in Panamint Valley.  Park maps are available at www.nps.gov/deva.  Death Valley National Park is a remote area.  Weather conditions in the park are extreme.  These conditions include sand, heat, rain, wind, and snow to name a few.  Average rainfall is 2 inches per a year.  Heat in July and August can average 121 degrees.
SIGNS:Signs are needed so visitors know where to pay.  The majority of national parks have entrance stations so visitors may not know what the machine standing in front of them is for or if they have an entrance pass already do they need to pay again ( if they already have an Interagency or Death Valley National Park Annual Pass they may proceed to one of the ranger contact stations).  Visitors will need to know how much to pay unless the screen on the machine walks the visitor through the process [i.e., single vehicle $20.00, individual on motorcycle, foot, or bicycle $10.00, commercial tour fees 1-6 seating capacity $25.00 + $10.00 per a person, 7-15 seating capacity $75.00, 16- 25 seating capacity $100.00, 26 or more seating capacity $200.00)].  You may need a sign providing directions on how to use the machine unless the machine walks you through the process on the screen. Many of the visitors may not have computer skills or may not be able to read English well (we have visitors from all over the world).   
CURRENT AUTOMATED FEE MACHINE LOCATIONS WITH POWER:Stovepipe Wells Ranger Station and Stovepipe Wells Campground machinesOne machine at Sunset Campground- next to the accessible sitesFurnace Creek Visitor Center and CampgroundGrapevine Ranger Station
MACHINE LOCATIONS CLOSE TO AN EXISTING PHONE LINE (phone lines may or may not be available due to remoteness):*One pay phone at Texas Springs CampgroundStovepipe Wells Ranger Station Grapevine Ranger StationFurnace Creek Visitor Center*One pay phone at Furnace Creek Campground*One pay phone at Sunset Campground by machine with power*One pay phone at Emigrant Ranger Station*One pay phone at Ryan Junction
*The pay phones are not managed by the Death Valley National Park.
There is one cell phone tower that works in very few locations.  Cell coverage only works with phones that are analog.  
ROAD CLOSURE POSSIBILITIES:Possible road closures due to natural causes can vary in length from a couple of hours to several weeks depending on conditions.  We have snow and rain in Death Valley National Park (on average we receive 2 inches of rain a year).  Road construction may close a road for 8 hours a day for two weeks because a contractor is replacing water lines to private property inside the park or the State is repairing the roadway.  These are all items that may take place and are not necessarily under the control of the National Park Service.  Flash floods have also been known to occur when there is significant rainfall in the surrounding mountains.  This can wipe out a roadway and may involve rebuilding of the road. INTERAGENCY AND ANNUAL PARK PASSES:Sales of Interagency Passes will not be available through the machines.  These may be purchased at any of the ranger contact stations in Death Valley National Park.  Visitors who have an Interagency Annual, Senior, Access, or Death Valley Annual Pass can proceed to the nearest ranger contact station, show their pass and identification, receive a park map and sticker to place in the vehicle windshield (the window sticker lets our rangers know that the visitor has paid an entrance fee).  
MAXIMUM ERROR RATE (MER):The closing tapes from the machines showing the amount of revenue collected from that machine should equal the final amount deposited into the park account.  If any refunds are issued to visitors, they should be documented and supplied with the closing tapes to show accountability for the funds collected.  If the funds collected do not match the amount paid to the park then an error has occurred.  The maximum error rate is one per quarter or four per year with no penalty. 
80% CAPACITY OF FUNDS COLLECTED IN EACH AUTOMATED FEE MACHINE:The removal of funds collected in each automated fee machine by the contractor should occur on a regular basis to keep the automated fee machines from reaching capacity thus rendering them inactive for visitor use.  This would refer to total funds in the machine at any one time (both bills and change making canisters).  
DISTANCES TO MACHINES (from the Furnace Creek area):Ryans Junction  11 miles Zabriskie Point  5 milesBadwater - 18 milesFurnace Creek Visitor Center - 0 milesFurnace Creek Campground  1 mileStovepipe Wells Campground - 25 milesStovepipe Wells Ranger Station  25 milesMesquite Springs Campground  48 milesGrapevine Ranger Station  49 milesTexas Springs Campground  2 milesSunset Campground - 1.5 milesHells Gate  22 miles
The Federal Land Agencies including the National Park Service operate under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) of December 2004.  FLREA information can be found on the following website http://www.doi.gov/ .
Death Valley National Park will need information on sales in the following categories for deposit purposes (these are known as primary work elements):1)  Individual and Vehicle Fees 2)  Commercial Tour Fees3)  Camping Fees
Current fee structure is a monthly payment of fees collected by the contractor and then Death Valley National Park pays the contractor their percentage of the revenue.
Since we do not have entrance stations on all roads coming into Death Valley National Park we are looking for innovative ways to collect entrance and campground fees.  The current compliance shows that between 35% to 40% of visitors pay their entrance fees.  Under the current fee legislation, FLREA, the parks are mandated to bring their total cost of collection to 18% or less of the total revenues collected.

<SUBJECT>Construction of a New United States Land Port of Entry at Alexandria Bay, New York, NY

<RESPDATE>011409
<CONTACT>Winnie W Eng, Contracting Officer, Phone 212-264-2575, Fax 212-264-0588, Email winnie.eng@gsa.gov
<DESC>Solicitation No.: GS-02P-08-DTC-0011(N), Project No.: NNY04001

The Public Buildings Service of the United States General Services Administration (GSA), Northeast & Caribbean Region, New York, NY, announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in providing construction services for a New US Land Port of Entry at Alexandria Bay, NY. The address of the project is 46735 Interstate 81, Alexandria Bay, NY 13607. With this notice, the Government is releasing the Request for Proposals (RFP).

The selected General Contractor (GC) will be required to supply all labor, materials and supervision to perform the complete services as will be required by the resultant contract. The Estimated Construction Cost for this project ranges from $130,000,000 to $150,000,000. The current Alexandria Bay Land Port of Entry was constructed in the early 1970s and no longer meets the traffic volumes or mission needs of the tenant agencies. The port is located on the northern end of Interstate 81 on Wellesley Island in the Thousand Islands Region of New York State. Tenant agencies of the facility are Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Food and Drug Administration, USDA-APHIS Veterinary Services, and GSA. The project includes complete replacement of the existing facility with the construction of 98,275 gsf of buildings including a new administration building, seven (7) new non-commercial inspection lanes, a new non-commercial secondary inspection building, a new commercial building, seven (7) new primary commercial inspection lanes (split level booths that can be used for cars also), two (2) new non-intrusive inspection buildings, eight (8) secondary commercial dock bays, and a new veterinary services building. This project will expand the existing site significantly. The new facility area will increase from approximately 10 acres to approximately 35 acres. A new circulation pattern throughout the facility will increase queuing and will allow safe and secure processing of current and future increased traffic volume entering from Canada. Additionally, future expandability and flexibility will be integrated in the facility design. Significant quantities of rock removal are required in order to develop the site. The construction of this project will take place around the existing port of entry operations which will be a continuous 24 hours, 7 days a week effort. 

This acquisition process will include two (2) Stages. Under Stage 1 of this acquisition, offerors will be required to submit technical and price proposals in accordance with the attached RFP. It is the Governments intention that at the conclusion of Stage 1, up to three (3) offerors will be issued purchase orders to provide design review and related services that they will accomplish during Stage 2. Only the offerors receiving purchase orders for design review services will progress to Stage 2 of this acquisition. Stage 2 of the Acquisition Process will progress as the Architect-Engineer firm (A/E) designs the construction documents (specifications and drawings) for this project. At the conclusion of Stage 2 and based upon technical and price proposal evaluation the Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract to one (1) of the three (3) remaining offerors. The offeror selected at the conclusion of Stage 2 will provide the construction services for the new port of entry. Contract awards are based upon the availability of Government funding. 

Interested offerors are STRONGLY encouraged to register on this site to receive notifications of actions associated with this solicitation number. Solicitation provisions, required proposal forms, clauses and instructions to offerors will be included with the project documents. 

PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE

A Pre-Proposal Conference will NOT be held for Stage 1 of this procurement. However, it is anticipated that a walk-thru of the site will be held during the week of January 5, 2009. The date and time will be confirmed shortly and posted to the FedBizOpps.

It is anticipated that this contract will be awarded by June 2009. This announcement may result in multiple awards and is open to all businesses regardless of size. If concurrent multiple contract awards are made, task orders will be allocated based upon the Contracting Officer's determination of the special qualifications of the firms; the nature of the work involved in the task order; and the immediacy of the work and availability of the firm. Distribution of the work will be a secondary consideration. In the final selection process, the most highly qualified firms may be interviewed. All interested A -E firms are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent, consistent with the efficient performance of the contract, with small and small disadvantaged firms. If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The target subcontracting goals for this contract are as follows: a minimum of 23% of the contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses, 5% be placed with small disadvantaged businesses, 5% be placed with women-owned small businesses, 3.1% be placed with HUB Zone small business, and 1.5% be placed with Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business. Large business firms that intend to do any subcontracting must convey their intent to meet the minimum goals on the SF330. If a large business firm is selected for this contract, it will be required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan during contract negotiations. If the selected firm intends to submit a plan with lesser goals, it must submit written rationale in the plan as to why the above goals cannot be met. The North American Industry Classification System code for this action is 541330 and the small business size standard is $4 million in average annual receipts. This contract will have a base period not to exceed one year and four one-year option periods, for a total IDIQ value not to exceed $12,000,000.

Work under this contract is subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders. Work will be ordered by negotiated firm-fixed price task orders. The District may award in the future IDIQ contracts to perform work that may also be encompassed by this announcement; the Contracting Officer will consider the following factors in deciding which contractor will be selected to negotiate an order: Performance, capacity to accomplish the task order in the required time, specialized experience, professional qualifications and knowledge of the region. If more than one firm is selected, the top ranked firm will be awarded the first contract, the second ranked firm will be awarded the second contract, and so on. If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tie breaker between firms considered as technically equal. The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under this contract must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act.

Jordan  Smart Card Technology.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance related to the introduction of a national Smart Card.

Jordan has adopted a comprehensive Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector modernization as a principle agent for national transformation and development.  In March 2008, the Ministry of Interior (MOI) issued a Request for Information for a National Smart Card system, whereby interested companies describe their technologies, qualifications and solutions in a formal document to the ministry.  This is a way for MOI to learn more about the market and the state of technology.  MOI has been making concrete steps toward the implementation of the Smart Card Technology; however, it would benefit greatly from technically sound advice and recommendations to successfully implement this very complicated project.  The Technical Assistance consultant would assist the Government of Jordan in defining the strategy for the implementation of the Smart Card, identifying the governments needs, and determining how to shape the procurement.  MOI has planned to implement the Smart Card technology in three phases.  The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) funding would support the implementation of the first phase, which would include the national identity card, voting application, health insurance card, drug dispensing card, and an electronic authentication for online government services.  Phases two and three would expand the Smart Card to other areas that have not yet been formally defined. 

Jordans Smart Card project is a stated national priority project that has the personal support of the King, the Royal Court, the National Security and Crisis Management Center and the national government.  Through the implementation of the Smart Card project, Jordan seeks to stimulate and catalyze electronic transactions throughout the Jordanian government and economy.  The Smart Card system is intended as a centerpiece of Jordans overall e-government program.  Since Jordan is in the information gathering stage of the procurement process, it is precisely at this time that the government requires technical and management assistance to bring the project to fruition.  This project represents an opportunity for USTDA to make a significant impact on an important initiative.

The grant was signed by the Minister of Planning and International Cooperation on behalf of MOI.  While MOI is the primary implementing body, it is advised closely by the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology.

The study includes: an internal needs assessment; development of a Smartcard National Strategy Framework; risk analysis; identification of potential funding; legal and regulatory analysis; identification of vendor evaluation criteria; support of Request for Proposals document; detailed financial and economic analysis; a preliminary environmental impact assessment; and a development benefit assessment.  The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $410,083 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by January 26, 2009 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>Please note that this is NOT a request for SF330's or proposals, the Government is seeking information for market research purposes only. The Government may or may not issue a Request for Proposal. The VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care Center, Biloxi, MS, is conducting a market survey for qualified small businesses that are Veteran-owned (VOSB) or Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVOSB) located within a 250 mile radius of the VAGCVHCS located at 400 Veterans Avenue, Biloxi, MS.  If there are enough responses of interest to this notice the Request for Proposal will be issued as a 100% set-aside for SDVOSB or VOSB.  Look for any further information in FedBizOpps.  Applicable NAICS code is 541310 size standard $4.5 million. Responses to this notice must be submitted in writing (email or fax is acceptable) and received no later than December 12th, 2008. NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES will be accepted. All responses to this notice must indentify the social economic category of the respondent, name and address of company, name and phone number of contact person, and must also include the company's DUNS number.  Description of the work to be performed includes:Provide professional Architect/Engineer (A/E) Services to include preliminary services,  investigative work, planning consultations and visits, design work, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, preparation of bid items, and if necessary, respond to contractor's and subcontractor's inquiries during the bid period, preparation of as-built drawings, preparation of cost estimates, and construction period services as necessary for construction administration and installation of all work for Project No. 520-324.  There will be three (3) submissions for working drawings and specification; 25%, 75%, and 100% design submissions.  This project consists of a complete renovation of Surgery and ICU 4th Floor of Building 3.  Included will be minor floor space reallocation, significant infrastructure/utility upgrades, and upgrading of interior finishes.  All areas will be updated to meet the latest VA requirements for modernization.  This includes rehabilitation of walls, floors, ceilings, doorways, and restrooms.  Remodeling in some areas to meet new space criteria and increase space utilization.  Updating environmental controls and equipment such as ventilation fans, air handling equipment, and air distribution.  NOTE: No major space changes will be performed resulting in a lower per square foor renovation cost.The existing infrastructure is over 25 years old and does not meet current Surgery/ICU needs or design criteria.  This includes room sizes, and configuration features and criteria for Surgery and ICU.  Potential code issues related to JCAHO, SOARS, CAP, and other required review agencies will be addressed and resolved with this project.  Currently we do meet the air change and air flow requirements in all surgery suites; however, once the rooms are brought up to standard size, this may not be the case.  With the system we currently have, we are unable to compensate or make adjustments to meet the latest requirements without significantly impacting daily operations.  We intend to use this project as an opportunity to make the necessary upgrades that will allow us to monitor and maintain the air quality requirements at all times.  In addition, we intend to modernize Surgery and ICU by upgrading finishes and utilities serving these areas.  The Surgical Service design will follow Department of Veterans Affairs Design Guide dated August 2005 for Surgical Service templates located at http://vaww.va.gov/facmgt/standard/dg_surg.asp.  Interior construction will meet all required codes and standards.  It is anticipated that the project will be designed with vinyl, carpet, and rubber flooring, painted gypsum wallboard system, acoustical ceiling grid systems (except wet areas), corner guards and handrails throughout hallways, and other standard medical clinic interior finishes.  The A/E will prepare a proposed color chart with all finishes for approval by VA Interior Design staff.The design includes all mechanical and electrical systems.  Plumbing will include sanitary, hot, and cold water systems.  It is not anticipated to include any medical piping.  The HVAC system will include zoned air handlers, variable air boxes, etc. all controlled by a central computer system.  The electrical system consists of standard electrical devices (220/120V) and low-voltage systems.  The low-voltage systems will include CAT5 data and phone, nurse call, panic alarms, fire alarms, security entrance systems, etc.  The project design shall be completed in accordance with the scope of work and all appropriate Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Standards, specifications, and other criteria unless otherwise approved by VA.  The design shall be reviewed and approved by a Registered Fire Protection engineer.  The following references, as a minimum, shall be utilized for planning and design purposes: 	H-08-1, VA Master Construction Specifications	H-08-3, VA Construction Standards	H-08-4, VA Standard Details	NFPA, EPA, OSHA, and all applicable local, state, and Federal regulationsUpon completion of the construction, A/E shall obtain from the construction contractor a marked-up set of drawings incorporating "as-built" conditions.  A/E shall submit one (1) set of Mylar sepia "as-builts" (each drawing shall be stamped "AS-BUILT" in red ink), and shall submit computer generated material depicting as-built conditions in accordance with all applicable VA Engineering CADD requirements.  A/E shall submit final "as-built" diskettes to VA Engineering in AutoCad 2004 (or better).All design submissions are subject to Department of Veterans Affairs review.
