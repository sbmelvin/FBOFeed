<DESC>PM Soldier Equipment  Technical Management Division (TMD) has a requirement for the testing and evaluation of blunt and blast injury biomechanics. A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), three year indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract is anticipated. The Government intends to procure under NAICS 541712 with a small business size standard of $7 million. The nature and details of injury resulting from behind armor blunt trauma and blast events is still unknown. The ability of TMD to develop personal protection equipment (PPE) for effective mitigation of the various injury mechanisms is contingent upon a full and complete understanding of blunt and blast injury biomechanics. Anthropometric test devices (ATD) are novel tools for the testing and evaluation of PPE. The services of a scientist or engineer, with technical support, are required to develop experimental protocol and guide testing of these parameters. This work cannot be completed in house because of the equipment availability and cost. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.<BR>Award will be made to the best value proposal, which is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government. The official release of the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on the internet at the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website located at the following address: https://acquisition.army.mil. The on-line version of the RFP will include all documents of the solicitation package. Amendments, if any, will be posted at the same location as the solicitation. The complete solicitation package, including amendments should be received and reviewed prior to submitting response. It is the responsibility of those responding to the solicitation to obtain all amendments and/or other applicable documents. It is anticipated that this solicitation will be issued on or around 5 February 2010. Ashley Klapka is the point of contact for this action, email: ashley.klapka@us.army.mil. All questions to this solicitation shall be submitted in writing and emailed to the above listed address. Please hold all questions until the solicitation has been issued.<BR>

ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS:  Beverage (soda) Distribution Services  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's fore  most federally funded biomedical research institution.  NIH   is comprised of twenty-seven Institutes, Centers, and Divisi  ons.  The Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (CRC) is   the onsite hospital for the NIH campus, providing full supp  ort for clinical research in inpatient and outpatient settin  gs.  The 870,000 square foot complex consists of 242 inpatie  nt beds and 90 day hospital stations.  The CRC connects to t  he existing Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center.  Together  , the Magnuson and Hatfield centers form the NIH Clinical Ce  nter, the worlds largest clinical research complex serving a   dual role; providing humane and healing patient care as wel  l as the environment clinical researchers need to advance cl  inical science.       The Nutrition Department provides the best possible patient   care and research support for patients of the NIH Clinical C  enter.  The Nutrition Department provides food to patients u  ndergoing treatment at the NIH Clinical Center as well as nu  trition assessments, counseling services, and enteral and pa  renteral feeding recommendations by Registered Dietitians.       The NIH is soliciting Beverage (soda) Distribution Services   to provide 8oz cans of soda for patient's meals while underg  oing research/treatment.  Clinical Center patients, whether   on an inpatient unit, a day hospital bed or in the outpatien  t clinics are offered meals and nourishments to meet individ  ualized need.  Due to the many fluid restrictions for numero  us diet types, 8oz cans are required.       The Distributor will provide the NIH Clinical Center with th  e necessary sodas (8oz size only) within the prescribed time  frames in order to provide meals to patients undergoing rese  arch/treatment in the CRC.       A state-of-the-art integrated food management computer syste  m CBORD allows the service of regular and therapeutic diets,   as well as diets for research protocols. CBORD is populated   with all food/products/nourishments that are provided to pa  tients undergoing research/treatment in the CRC.  Every food   item/product/nourishment undergoes a comprehensive review b  y a Registered Dietitian before it can be added to the datab  ase, included on the room service menu and served to a patie  nt.  These reviews are conducted on an ongoing basis to ensu  re that the Nutrition Department is in compliance with all r  egulatory requirements (FDA, JCAHO, etc) for safe patient ca  re.     Because patients being followed at the NIH Clinical Center a  re undergoing research, the Nutrition Department must not on  ly ensure that patients receive the best nutritional care bu  t also they must ensure the integrity of research protocols   related to nutrition.  Therefore, the contractor must provid  e the nutritional ingredients and nutrient values of the sod  as.  If the vendor currently does not stock the products req  uested in the current inventory they can provide their capab  ility to add it to their inventory and the proposed cost.    Period of Performance:  The period performance shall be for   1 year from the date of award with 4 additional successive 1  2 month option periods based on the need for the service.      The Contractor must have a valid DUNS number and be register   in the Central Contract Registerar (CCR) database with an a  ctive status, to be eligible for award before award.     The delivery schedule for the 8 oz sodas will be order as ne  eded.     Please include the following information in your proposals:     Solicitation number  Nutritional Content for each soda type  Sodium levels  Cost per case (include the number of 8 oz cans in each case)  How much notice is required in order to meet our delivery da  te.     Submit your proposals by January 25, 2010 and all questions   electronically to Deborah Culpepper, dculpepper@cc.nih.gov.    No telephone calls please     In any case, the government reserves the right to make an aw  ard to that offer or whose proposal provides the best overal  l value to the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTERS 2009 TASK ORDER CONTRACTORS.

Federal Health Information Technology (HIT) Strategic Plan Support 

Section 3001(c)(3) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), signed into law on February 17, 2009, requires the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (HIT), in coordination with other appropriate Federal agencies, to update the Federal HIT Strategic Plan (the Strategic Plan) developed as of June 3, 2008.

The successful Contractor is required to assist with the coordination of the Strategic Plan in coordination with other appropriate Federal agencies on the behalf of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.  This Plan was last updated on June 3, 2008.

By statute, the Strategic Plan must be updated through collaboration of public and private entities, include measurable outcome goals, and include specific objectives, milestones, and metrics with respect to the following:
•	The electronic exchange and use of health information and the enterprise integration of such information.
•	The utilization of an electronic health record for each person in the United States by 2014.
•	The incorporation of privacy and security protections for electronic exchange of an individual’s individually identifiable health information.
•	Ensuring security methods to ensure appropriate authorization and electronic authentication of health information and specifying technologies or methodologies for rendering health information unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable.
•	Specifying a framework for coordination and flow of recommendations and policies under this subtitle among the Secretary, the National Coordinator, the HIT Policy Committee, the HIT Standards Committee, and other health information exchanges and other relevant entities.
•	Methods to foster the public understanding of health information technology.
•	Strategies to enhance the use of health information technology in improving the quality of health care, reducing medical errors, reducing health disparities, improving public health, increasing prevention and coordination with community resources, and improving the continuity of care among health care settings. 
•	Specific plans for ensuring that populations with unique needs, such as children, are appropriately addressed in the technology design, as appropriate, which may include technology that automates enrollment and retention for eligible individuals.

The Strategic Plan will cover the period 2011 through 2015.  The Strategic Plan will primarily emphasize the implementation of legislative imperatives to achieve widespread meaningful use of HIT.  It will also focus on laying the ground work for the period beyond 2015 when the power of widely disseminated electronic health information exchange can be applied to enhanced uses not now emphasized in the meaningful use matrix.   Ultimately, the Strategic Plan must create a pathway toward a learning health care system that improves system performance, population and individual health.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be issuing an Invitation for Bid for Maintenance Dredging.  The proposed work consists of maintenance dredging of the 15-foot Federal entrance channel at Newburyport Harbor.  The work consists of dredging about 160,000 cubic yards (cy) of sand to a required depth of 16 feet, plus a 1-foot overdepth allowance to 17 feet.  About 120,000 cy will be placed on Plum Island Beach in Newbury, about 1  miles away; and disposal of about 40,000 cy will be on Salisbury Beach in Salisbury, about 1  miles away.  The dredged material can be removed using either an ocean-certified cutterhead pipeline dredge or an ocean-certified hopper dredge with pump-out capability.

The new dune face would be planted with grass and sand fencing installed.  Dredging and disposal window is from September 1 to March 31.  Dredging operations will be permitted 24 hours per day and 7 days per week.  The entrance channel was last dredged in 1999 when approximately 145,000 cy were removed.  The estimated cost of this procurement is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. A pre-bid conference will be held at the New England District, Concord, MA and is currently scheduled for Tuesday, February 16, 2010 at 10:00 am in the New England Conference Room.

<DESC>The Air Force is seeking sources for a potential 100 percent set-aside for certified 8(a) program participants, HUBZone or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns. This is a sources sought for planning purposes only. <br />
<p><br />The purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to obtain information from potential eligible contractors for an Airfield Pavement and Basewide Marking Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. IF ADEQUATE RESPONSES ARE NOT RECEIVED, THE ACQUISTION MAY BE SOLICIATED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS.</p>
<p>The Airfield Pavement and Basewide Marking IDIQ contract at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, will be a firm-fixed price contract. NAICS Code 237310, Size Standard $33.5 Million. The period of performance is expected to be one (1) twelve (12) month base contract period, with two (2) twelve (12) month option periods. The estimated magnitude for the entire contract is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.</p>
<p>Project Description: Aircraft and vehicular traffic cause pavement markings to crack, peel, and fade over time, resulting in the need for periodic maintenance (painting overlay or paint removal and repainting). Aircraft landings cause a build-up of tire rubber. In one year of normal airfield operations, the rubber build-up covers existing pavement markings causing a safety problem for landing aircraft. The rubber needs to be removed a minimum of once a year and the markings repainted. Heavy usage would require removal and repainting twice a year. Salt applications and snow removal on the airfield and roadways also cause deteriorated pavement markings; snow plows degrade and damage the reflective beads on the pavement markings. Satisfactory markings are required to enhance safety on both roads and airfield pavements. This project reapplies markings on both road and airfield pavements and removes marking as required.</p>
<p>Prime contractors who are certified 8(a) program participants, HUBZone or SDVOSB and who intend to submit a bid for this solicitation MUST submit the following by 12:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on 27 JAN 2010.</p>

<p>(4) documentation of SDVOSB status;</p>
<p>(5) listing of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact with their phone numbers, and an explanation of the relevancy of the project;</p>
<p>(6) documentation from surety or their agent of your capability to be bonded for bid, performance and payment bonds for this project;</p>
<p>(7) If you are a HUBZone considering a joint venture that has not been formalized, you will need to specify the firm(s) you intend to partner with and how you plan to officially form the joint venture.</p>
<p>Firms interested should provide the above documentation by email (preferred) or fax. All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on the availability of interested certified 8(a) program participants, HUBZone or SDVOSB concerns. Responses shall be limited to 10 pages. Please include your DUNS number and your CAGE code.

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command, Rock Island Contracting Center, Rock Island, IL on behalf of the Office of the Project Director Joint Products, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources that are capable of manufacturing FMU-143 Fuzes for use by the United States Air Force and United States Navy.<BR><BR>CONTRACT TYPE:  The Government anticipates soliciting offers for award of a single Firm Fixed Price Contract with a base year and four (4) options to deliver the United States Air Force FMU-143 Fuze production requirements for FY10-FY14.   Potential contractors possessing the technical, financial and facility resources necessary to meet the Governments requirements will initially awarded a firm fixed price contract with a CLIN for a separately priced First Article Acceptance Test (FAAT).  The Government intends to evaluate the requested proposals using Best Value Procedures including the following factors: Quality Management System, Technical Plan Factors and Ratings, Past Performance Factor Ratings, and Utilization of Small Businesses as subcontractors.<BR><BR>ITEM DESCRIPTION:  The FMU-143 has approximately 19 different configurations from the FMU-143 B/B (the base configuration) through FMU-143 T/B.  The Government desires one unit price for all configurations. These diverse configurations currently exist for two reasons: 1) Navy Safety requirement differ from Air Force requirements, and 2) Different delay timings in arming and impact delay times, booster material, and accessories are required for different theatre targets.  To comply with safety the Navy uses PBXN-7.  NOTE: The Air Force uses COMP A5.  Different Arming timings are achieved by making minor changes in the electronic componentry; this request is for all configurations of the FMU-143 Fuze.  The technical data package for the FMU-143B/B, NSN 1325-01-323-9171, drawing number 8983300, will be modified and/or appended to delineate specifications for the variants being purchased.  <BR><BR>GENERAL DESCRIPTION: The FMU-143 fuzing system consist of five major components:  1) FMU-143 Fuze; 2) FZU-32 Bomb Fuze Initiator;  3) Cable Assembly;  4) Aft Fuze Mounting Retainer; and 5) Swivel and Clip Assembly.  These five components are designed to work together to provide one-time fuzing and initiation when installed on penetrating warheads.  The FMU-143 bomb fuze is powered by the air-driven FZU-32 bomb fuze initiator through the cable assembly.  The aft fuze-mounting retainer secures the bomb fuze within the aft fuze well. The swivel and clip assembly connects the fuze lanyard to the aft bomb rack solenoid.  Lanyard pull at bomb release results in fuze activation.<BR><BR>EXPORT RESTRICTIONS:  All respondents to this market survey should show they have certification to receive export-controlled technical data (including drawings restricted by Distributions Statement D) and must have facilities with sufficient safety clearance to handle hazard classifications (i.e. 1.3G).

Background
The Foreign Service Institute (FSI) provides training and professional development to personnel of the Department of State and the Foreign Service community. In relation to this, FSI’s Leadership and Management School conducts relevant, cutting-edge leadership and management training programs which address career development and training needs of Department employees from entry level through the senior ranks. One of these programs addresses the topic of employee relations for Department supervisors and managers. 

Purpose of this Solicitation
The Foreign Service Institute is actively seeking one or more contractors to perform a variety of training activities related to the topic of employee relations, either as regularly scheduled courses or occasional, intermittent activities. The purpose of the training is to help supervisors gain knowledge, skills and confidence in their abilities to handle employee conduct and performance problems within official guidelines.  The learning objectives of this training for the participants are to:
•	Interpret and apply the State Department and US government rules and regulations governing performance, conduct problems and leave issues.

FSI intends to issue task orders under this solicitation to develop employee relations training programs; deliver employee relations training courses and modules; conduct and analyze needs assessments, surveys and/or course evaluations; design training tools and instruments; present as subject matter experts; and write student course and reference materials

No part of the services to be performed under this agreement may be subcontracted, and no obligation or duty arising out of the individual order may be transferred, or assigned, without the prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. Orders will be issued under this BPA based upon the government's need and according to FSI's determination of what is most advantageous to the Government. FSI does not guarantee any minimum level of work under any resultant BPA.

The Forest Service and the Department of Interior intend to issue solicitations for the following equipment/services in 2010, to obtain resources for preseason incident agreements (EERAs).  Rather than the agencies setting the price, this method requires vendors to compete by providing a price, as well as personnel and equipment information for consideration.  In order to receive an EERA for these categories of equipment/services, vendors must respond to the solicitations when they are issued.  Only one award nationally will be made for any piece of equipment or service within a category. The EERAs that are issued will be for a period of 3 years.  There will not be another opportunity to sign up these types of equipment/services until the end of the three year period.

2010:
*  Water Handling Equipment (including Engines, Support Water Tenders, and Tactical Water Tenders)

*  Heavy Equipment with Water (including Pumper Cats, Skidgines, and Softtracks)
Refrigerator Trailers

*  Bus, Crew Carrier

Note:  The attached Competitive Solicitation Plan (see attached PDF) details the Forest Services’ National Plan for issuing competitive preseason incident agreements in future years.  Please see this attachment for additional information.

Standard specifications are being developed in an effort to increase consistency.    The solicitations will only be available online; they will not be mailed out hardcopy.  It is expected that solicitations will be issued on a geographic basis throughout the fall/winter months. They will be available at the following website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov), so please visit this website to become familiar with it.  In addition, you please visit the following website to obtain additional information on becoming a contractor for Incidents http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php#interested

<DESC>A successful manufacturer of seals shall be capable of producing anti-pilferage seals with the minimum general requirements listed below:

The seal is intended for use on mail containers where security is of utmost importance.  The seal shall secure the mail containers and shall not allow the container to be opened without physical destruction of the seal.  The seal shall be a passive one time use locking device and shall indicate tampering or access into the mail containers.  The seal shall close and lock in a manner that provides an audible and tactile feedback to the user that the seal has closed securely.  When forcibly opened or cut, the seal shall be incapable of being resealed.  The seal shall be protected against "picking", i.e., to unlock and re-close the seal without evidence of tampering.  Any attempt to open the seal should be readily detectable.

Each seal shall bear a printed barcode that encodes its unique sequential serial number.  The barcode shall match an eight (8) digit identification number embossed on the seal.  The barcode shall be compatible with USPS scanners and utilize one of the following barcode symbologies (to be specified in the future):  GS1-128; ISS Code 128; DataMatrix; PDF-417; Interleaved 2-of-5 (I 2-of-5); or Code 39.  At least 70 percent of the barcodes in each shipment of seals shall have an overall symbol grade of "B" or better.  The remainder shall measure no less than a symbol grade of "C".  Specified symbol grades are based upon the ISO/IEC 15416 Barode Print Quality Guideline (formerly INCITS 182) which recommends a method of measuring the quality parameters of printed barcode symbols.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard Surface Forces Logistics Center has a requirement to repair/overhaul Starters (See attachment Overhaul Descriptions) in support of the 110’ WPB class Coast Guard Cutters. The Government will allow competitive offers to be submitted for this repair; however, all repairs must be done in accordance with OEM Standards and Specifications using ONLY new, genuine Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) parts. Remanufactured and aftermarket parts are not acceptable. It is anticipated that a firm, fixed priced, 5 year Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) will be awarded to Robert Bosch GMBH, or their authorized facilities for these repairs. It is the Government’s belief that only Robert Bosch GMBH, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), have the required technical, engineering specifications, and drawings to effectively repair these starters. Additionally, concerns that have previously been successful in providing certain Robert Bosch starter repairs to the Government are encouraged to quote; along with the quote must be specific evidence showing previous success of repair including contract number, date, NSN and part numbers of pumps, at a minimum. The information required is proprietary to Robert Bosch GMBH. The Government did not procure this information, or the rights to use this information, under the original contract. Therefore, it is the Government’s intention to solicit and negotiate only with Robert Bosch GMBH or concerns as stated above. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to repair the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing the same within 7 calendar days from the day this notice is posted. The information that must be submitted includes: (1) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the capability to repair to OEM standards (2) Data that the facility has satisfactorily repaired these exact pumps for the Government. This data must include sufficient information to allow the Coast Guard to evaluate the information relative to the above requirements. Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate a bona fide capability to meet the requirements. Inquiries/information received after the established deadline shall NOT be considered for this acquisition. The submission of this data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned. The Government does NOT intend to pay for information solicited. This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and HSAM 3006.302-1. For information regarding this acquisition, contact the Contracting officials listed herein.
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.

This is a Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Purchase order to Mclean Contracting Company. This synopsis is issued pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and HSAM 3006-302. A determination was made by the Government to award the service to Mclean Contracting Company with justification using other than full and open competition.

<DESC>This RFI is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation/call for proposals under a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) or an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government will not pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the Government's use of that information. No contract or other instrument will be issued as a result of this RFI. The Electronic Warfare Techniques Development and Analysis Branch of the Senors Directorate, Air Force Research Laboratory, WPAFB OH (AFRL/RYRE) is issuing a request for information (RFI) for new and innovative technologies, techniques, and concepts that will enable development and implementation of a first generation Cognitive Jammer (CJ) system. Candidate technologies/techniques/concepts will be considered for potential funding. However, at this time AFRL is only seeking industry inputs, ideas, and capabilities. If a firm requirement materializes, that requirement will be published in a BAA and formal proposals will be requested.<br />Traditionally countermeasures are categorized as either Radar or Communications. They have limited adaptability and are effective against a pre-determined or well exploited threat. The advent of Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) technologies such as Software Defined Radio (SDR) / Cognitive Radio and its proliferation further challenges the EW community. The objective of the CJ is to promote spectrum dominance by improving the jamming effectiveness while at the same time taking measures to minimize fratricide. CJ is envisioned as an adaptive, multifunctional (communications, radar, navigation and etc.), cross-layered jamming system based on a networked Software Defined Architecture (SDA). This RFI seeks ideas addressing each one of the current limitations and how to fill in those gaps. <br />The Electronic Warfare Techniques Development and Analysis Branch is primarily looking for concepts, techniques and technologies currently at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3+. However, this does not rule out concepts that are less mature. The focus of this RFI is on evolutionary as well as revolutionary ideas which can guide the future CJ laboratory demonstrations, modeling/simulation, and networked SDA demonstration opportunities, with emphasis on flexibility and adaptability.<br />Please provide two copies of your RFI submission to the points of contact listed below, not later than 4 February 2010. An AFRL team will subsequently review all submissions for further consideration. The format of submission is as follows:
<p>1. A brief technical summary (not to exceed five pages) of the program/concept. <br />2. Please provide a single hard and soft copy on a CD/DVD using Microsoft Office products.<br />3. Please do not include commercial literature, brochures, catalogs or sales information.</p>
<p>You may be asked to further present and discuss your concept in person to a government team at Wright Patterson AFB OH during the first quarter of calendar year 2010. <br />The Electronic Warfare Techniques Development and Analysis Branch is currently formulating a potential future program in this area, and again if a requirement materializes, that requirement will be published in a BAA and formal proposals will be asked for at that time. The Electronic Warfare Techniques Development and Analysis Branch is looking for information on both short term and multiyear efforts. If you have technology efforts or concepts you would like to submit for funding consideration, please forward two copies:</p>
<p>the first copy to:<br />Dr. Vasu Chakravarthy and Mr. Cliff Bullmaster <br />AFRL/RYRE<br />2241 Avionics Circle<br />Area B, Bldg. 620<br />Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7022<br />(937) 904-9039<br />Fax: (937) 255-7984<br /><br />the second copy to:<br />Mr. Barry Kain, PCO<br />Det 1 AFRL/PKSR<br />2310 Eighth Street<br />Area B, Bldg 167<br />WPAFB, OH 45433-7801<br />Fax: (937) 255-8100</p>

The Government intends to announce a Request for Project Proposals for execution of project award(s) in support of a Ground Robotics related research area: Cargo UGV.

<DESC>DARPA-SN-10-14 <br />Proposer's Day Workshop Announcement
<p>Transformer (TX)<br />Tactical Technology Office<br />Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</p>
<p><br />The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Workshop in support of a planned Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Transformer (TX) program. The workshop will occur at 0700-1500 EST on January 14, 2010, at Westin Arlington Gateway, 801 North Glebe Road, Arlington, VA 22203.</p>
<p>This Special Notice is issued solely for information and program planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Workshop is intended to introduce to the research community the TX program vision, goals and objectives, and opportunities associated with the development of interdisciplinary teams to respond to an anticipated Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). The workshop does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Attendance at the workshop is voluntary and is not required to propose to any potential related Broad Agency Announcements or potential research solicitations on this topic. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to participate in this workshop.</p>
<p>The objective of the Transformer (TX) program is to demonstrate a 1 to 4 person transportation vehicle that can drive and fly, thus enabling the warfighter to avoid water, difficult terrain, and road obstructions as well as IED and ambush threats. The vehicle will be capable of driving on prepared surface and light off-road conditions, while flight functionality will require Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL). In addition, range and speed efficiencies will allow for tactically relevant missions to be performed on a single tank of fuel. The ability to provide the warfighter a platform that enables terrain-independent mobility would significantly affect how distributed operations are performed today. Current transport systems present operational limitations where the warfighter is either anchored to the ground with HMMWVs and thus vulnerable to ambush, or reliant on helicopters, which are limited in flight speed and availability. TX provides the flexibility to adapt to traditional and asymmetric threats by providing the operator unimpeded movement over difficult terrain. In addition, transportation is no longer restricted to trafficable terrain that tends to makes movement predictable. This enables the warfighter to approach targets from directions opportune to them and not the enemy.</p>
<p>Within the TX program, DARPA seeks to: 1) Develop a robust vehicle design that maximizes military utility at a reasonable cost, 2) Identify and mature the critical enabling technologies necessary to vehicle development, and 3) Build a single prototype vehicle that demonstrates the program goals through ground and flight tests. Technologies relevant to the objectives of the TX program can be found in numerous disciplines and areas of research including: adaptive wing structures, ducted fan propulsion, lightweight composite materials, advanced flight control technology for stable transition from vertical to horizontal flight, hybrid electric drive, advanced batteries, and others.</p>
<p>To facilitate maximum participation DARPA will host a TX Proposers' Day Workshop. The workshop will: (a) Introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the TX program vision and objectives; (b) Explain the mechanics of a DARPA program and the milestones and metrics of this potential effort; and (c) Promote teaming arrangements among organizations having relevant expertise, facilities, and capabilities to execute an interdisciplinary research program responsive to the TX program goals. The workshop will include overview presentations by Government personnel and a poster session to facilitate interaction and team building among the session participants. Potential participants should note that formation of teams with sufficient expertise to address all technical areas is critical. Workshop participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters describing areas of capabilities in order to facilitate discussions during the poster session.</p>
<p>There is no fee to attend the TX Proposers' Day Workshop. Registration for the workshop is limited by the venue capacity. To maximize the number of organizations participating, there is a limit of three persons per organization. Early registration is strongly recommended. The poster session will be limited to 1 poster per organization with a cut-off of 100 posters total. The registration cutoff date is 4:00PM ET, January 7, 2010.</p>
<p>Workshop details including registration, poster session, meeting location, and lodging are provided on the registration website.</p>
<p>Workshop Details: <br />Time: January 14, 2010, 7:00am-3:00pm<br />Location: Westin Arlington Gateway<br />801 North Glebe Road<br />Arlington, VA 22203 <br />(800) 627-7076 (Reservations)<br />(703) 717-6200 (Hotel Operator)<br />Registration Website: http://www.sa-meetings.com/TX2010 (Password = TX2010)</p>

<DESC>Contract No. 70181AM077
TAS: 14 12610000
United States Department of the InteriorJustification of Other than Full and Open Competition Under $25,000
1) Briefly, a description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs and include the estimated value.The Alaska Region of the Fish and Wildlife Service is hosting a conference for all of its managers and supervisors February 8 - 12, 2010, in Anchorage, Alaska.  It has been eight years since the Region had held a similar meeting.  The management and administrative landscape has changed much over the last eight years and added to the mix is the recognition of the impact of global climate change on the world, nation and Alaska.  Most climate scientists agree that the extent and rate of change will be most extreme at or near the poles.  Alaska, much of which in above the Arctic Circle, is experiencing the most dramatic impacts ecologically.  The Service manages nearly 80 million acres of land in Alaska and it managers and supervisors are being challenged now to anticipate, project, and react to this changing environment.  The goal of this Leadership Conference is to develop an unified sense of mission, empower them to push the knowledge envelope, and position the agency and its resources to anticipate and react to the changes that are on the horizon.  
The Conference title is "Challenges of Leading in a Changing Landscape."  To set the stage for this 3-day meeting, we want to have a plenary speaker that challenges our leaders and managers to not be paralyzed in the face of change but to embrace it and lead by example.  We want a speaker that has a breadth of knowledge of how other leaders on the national and international landscape have met similar challenges and proven their leadership and excelled in the face of adversity especially as it relates to managing through times of uncertainty.  We are seeking a plenary speaker that can provide a 45 minute presentation and respond to questions for an additional 15 minutes. We believe that Douglas Brinkley is the only speaker that meets our requirements.
2)  Statutory Authority  permitting other than full and open competition.  Identify the statutory authority permitting with the FAR citation and FAR citation Title.  FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  
3) WHY are the proposed contractor's unique qualifications for the nature of the acquisition requiring the use of the authority cited in item (2). While there are many vendors that speak on leadership, leadership characteristics, and managing change, we believe that Douglas Brinkley is uniquely suited for this task .The late historian Stephen E. Ambrose once called Brinkley "the best of the new generation of American historians.  The Chicago Tribune has called Brinkley "America's new past master", and former President Bill Clinton called him "one of the historians I most admire."  Driven Patriot (1992), a biography of James Forrestal, received the Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt Naval History Prize. Another Brinkley book--FDR and the Creation of the U.N. (1997)--was touted by historian Ernest May and diplomat Richard Holbrooke as "excellent."   Mr. Brinkley also wrote  the comprehensive American Heritage History of the United States (1998), that has been called a "riveting narrative" by the noted historian and videographer Ken Burns.  Walter Cronkite has been attributed is saying it was the "best" one-volume U.S. History book. Brinkley's book, The Unfinished Presidency: Jimmy Carter's Journey Beyond the White House (1999) is widely considered instrumental in the ex-president's winning of the Nobel Peace prize. The Los Angeles Times decided that the 587 page-long Carter biography was an "important history" and an "invaluable resource." Brinkley's epic Wheels for the World: Henry Ford, His Company, and A Century of Progress (2003) won Business Week book of the year. The Wall Street Journal called it "sweeping and absorbing", and Foreign Affairs deemed the work a "tour de force of scholarship that synthesizes a vast amount of material into a comprehensible and readable whole."  Brinkley also had the honor of being selected the official biographer of Rosa Parks, the women that help to breakdown the barriers of institutionalized racism in America.
In January 2006, Brinkley and fellow historian Julie M. Fenster released Parish Priest, a biography of Father Michael J. McGivney, the founder of the Knights of Columbus. Brinkley edited the New York Times best-selling The Reagan Diaries (2007). Walter Pincus, of The Washington Post, wrote that "It's amazing what nuggets of information you can unearth deep within a book as jam-packed as The Reagan Diaries."
Brinkley's The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America was a bestseller in 2009. The New York Times Book Review deemed The Wilderness Warrior a Notable Book of the year and called the tome: "inspiring, and enormously entertaining.... The Wilderness Warrior has Rooseveltian energy. It is largehearted, full of the vitality of its subject and a palpable love for the landscapes it describes." The New Yorker--a periodical which Brinkley frequently wrote for in the 1990s--conceded that in The Wilderness Warrior the author "fully inhabits Roosevelt's mind." 
When Barack Obama was elected the 44th President of the United States Brinkley was asked along with Tom Brokaw and U.S. Representative John Lewis to write an essay for the Official Inaugural Book. He was also invited to the White House in the summer of 2009 to discuss history with the president in a wide-ranging conversation on everything from foreign policy to conservation.
Douglas Brinkley is a student of leadership and has researched its characteristics in many national and internationally recognized leaders from a diminutive black woman who steadfastly refused to give up her seat on a bus to a host of United States Presidents who lead the nation in uncertain times and towards unknown futures.  Mr. Brinkley has studied, distilled, and written books of acknowledged renown on these leaders and their leadership characteristics that is unrivaled in other authors.  Mr. Brinkley's insight into leadership and specifically his insight into the conservation ethos of President Theodore Roosevelt that largely heralded in the age of modern conservation make him uniquely and solely positioned to address the Alaska Region's conference on the "Challenges of Leading in a Changing Landscape."  Mr. Brinkley will be speaking to the group using his historical research on Teddy Roosevelt, and several other past Presidents that has been captured in his books about them and their leadership across decades of American and world history.  His research and books will be used as the basis for developing his presentation on leadership and the common characteristics that allowed them to lead during uncertain times focusing on its implications for conservation leaders. 
Mr. Brinkley to provide our introductory plenary speech to be delivered at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday, February 9, 2010, at the Downtown Hilton  located in Anchorage, Alaska.  The presentation should focus on identifying the leadership characteristics of acknowledged leaders from Rosa Parks to President Bill Clinton focusing on their experiences of leading during uncertain times and emphasizing lessons that can be translated to the conservation challenges we will face in the coming decades.  The presentation will address approximately 150 individuals and should be approximately 45 minutes followed by a approximately 15 minute period where attendees will ask Mr. Brinkley about questions relevant to the topic. We are seeking a speaker that is a student of leadership and one that has specifically analyzed leadership traits specifically in the environmental/conservation arena on a national or global landscape.
4) WHAT effort was made to ensure that offers were solicited from as many potential sources as is practical.  In conducting market research to seek a keynote speaker for the conference, several hours of internet searches were conducted using a variety of key word phrases. The following list provides the key phrases used in the searches: Leadership speakers, Conservation + leadership, Leadership speakers conservation, Speakers conservation leadership, History leadership speakers, Conservation leadership characteristics. The intent was to seek potential speakers that could speak from a standpoint of the historical record about the characteristics of leadership based upon acknowledged political and conservation leaders.  There are scores of speakers who speak on leadership, from a host of perspectives: business, marketing, adventure, etc.  In reviewing speaker websites, none of the potential sources indicated their presentations were based on studies of acknowledged leaders, nor did any suggest that their presentations tie together common leadership characteristics of multiple leaders.  Most presentations seemed to suggest that the speaker was basing their presentations upon personal accomplishments or achievements.
Additionally, the Service attempted to find speakers that could specifically address President Teddy Roosevelt since he played such a pivotal role in American conservation. I found three speakers that indicate they present motivational presentations based upon President Teddy Roosevelt:  David Markovitz, V. Neil Wyrick, and Keith McGough.  Each suggests they are motivational and entertaining but none mention they touch upon his achievements and leadership in the conservation arena nor do they indicate they also talk about the leadership characteristics of other leaders.  Their presentations based on their websites suggest they are focused solely on the life and actions of Teddy Roosevelt, which is not sufficient for the purposes of our Leadership Conference.
5) A Description of the Market survey conducted and the results. Based upon the market research conducted, no additional potential speakers were found that could address the issues that Dr. Douglas Brinkley has the ability to address nor have any written as extensively or exhaustively studied the lives of so many national leaders as Dr. Brinkley. I therefore conclude that there is no speaker other than Dr. Brinkley that can meet the requirements for making the keynote presentation. Mr. Brinkley will provide a presentation based upon fact-based knowledge of past leaders and more specifically on leadership characteristics for conservation purposes. All steps to remove or overcome barriers to competition have been taken.

Part time "Call as Needed" Histologist
Vendor:
John MorrisonFishtrap Technology3420 Fishtrap Loop NEOlympia, WA  98506-9646
John Morrison of Fishtrap Technology is the only known source that can meet Agency requirements.  The establishment of a new Histopathological Analysis services contract on an intermittent status is required to continue with assistance tot the Olympia Fish Health Center during periods of high work load.  An informal survey of the market was conducted and the following information was found:  Exercising this contract was determined to be in the best interest of the government; there are no other Histologists in the local commuting area that would be available to perform histopathological analysis and the diagnosis of diseased fish tissue samples from fish on a "call as needed basis".  To my knowledge, there are no other local contractors available for intermittent/on call histopathological assistance with the knowledge, experience and background that the Olympia Fish Health Center requires.  John Morrision, Fishtrap Technology, will exceed the contract expectation in accordance with the SOW.

<SUBJECT>Sole Source Notice of Intent for CoCreate Software License Maintenance Support Renewal
<SOLNBR>NB610030-A-03388
<RESPDATE>012710
<CONTACT>Keith Bubar, Contract Specialist, Phone 3019758329, Email keith.bubar@nist.gov
<DESC><p>Background: <br />This procurement is for software support, upgrades, and license renewal of PTC CoCreate software at the NIST center for Neutron Research (NCNR). The NCNR is responsible for the design, construction, and operation of the current instruments as well as new instruments. Their development plays a key role in the success of the neutron facility. Designing new instruments and upgrading existing instruments has been a major task undertaken by the staff of the NCNR using a network of PC based computer aided design (CAD) workstations running CoCreate Modeling and Annotation software. The NCNR has generated a substantial number of instrument and facility computer models and drawings that form the basis for new or upgraded instrument designs.</p>
<p>The CoCreate software package is the only software package that offers acceptable upward and downward compatibility with existing and future instrument designs. For this reason, NIST must renew the maintenance on the existing CoCreate licenses rather than purchase new licenses to a different software.</p>
<p>Synopsis: <br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), intends to negotiate with the Parametric Technology Corporation.; Needham, MA, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to renew the support/maintenance on the existing CoCreate software licenses at NIST NCNR. This procurement will serve to renew the maintenance for the period of February 1, 2010 through January 31, 2011.<br /><br />This requirement will renew the maintenance support on the following licenses:</p>

<DESC>The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Simplified Acquisition Division intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Applanix Corporation using the procedures in FAR Parts 6 and 13. The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Ocean Service (NOS), specifically the Coast Survey Development LAB uses the Applanix POS M/V GPS positioning and orientation system and the POSPac hydrographic survey package software for the NOAA hydrographic survey ships and survey launches. Training is required for new and experienced hydrographers who utilize the POS/MV and POSPac software. Applanix Corporation is the only party known to NOAA who can meet these requirements since they are the manufacturer of the POS/MV and PostPAC hydrographic survey package for marine positioning, which is an industry standard for marine surveying, positioning, and navigation. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 334511 with a small business size standard of 750 employees. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements. Responses must also be accompanied by descriptive literature, warranties, and/or other information that demonstrates that the quote meets all of the foregoing requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Delois.Clash@Noaa.Gov or faxed to (301) 713-0808 by January 26, 2010. Award will be made using FAR 13, Simplified acquisition procedures, current through FAC 2005-38. The determination to compete or not compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 5.203 (2) the U.S. Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-912) intends to solicit and negotiate with only one responsible source, Capital Project Management, Incorporated (CPMI) 1777 Sentry Parkway W., Abington Hall Suite 100; Blue Bell, PA 19422-2210, under the authority of FAR 6.302. This will be a one year base award with four 1-year options for Claims and Litigation support. The period of Performance is February 1, 2010 to January 29, 2015. The justification is as follows: The contract delivery schedule is driven by external sources and failure to produce accurate and timely responses would result in a failure of effort for DHS IG and DOJ to meet case development and prosecution timelines set by law. The Government has determined that a new company would have to engage in a substantial duplication of effort to become conversant on this program and this learning curve would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the government. The estimate for this duplication cost is approximately $1.8 million. <br />All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing via e-mail to: Andrew Price-Gibson - Andrew.Price-Gibson@uscg.mil by January 23, 2010 Telephone inquires will not be accepted. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements. <br />

<DESC><p>PRE SOLICIATION NOTICE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Safety Research (DSR) Protective Technology Branch ( PTB), Morgantown, WV has a requirement for Side Impact Testing of Type I/III and Type II Ambulances.</p>
<p>This requirement is solicited as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The CDC intends to award a single Firm-Fixed-Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.</p>
<p>No government-wide notes apply. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a Federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>All responsible responsive sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.<br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for professional services prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Requirements (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this requirement is 000HCCJC-2010-79310 and is hereby issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) using FAR Subpart 13.1 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. <br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NIOSH, Morgantown, WV intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract for the following requirement, please either fill in the dollar amounts or provide a separate excel spreadsheet containing the same information:<br />CLIN 0001: Total Price:<br />Side Impact Testing $<br />Development of a detailed instrumentation and test plan to support the creation of four side impact crash test pulses. <br />The period of performance for this effort is delienated in the Statement of Work under reporting schedule.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK <br />for the <br />Side Impact Testing of Type I/III and Type II Ambulances</p>
<p>I. Background <br />The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in partnership with the National Truck Equipment Association's Ambulance Manufacturers Division (NTEA-AMD), is working to improve worker safety in the patient compartment of U.S. based ambulances. This collaborative work builds on completed research performed by NIOSH under past NIOSH funded projects. One outcome of this collaborative effort has been the development of AMD Standard 025, "Measuring Guidelines: Occupant Head Clearance Zones". <br />Together, NIOSH and the NTEA are continuing to investigate opportunities to improve the structural integrity of the patient compartment, seating systems, the patient gurney, and equipment location and mounting utilizing existing NIOSH data. To that end, NIOSH, the NTEA-AMD, and its members have already developed an SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice (draft in review) to characterize the response of an ambulance when subjected to a full frontal crash into a barrier at 30 mph. It should be noted that while this is a standard requirement for all passenger vehicles weighing less than 8,500 lbs (in accordance with Federal Vehicle Motor Vehicle Safety Standards), virtually all U.S. ambulances operate above this weight and are, therefore, largely excluded from this requirement. <br />This proposed SAE "Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Frontal Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment" has been approved for balloting by SAE for further development and is now in its final revision. Likewise, the partners seek to develop a companion "SAE Recommended Practice" to characterize an ambulance's response in a side impact event. Unfortunately, the team has been unable to identify a dataset in the public domain suitable for use in the development of such a standard. Therefore, this contract is geared to develop such a dataset to support a well considered and defensible SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Side Impact testing (proposed).</p>
<p>II. Project Objectives Related to this Contract <br />This contract will create the needed ambulance side impact dataset.</p>
<p>III. Scope of Work <br />The Contractor will be responsible for the development of a detailed instrumentation and test plan to support the creation of four (4) side impact crash test pulses. Further, once approved, the Contractor will execute the test plan. The primary pieces of data derived from this testing, four pulses showing vehicle response over time, will be used by the NIOSH/NTEA-AMD team to develop a side impact test corridor suitable for inclusion in an as yet to be developed "SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Side Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment."</p>
<p>Should additional funding be identified from sources such as seating, restraint, or gurney manufacturers, the contract may be expanded to include instrumented manikins in the patient compartment using existing or modified seating, restraint or gurney components.</p>
<p>Given the collaborative nature of this contract and the expectation costs will be shared by two or more partners, the Contractor will be expected to ensure all partners are aware of individual manufacturer requests - as funding indicates. As the Contracting Agency, NIOSH must be informed of any requests from partners for additional tasking that may affect costs. The Contractor will not be expected to proceed on any partner request without written approval from NIOSH. Likewise, NIOSH will not assume responsibility for any change in the contract's cost without prior written approval from the Contracting Officer. Thus, the Contractor will be expected to work very closely with the NIOSH Project Officer and his counterpart at the NTEA-AMD to ensure all tasking is approved prior to incurring costs.</p>
<p>IV. Technical Requirements <br />Description of Specific Tasks or Phases: <br />The Contractor shall prepare a detailed proposal with line item costs for each of the tasks described below: <br />1. The Contactor will take receipt of two ambulances (a Type II and a Type I or III) as provided by industry partners. Appropriate documentation will be completed to transfer ownership from each industry partner to the Contractor without charge to the industry partner or sales payment by Contractor. <br />2. All industry partner markings, inside and out, will be obscured by the Contractor. <br />3. The vehicles will be prepared for impact testing in accordance with industry practices, FMVSS, and EPA requirements to provide for the safe handling of the vehicle and any hazardous fluids or materials. Appropriate documentation will be prepared by the Contractor to ensure compliance. <br />4. The contractor will work with the ambulance providers (industry partners) to identify the fore/aft, lateral, and vertical cgs of the full vehicle including the patient compartment and the patient compartment separate from the vehicle's chassis. <br />5. The contractor will develop a test plan that mirrors the impact requirements delineated in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's Side Impact Crashworthiness Evaluation Crash Test Protocol (Version V), dated May 2008. <br />6. The contractor will instrument each of two test vehicles (as provided by NTEA-AMD partners) in accordance with the vehicle and patient compartment instrumentation described in the illustration below (this instrumentation configuration is pulled from SAE 2007-01-4267: Crash Testing of Ambulance Chassis Cab Vehicles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please see attachment for pictures.</p>
<p><br />7. The Contractor will acquire 4 moving deformable barriers (MDB) as defined by the IIHS protocol. <br />8. The Contractor will conduct side impact crash testing twice on each vehicle: once on the curb side and once on the street side of each vehicle. <br />9. The strike location on the Type II shall be as follows: <br />a. Curb Side: Centered at combined chassis and patient compartment cg. <br />b. Street Side: Centered at the cg of the patient compartment only. However, if the positioning of the impact point at the cg of the patient compartment would allow the moving deformable barrier to impact the rear axle, the centerline of the impacting MDB shall be moved forward to allow the full MDB face to interact with the vehicle body forward of the axle.</p>
<p>10. The strike location on the Type I or III will be at the cg of the full vehicle (chassis and patient compartment as long as the centerline of the impacting MDB fully engages the patient compartment before impacting the cab of the vehicle. This impacting location will be used on both the curb and street side of the vehicle.</p>
<p>11. All measurements should be recorded and filtered according to the most recent version of SAE J211-1 and J211-2.</p>
<p>12. All instrumented data shall be provided in electronic spreadsheet format.</p>
<p>13. High speed video coverage of each test will be provided with a large enough field of view (perhaps both overhead and on the impacting side of the vehicle) to allow the full travel of impacted vehicle to be seen. Video data shall be provided in its original form and as reduced fidelity and slowed .mpg or .avi not to exceed 0.1 GB per video clip for use by the project team in a variety of presentation materials.</p>
<p>14. Once authorized to do so, the Contractor will complete all necessary documentation to dispose of each vehicle such that neither of these vehicles can reenter service.</p>
<p>V. <br />Reporting Schedule and End Products/Deliverables</p>
<p>This contract will have a two deliverables. Due Date Description of Deliverable and overall schedule <br />April 15, 2010 (Estimated dates) A draft test plan will be developed summarizing instrumentation location, calibration ranges, impact location, and all related and applicable SAE, FMVSS, AMD, or similar standards used to describe test criteria, instrumentation type, and instrument location. <br />April 31, 2010 (Estimated dates) All testing complete. <br />May 30, 2010 (Estimated dates) A summary test report which properly identifies all instrumentation locations, calibration limits, as well as, appropriate testing protocol and standards as needed to accurately describe and perhaps recreate testing. A full electronic data set on DVD(s) with all accelerometer data (filtered and</p>
<p>VI. Special Considerations</p>
<p>The Contractor must recognize funding for this project will be shared and thus provided to the Contractor by a variety of sources. In addition to NIOSH, the list of potential funding partners may include the NTEA-AMD, individual ambulance manufacturers, seat manufacturers, restraint manufacturers, and gurney manufacturers. While NIOSH will write the broad contract to cover the dynamic testing of two ambulances, individual partners may, with mutual consent, ask for and be granted the opportunity to "piggy-back" testing of their components (seats, gurneys, etc.), as installed in the interior of each ambulance, during full-scale testing of each ambulance. NIOSH will assist in the negotiation of a fair and equitable contribution for each partner depending upon their level of participation. However, NIOSH will not assume responsibility for the payment of any jointly negotiated payment beyond that expressly identified by NIOSH as representing its share of the test program. <br />The NTEA-AMD, through the generous donations of its members or other entities, will provide the test articles (2 ambulances). At no point will NIOSH nor the NTEA-AMD be listed as the title holder of record for either vehicle during the contracted test period. Rather, it is expected that the Contractor (test facility) will take possession of each test article from the donating organization. Once testing is complete and all test results documented, the Contractor will be responsible for the proper disposal of all test articles, including vehicles. <br />Your quote shall include the following:<br />&bull; Total proposed price <br />&bull; Capability Statements in accordance with the Statement of Work<br />&bull; Evaluation Criteria<br />Evaluation Criteria: <br />1. The degree to which the test facility has a quality assurance program that adequately ensures test equipment calibration, maintenance and record keeping is in order and fulfills the government's requirements.<br /><br />The test facility shall provide a copy of their quality assurance program and calibration records for those pieces of equipment proposed for this testing.</p>
<p>2. The degree to which the calibration records for those pieces of equipment proposed for this testing are within acceptable tolerances.</p>
<p>3. The degree to which the Contractor demonstrate their ability to perform the IIHS Side Impact Crash Test Protocol. This may be demonstrated in one of two ways:</p>
<p>a. Provide a copy of a test report from a previously executed IIHS Side Impact Crash Test, or</p>
<p>b. Provide a copy of a test report from a previously executed FMVSS 214 Side Impact Test</p>
<p>*** The report shall cover testing of, and instrumented data collect from, a full vehicle impacted by a moving deformable barrier matching either the IIHS Protocol or the FMVSS 214 test.</p>

An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been substantially transformed in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s). Note that any item that is a discreet article as it is sold in commerce, regardless of its ultimate function or use, cannot be considered substantially transformed based solely on its integration into IT or other systems.<BR><BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions. They shall not communicate to any person any information known to them by reason of their performance of services under this contract which has not been made public, except in the necessary performance of their duties or upon written authorization of the Contracting Officer.  All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>Electronic prescribing software that integrates the services in the three areas of electronic prescribing: prescription benefit, prescription history, and information regarding new and refill prescription routing to include not only retail pharmacies, but also mail order pharmacies which are overwhelmingly used by Department of State prescribers and patients overseas. This software will integrate Deparment overseas providers with electronic access to the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) designated by the health insurer utilized by the FS employee. Use of e-prescribing software will relieve the health care staff from mailing or faxing the prescription to the appropriate pharmacy benefit manager. In addition, overseas providers will be able to access the past three years of prescribing history for each patient. The verification of eligibility requirement is critical to ensure that FS employees and dependants are not denied coverage or are delayed from obtaining the medication if the prescription is sent to wrong pharmacy benefit manager. It should also be noted that e-prescribing has the proven benefits of reducing medication errors, improving clinical efficiency, and reducing overall healthcare costs. It is an integral component of the present initiative to overhaul and improve the US healthcare system. The statutory authority permitting other than full and pen competition is 6.302-1; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Office of Medical Services has used RxNT for the past three years and has found the software extremely user friendly; it provides all functionality that we require. RxNT also provides critical application support on a 24x7 basis. RxNT offers functionality in all three areas as evaluated by SureScripts. Surescripts is the independant organization that evaluates e-prescribing software as to its functionality in meeting the three required areas of integration, its commitment to e-prescribing, and whether the company is committed to improving their product by developing new approaches to e-prescribing. The commitment to improving the electronic prescribing system is critical to the Office of Medical Services, as we are not sure at this point that our future Electronic Health Record System will have the capability of transmitting prescriptions outside of the EHR. RxNT presentlly enljoys the heighest evaluation ranking by Surescripts, that of "Platinum", and is only one of two systems to enjoy that ranking.<BR><BR>

Statement of Work (SOW)

The Division of Microbiology in the Office of Regulatory Science has one OmniLog with Microstation system manufactured by Biolog, Inc. (Model#SC90004).  This system requires annual preventative maintenance for both the OmniLog and Microstation systems.  Annual preventive maintenance is critical to the continued functioning of this precision instrument as is the ability to have a service engineer physically on site in the case of major instrument failure.  This instrument uses both hardware and software that is unique to the OmniLog, and repairs can be costly without a service contract.  Additionally, the system uses proprietary Biolog, Inc. MicroPlate test panels which are read and analyzed by the system.  This service certifies that both of the instruments will produce results that parallel those determined by Biolog, and enables proper organism identification when compared with Biolog established databases.  The contractor shall provide services  including cleaning, replacing, and calibrating all instrument parts and supporting hardware.

We need our Biolog OmniLog and MicroStation instruments to be serviced annually by a company that will not void any remaining Biolog warranty from the original purchase of the equipment.

The service agreement needs to include the following items during its covered service agreement period:

1.	All labor, travel, expenses and parts for an unlimited number of on-demand service visits
2.	One preventive maintenance visit per year, which may include:
a.	Clean and inspect mirrors, camera lens and interference filters.
b.	Lubricate moving parts.
c.	Replace as required lamps and batteries.
d.	Adjust optical components.
e.	Check calibration with NAST traceable standards.
f.	Perform one or more of the following test protocols: Air Reference, Empty Carrier, Linearity, Repeatability, Channel-to-Channel, Hardware and Video tests.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for ELISA Kits

Statement of Work (SOW)

FDA has analytical data generated internally and provided by external sources
indicating the presence of melamine in food components used to manufacture a variety
of human and animal feed products including finished food products. In 2007, tainted
pet food was linked to foreign sources of gluten and other bulk protein products
originating from China. More recently, the illnesses of thousands of Chinese infants
has been linked to the intentional addition of melamine to milk that was subsequently
used as an ingredient in infant formula. This current situation has further raised the
agency's concern regarding the practice of utilizing melamine to give the appearance
that products contain a higher level of protein than they actually do for economic
benefit. Several surveillance assignments have been issued recently to address the most
current melamine situation. These assignments focus on the testing of milk derived
components and finished food products containing milk derived components originating
from foreign sources as well as the inspection of domestic infant formula
manufacturers. During domestic infant formula inspections, samples of the milk derived
components used to manufacture infant formula and finished products have been
collected and tested for melamine. In addition to product containing dairy products,

FDA has received reports of melamine found in products containing soy ingredients
To support the efforts of the current import assignment, the FDA must screen large
numbers of imported finished products.  FDA scientists use the kits requested to rapidly screen
defined food matrices for the presence of melamine. The specificity and sensitivity of the
above-named kits have previously been evaluated by agency scientists and meet the
stringent requirements established by the agency. Hence, the FDA has a critical need for
such a large quantity of kits to detect the presence of the chemical adulterant melamine.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] <br />[ ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. <br />[ ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); <br />(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and <br />(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. <br />(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies- <br />(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and <br />(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <br />(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN. <br />(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). <br />o TIN: ________________________________. <br />o TIN has been applied for. <br />o TIN is not required because: <br />o Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government. <br />(4) Type of organization. <br />o Sole proprietorship; <br />o Partnership; <br />o Corporate entity (not tax-exempt); <br />o Corporate entity (tax-exempt); <br />o Government entity (Federal, State, or local); <br />o Foreign government; <br />o International organization per 26 CFR 1.6049-4; <br />o Other ________________________________. <br />(5) Common parent. <br />o Offeror is not owned or controlled by a common parent; <br />o Name and TIN of common parent: <br />Name ________________________________. <br />TIN _________________________________. <br />(m) Restricted business operations in Sudan. By submission of its offer, the offeror certifies that the offeror does not conduct any restricted business operations in Sudan. <br />(n) Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations. <br />(1) Relation to Internal Revenue Code. A foreign entity that is treated as an inverted domestic corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code at 26 U.S.C. 7874 (or would be except that the inversion transactions were completed on or before March 4, 2003), is also an inverted domestic corporation for purposes of 6 U.S.C. 395 and for this solicitation provision (see FAR 9.108). <br />(2) Representation. By submission of its offer, the offeror represents that it is not an inverted domestic corporation and is not a subsidiary of one. <br />(End of provision)</p>

<p>Name Brand Justification for Teledyne RD Incorporated</p>
<p>The instruments are intended to be deployed for extended periods of time and provide near real-time accurate current data from numerous NDBC platforms. Configurations include but are not limited to buoys, C-MAN stations and sea-floor platforms. The specification provides details on four configurations intended for use at NDBC stations with different depths. These will be referred to as Deep Water (DW-DCP), Outer Shelf (OS-DCP), Inner Shelf (IS-DCP), and Shallow Water (SW-DCP).. These designations have been chosen to reflect the dominant oceanographic process driving the currents in these regions to allow vendors to tailor their instruments accordingly. Open ocean process drive the Deep Water, while winds and waves dominate the Inner Shelf and Shallow Water, respectively. The Outer Shelf is a transition between the Deep Water and Inner Shelf regions.</p>
<p>The procured item shall include all hardware and software necessary to make tilt compensated measurements of North, East and Vertical current velocity components as a function of depth and ocean temperature (at the instrument). The instrument shall be battery powered, with externally programmable deployment parameters and sampling schemes.</p>
<p>The instruments are intended to be deployed for nominal 1 year durations (400 days) drawing power from their own internal power source. The instruments will provide a current profile (ensemble) on an hourly basis to an NDBC payload on a continuous basis. Typical deployments will be from an in-line mooring cage or from a sea-floor mounted platform in a variety of ocean depths and temperatures. The instruments are required to meet the following basic performance characteristics for the duration of the deployment:</p>
<p><br />ADCP Model Profiling Range (M)<br />Bin Width (M) Std Deviation (cm/s)</p>
<p>Deep Water (DW) 120-400 16 0.50<br />Medium Range (MR) 50-120 4 0.33<br />Short Range (SR) 20-50 2 0.25<br />Ultra-Short Range (USR) 5&lt;20 1 0.20</p>
<p>The Profiling Ranges listed are based on expected deployment location depths. In this respect an Outer Shelf Doppler Profiler is expected to be equally effective in 50m of water as it is in 120m of water with "sonifying" the water column or suffering from side lobe interference. The instruments are expected to be able to profile the entire range of the water column of the deployment location to the upper limit of the instrument's range providing for an expected blanking distance based on the frequency of the instrument and the size of the bins used. The instrument shall be able to ping and process enough data to meet the standard deviations in the table above for the entirety of the deployment duration specified above and the nominal bin width detailed in the table.</p>
<p>The instruments shall be constructed of a single pressure vessel to include all hardware, transducers, batteries, and electronics. The pressure vessel shall have a minimum depth rating of at least 150m for all sensors with the exception of the DW which shall have a minimum rating of 400m. Options shall be available to purchase alternate pressure housings with depth ratings exceeding 5000m. The pressure housing shall be cylindrical for use with NDBC in-line mooring cages with a diameter of 7" (+/- &frac14;"). Minimum clear area in the cylindrical portion for attachment of "belly" clamps on the cage is 4". The DW version shall provide room for at least two "belly" clamps with a minimum of 12" separating them. In addition to the provisions for belly clamps, provisions for through-holes on the bottom flange are desired for potential mounting to sea-floor platforms. The length of the instrument shall not exceed 16-1/2" for all instruments except for the DW version which is limited to 42" due to expected increased battery capacity to meet requirements.</p>
<p>All external features of the housing including hardware/fittings shall be corrosion resistant or adequately protected from corrosion with cathodic protection for a minimum of a 1 year deployment. All external dissimilar metals shall be completely electrically isolated from one another. Preference will be given to external hardware that is corrosion-free (i.e. Titanium).</p>
<p>The overall outside diametric dimension of the transducer assembly shall not exceed 21-3/4" in order to ensure that the entire assembly is properly protected within existing in-line mooring cages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The instrument shall meet the performance criteria in 2.2 using internal replaceable battery packs. These performance specs need to be attained with alkaline-based batteries. Vendors may submit provisions for lithium battery power systems but these shall not be a substitute for meeting the alkaline-based battery performance criterion. The battery packs must be easily replaceable and the vendor shall provide a procedure for this process prior to award. As part of the bid the vendor shall provide cost information for the replaceable battery packs in quantities of 1, 5, 10, and 20.</p>
<p>In addition to this internal battery pack, provisions shall be made to externally power the unit. Preference will be given to vendors that can externally power the unit and have the ability to connect to multiple external battery cases (in pressure housings) in a daisy chain configuration via the external power connector.</p>
<p>In order to reduce the chance of catastrophic hydrogen build-up in the pressure housing, the vendor shall ensure that all aluminum components are completely isolated (through coating or physical means) from the potential of battery acid leaking from damaged cells and on to these components. Additionally, the vendor shall provide a means in which to relieve the internal pressure of the housing and sample/purge the internal gases prior to opening.</p>
<p>The instrument shall be able to measure the tri-axial velocity of the current profile to the following standards. The instrument shall be able to achieve these results in either an upward-looking or downward-looking configuration.</p>
<p>Relative Velocity: +/- 5m/s (Resolution 1mm/s, Accuracy +/- 5 mm/s or +/-1% of velocity)<br />Direction: 0-360 deg (Resolution 0.1 deg, Accuracy +/- 2 deg)</p>
<p>The instrument shall correct for instrument tilt and options shall be available to allow the instrument to track the ocean bottom or ocean surface in order to correct for lateral motion of the instrument platform (i.e. buoy) during the course of sampling. Extra pings required to accomplish this task are separate from the performance requirements of section 2.2 (i.e. if bottom tracking is selected on a DW-DCP then the number of "water" pings may be reduced in order to perform this additional function). This bottom tracking information shall be transmitted as part of the ensemble real time message. Preference will be given to internal firmware that actively employs the bottom-tracking information to remove the motion of the platform and determine the true current profile.</p>
<p>The instrument shall be equipped with a temperature sensor: 0-40 deg Celsius (Resolution: 0.01 deg, Accuracy: +/- 0.5 deg) for the purpose of making accurate speed of sound measurements. The transducer for this instrument shall be mounted such that it does not present itself as a potential snag point.</p>
<p>The number and size of the bins shall be user-selectable at the time of deployment. At a minimum, the instrument shall be capable of measuring 64 distinct bins. Preference will be given to instrument setup parameters that allow the DCP to have varied bins sizes in order to achieve higher resolution layers around areas of interest (i.e. in a downward-looking configuration mounted from a buoy it may be desirable to measure the upper bins in tight layers and then gradually expand these as the depth increases).</p>
<p>TRANSDUCERS</p>
<p>The instrument transducers shall be arranged in a 4-beam (clocked at 90 degree intervals) convex configuration. This arrangement is required in order to provide redundancy in the measurement if any one beam is blocked or experiences interference from a mooring line or from fish. The transducer assembly shall be removable from the instrument pressure housing for the purpose of maintenance and refinishing. The transducers shall be able to operate properly if painted with anti-fouling paint or other coating to reduce the damage from hard-bodied barnacles and other marine life. The vendor shall recommend a coating or coating system to reduce the likelihood of bio-fouling.</p>
<p>The instrument shall be equipped with a tilt sensor having a minimum of 2-axes. (Resolution: 0.01 deg, Accuracy: +/- 0.5 deg, Range: +/- 15 deg) for the purpose of accounting for semi-permanent heel angles of in-line mooring cages and resting angles of sea-floor platforms. Preference will be given to instruments that can accomplish this measurement in a dynamic environment and subsequently account for this positioning on a ping-for-ping basis for the purpose of removing the effect of the relative motion of the mooring or buoy if hard mounted to the buoy .</p>
<p>COMMUNICATIONS</p>
<p>The instrument shall be configurable from a standard Personal Computer (PC) serial port using RS232 communication protocol. At a minimum, the user shall be able to configure the instrument using the following parameters; Pings/Ensemble, Number of Depth Bins, Depth of Bins, Ensembles/Hour, Duration of Deployment, and Output format. The instrument shall be able to communicate through this same serial port during a normal deployment. The instrument shall be able to communicate at both 1200 and 9600 baud. The instrument shall be equipped with a removable, internal, non-volatile memory storage system using a commercially available format. Capacity for this storage shall be at a minimum capable of storing twice the expected data from the performance specs listed in section 2.2 (including individual ping data and housekeeping data).</p>
<p>It is advantageous for NDBC to have the output format of its DCPs be the same in order to reduce the costs associated with real-time shore-side processing. To support this effort, the vendor shall modify their firmware upon request in order to provide data in a Government-supplied format. The instrument shall have output formats that are 100% compatible with the Seabird Inductive Modem protocol and with the GOES Data Collection System telemetry protocol and format. Preference will be given to vendors that incorporate internal inductive modem capability into their instrument as an option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SOFTWARE</p>
<p>The vendor shall provide programming, test, and data processing software that is executable on a standard Windows 2000 PC or notebook computer. This software shall include, but not be limited to, absolute current profile data processing to standard engineering units (Meters-Kilograms-Seconds), programming and recording of deployment parameters, bit extraction software for creation of ASCII text files, and diagnostics testing. Data products produced by the software shall include time series of either current magnitude and direction or North/South and East/West components as a function of depth and time in their proper deployment configuration. Data products shall be produced by the software on the computer monitor and in hardcopy format. Diagnostics shall include at a minimum; verification of operational status, fault isolation, and fault identification. The vendor shall also provide software that allows the user to accurately estimate the power use of the unit for different deployment configurations.</p>
<p>The instrument shall be equipped with or have the software for performing internal diagnostics to check at a minimum the health of the internal circuit boards, battery pack(s), and transducers. In addition, the contractor shall provide a test plan with equipment specifications for performing laboratory verification of the operation of the acoustic signal processing and the operation of the transducers. This may consist of inserting a known sound into a tank with the instrument to ensure that the proper output is received from the signal processing circuitry. This test can also be any other appropriate test that performs that same verification. The instrument shall also demonstrate the ability to correct for the magnetic influence of the internal battery pack(s) and maintain the compass performance specification in paragraph 2.5</p>
<p>Preference will be given to instruments that have real-time diagnostics in the firmware that allows the instrument to analyze and flag data as questionable. Vendors shall provide details on the capabilities and limitations of these functions along with details on how to adjust any parameters to maximize the accuracy of real-time transmitted data.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide NDBC with documentation and test data demonstrating the proof-of-concept of their instrument against a known profile source or separately measured values from an independent instrument. If this documentation has been provided in the past to NDBC in is not necessary to duplicate this effort.</p>
<p>The following items shall be provided for each instrument that is purchased:</p>
<p>a) Instrument including fresh internal batteries (minimum remaining shelf life of 2 yrs)<br />b) New memory storage card<br />c) External power supply for laboratory testing (110 VAC input, output compatible with instrument voltage and current requirements)<br />d) RS-232 interface cable<br />e) Documents as per 3.1 and 3.2<br />f) Software as per 2.9<br />g) Service Kit (including at a minimum, replacement seals and hardware along with necessary assembly tools)<br />h) Ruggedized shipping container for marine applications for items a-g</p>

<p>Justification for Brand Only: "MATLAB is a mathematical analysis and processing package used by many of the PSD researchers in their day-to-day research. It is considered the de-facto standard for matrix manipulation and certain types of mathematical analysis. PSD currently has 20 floating (i.e. network accessible) licenses for the MATLAB program, along with a number of licenses for auxiliary (toolbox) software. While and open source equivalent does exist, PSD scientists have found significant differences between programs written for MATLAB and those that work in the open-source equivalents." NOAA has "downloaded and installed various open-source and freely available alternatives to the MATLAB package", but ran "into compatibility issues with existing legacy code with all these packages."</p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format stated in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and supplemented with additional information. The National Park Service contemplates award of a firm fixed price contract, as a result of this combined synopsis/solicitation, to the quoter providing the best value to the Government.

2)     STATEMENT OF WORK:
Base Line Item: Every year, an estimated 2,000 bear spray canisters (mace) are discarded into Yellowstone National Park's waste stream-ultimately ending up in the landfill. To date, there is no known solution to recycle these canisters within the United States. This statement of work is to design, construct and deliver a recycling unit that will capture all contents of the canisters and allow for the recycling of the aluminum canisters. The recycling unit must comply with all federal (OSHA), state (WY, MT) and National Park Service (NPS) health and safety regulations. Additionally, work is to include formalized training for NPS employees to operate the unit and a limited warranty on all components. The following is a description of the proposed recycling unit:The Bear Spray canister Recycler (BSR) must be designed to collect (for re-use) the 134A freon for its intended purpose and collect the Oleoresin Capsicum (Pepper oil) for possible use as alternative fuels blending. The BSR unit must also have the capability to puncture and flatten the empty aluminum canisters.  ,. The BSR unit is to be mounted on an appropriate size utility trailer with a conventional towing attachment so that it will be mobile.  The (BSR) system must not release flare gases or discharge any elements into the atmosphere. The collected Freon gases and the pepper oil will be collected in suitable onboard containers.  In essence, the contents of the small bear spray canisters would be segregated through a coalescing filter process allowing the recovery of each component. The (BSR) will use a closed Freon recovery system to comply with regulatory agencies that prohibit releases into the atmosphere.The (BSR) must have onboard electric powered pumps, compressor, fans, lights and all the necessary equipment to completely render the canisters recyclable.The (BSR) system must be safe for employees to operate.Line item includes all labor, materials and equipment necessary to supply the BSR to Mammoth Hot Springs, WY.Period of Performance:  The unit shall be delivered FOB to Mammoth Hot Springs, WY no later than August 1st, 2010.
Ordering and supplying: The contractor shall coordinate the exact date and time for delivery with the NPS.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations<br />and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming<br />litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing<br />protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are<br />encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute<br />Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested<br />parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the<br />contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who<br />believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to<br />the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested<br />party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal<br />process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does<br />not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a<br />timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:<br />solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if<br />applicable).

Limited<br />competition exists who can furnish spare parts with traceability to the manufactures. Request<br />approval to proceed with this acquisition, for a firm-fIxed-price contract for the purchase of<br />various high-use spare parts used in repair of the HC-l44A aircraft. It is anticipated that one<br />purchase order will be negotiated and awarded.<br />(3) Description ofSupplies/Services--This requirement is to procure Line Item 1: Wheel<br />NLG, 10 each, part number AHAI349, and NSN 1630~99~795~5662. The Coast Guard must<br />maintain an inventory of spare parts for maintenance and repair of the HC-I44A Guardian<br />aircraft and associated components. A situation involving a shortage of spare parts would<br />adversely affect delivery of aircraft undergoing programmed depot level maintenance. Not only<br />would this delay delivery and escalate depot maintenance costs, but would also impact aircraft<br />readiness rates in the field resulting in a decreased effectiveness of Coast Guard commanders'<br />ability to execute missions.<br />(4) Identification ofStatutory Authority Pennitting Other Than Full and Open<br />Competition--41 U.S.C. 428a as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)<br />6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy<br />Agency Requirements". Only the OEM or a limited number of distributors will satisfy agency<br />requirements.<br />(5) Demonstration That the Nature ofthe Acquisition Requires Use ofthe Authority<br />Cited- EADS CASA NORTH AMERICA, sole North American distributor of the Original<br />Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the HC-144A Guardian aircraft and its replacement parts and<br />owns exclusive data rights and blueprint specifications. The necessary specifications,<br />manufacturing drawings. data, test equipment and tooling required for the manufacturer of these<br />parts must be restricted to the parts manufactured by the OEM to ensure compatibility of<br />replacement parts and safe operation of the aircraft. The data and manufacturing rights were not<br />available or procured as part of the initial acquisition of this aircraft. The parts being sought are<br />continued demand consumables that have an inordinate ability to negatively impact flight<br />operations of the HC-l44A Guardian aircraft and progress of Programmed Depot Maintenance.<br />In a fiscal and stockage environment requiring minimal investment in inventory it is critically<br />Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) for Other than Full and Open Competition<br />SOLICITATION HSCG38-1O-Q-I00021 Date: Jan 15,2010<br />continued (5)<br />important to secure a reliable supplier that can satisfy the contract requirements needed to react<br />to ever changing demand patterns.<br />(6) Description ofEfforts made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from as Many<br />Potential Sources as is Practicable--In accordance with FAR 5.201, the intent to contract for the<br />HC-I44A Guardian aircraft replacement parts will be advertised in the Electronic Posting<br />System (EPS), Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) as a combined synopsis solicitation under<br />streamlined acquisition procedures for commercial items utilizing FAR Part 12. Any responsible<br />offers will be considered.<br />(7) Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government<br />will be Fair and Reasonable-The contracting officer will determine that the anticipated prices<br />will be fair and reasonable based on procurement history of previously negotiated procurements,<br />comparison with EADS CASA NORTH AMERICA commercial catalog pricing and comparison<br />with similar items in the commercial marketplace.<br />HC-I44A aircraft is not logistically supported by other Government agencies. The contract will<br />be solicited and awarded using acquisition procedures for commercial items. EADS CASA<br />NORTH AMERICA, OEM, is the primary source company that has been providing these unique<br />replacement spare parts to the US Coast Guard. The need to provide a reliable and continuing<br />source of these parts should eliminate resellers with limited quantities of "fire sale" parts they<br />can only supply once or only with excessive lead times by purchasing from EADS CASA<br />NORTH AMERICA. The market survey consisted of utilizing the Inventory Locator System<br />(ILS). It provided the same sources, the OEM, EADS CASA, and a few distributors. Market<br />research has indicated that the procurement of these parts and/or similar parts is commercial in<br />nature and is currently being procured for a variety of aircraft, both military and commercial.<br />(9) Any Other Facts Supporting the Use ofOther Than Full and Open Competition. i.e..<br />proprietary data packages. etc-- The HC-l44A aircraft was procured and provisioned for by<br />Coast Guard Headquarters, however that procurement did not include specifications necessary to<br />obtain competition. Due to the small fleet size, and the fact that this is an out-of-production<br />aircraft, it would not be economically feasible to procure the required data rights at this time. Nor<br />is there any indication that the OEM would be willing to sell their proprietary rights at this time.<br />(10) A Listing ofthe Sources. ifAny. That Expressed in Writing. an Interest in the<br />Acquisition--At this time, this J &amp; A is being processed in advance of the combined<br />synopsis/solicitation posting on FBO. If responses to the combined synopsis/solicitation indicate<br />additional sources are available, the file will be documented accordingly and the requirement<br />competed among all eligible sources.<br />(11) A Statement ofthe Actions. ifAny. the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome<br />Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services<br />Required--The Coast Guard does not possess technical expertise nor did they purchase the data<br />Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) for Other than Full and Open Competition<br />SOLICITATION HSCG38-10-Q-l00021 Date: Jan 15,2010<br />Continued (11)<br />as part of the initial system acquisition for the HC-l44A aircraft, as a result, it would be difficult<br />to foster a competitive procurement effort. Complete specifications, manufacturing drawings,<br />data, test equipment and tooling for the HC-l44A are not available and the cost to procure them<br />is not easily quantifiable. As the Aircraft Inventory Control Point (AICP), ALC is tasked with<br />supporting systems that have been deployed for used in the aviation community. As such our<br />budget does not include funding to procure data for these systems. The data for the HC-l44A<br />aircraft is proprietary to the OEM and therefore future competition for this effort is not known.<br />The agency has taken no actions to overcome barriers to competition and does not anticipate any<br />opportunities to do so. In an effort to increase competition among the sources, HC-I44A<br />Product Line members annually attend aviation trade shows, extensive Internet database research<br />is conducted and procurements are advertised in FBO.<br />(12) Contracting Officer's Certification--<br />I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition is<br />accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br />MRS Division, Contracting Officer<br />(13) TechnicalJReguirements Personnel Certification--<br />I certify this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data,<br />which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate.<br />Blaine W.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Washington, DC</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Program Manager is a member of one of DCHA/OTI's Regional Teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, DC. OTI currently has three regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division (FPD): Asia and Middle East (AME), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC).

<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Regional Team Leader or his/her designee (e.g. the Sr. Program Manager), the Program Manager will:</p>

<p>&bull; Provide backstopping and troubleshooting support to field-based staff through frequent communication;</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;</p>

<p>&bull; Perform complex country analysis and program design to develop existing and future programs and strategies in high priority countries;</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in design and implementation of new country program operations to include management, logistical, budget, administrative, personnel and contractual issues;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, participate on inter-office, inter-bureau, or inter-agency committees where issues relate to OTI's program goals;</p>
<p>&bull; In limited circumstances, the incumbent may be required to provide assistance to organizations outside of OTI but within the current scope of work, where such assistance would enhance both OTI's goals and objectives as well as the incumbent's job skills;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting team leader or country or deputy country representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull; Mentor/train other OTI Program Assistants / Program Managers as required; and,</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of country programs.</p>

<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Program Manager will take direction from and will report to their respective OTI Regional Team Leader within the Field Programs Division or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on assessment teams, Country Start-Ups, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Due to this historical significance, the system to be designed, furnished, and installed must not only be a complete working climate control system with both heating and air conditioning specifications as set forth in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), it must also be designed and installed in such a manner as to maintain the historic nature of the aircraft. <br />(Note: "design" in this instance refers to any method the offeror chooses to use that clearly demonstrates the offeror's ability to comply with all the requirements of this notice, attachments, and PWS.)<br />The Government has determined through research that the Mitsubishi "Mr. Slim" ductless air conditioning system meets the challenges of ensuring minimal damage while preserving the aesthetics of the aircraft. However, the Government will accept any proposed design/products/installation that conforms to the PWS while maintaining historic integrity. <br />

<p style="text-align: left;">Transformer (TX)<br />Tactical Technology Office<br />Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</p>
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Workshop in support of a planned Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Transformer (TX) program. The workshop will occur at 0700-1500 EST on January 14, 2010, at Westin Arlington Gateway, 801 North Glebe Road, Arlington, VA 22203.</p>
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and program planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Workshop is intended to introduce to the research community the TX program vision, goals and objectives, and opportunities associated with the development of interdisciplinary teams to respond to an anticipated Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). The workshop does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Attendance at the workshop is voluntary and is not required to propose to any potential related Broad Agency Announcements or potential research solicitations on this topic. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to participate in this Industry Day.</p>
<p>The objective of the Transformer (TX) program is to demonstrate a 1 to 4 person transportation vehicle that can drive and fly, thus enabling the warfighter to avoid water, difficult terrain, and road obstructions as well as IED and ambush threats. The vehicle will be capable of driving on prepared surface and light off-road conditions, while flight functionality will require Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL). In addition, range and speed efficiencies will allow for tactically relevant missions to be performed on a single tank of fuel. The ability to provide the warfighter a platform that enables terrain-independent mobility would significantly affect how distributed operations are performed today. Current transport systems present operational limitations where the warfighter is either anchored to the ground with HMMWVs and thus vulnerable to ambush, or reliant on helicopters, which are limited in flight speed and availability. TX provides the flexibility to adapt to traditional and asymmetric threats by providing the operator unimpeded movement over difficult terrain. In addition, transportation is no longer restricted to trafficable terrain that tends to makes movement predictable. The TX vehicle also allows the warfighter to approach targets from directions opportune to them and not the enemy.</p>
<p>Within the TX program, DARPA seeks to: 1) Develop a robust vehicle design that maximizes military utility at a reasonable cost, 2) Identify and mature the critical enabling technologies necessary to vehicle development, and 3) Build a single prototype vehicle that demonstrates the program goals through ground and flight tests. Technologies relevant to the objectives of the TX program can be found in numerous disciplines and areas of research including: hybrid electric drive, advanced batteries, adaptive wing structures, ducted fan propulsion, lightweight composite materials, advanced flight control technology for stable transition from vertical to horizontal flight, and others.</p>
<p>To facilitate maximum participation DARPA will host a TX Proposers' Day Workshop. The workshop will: (a) Introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the TX program vision and objectives; (b) Explain the mechanics of a DARPA program and the milestones and metrics of this potential effort; and (c) Promote teaming arrangements among organizations having relevant expertise, facilities, and capabilities to execute an interdisciplinary research program responsive to the TX program goals. The workshop will include overview presentations by Government personnel and a poster session to facilitate interaction and team building among the session participants. Potential participants should note that formation of teams with sufficient expertise to address all technical areas is critical. Workshop participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters describing areas of capabilities in order to facilitate discussions during the poster session.</p>
<p>There is no fee to attend the TX Proposers' Day Workshop. Registration for the workshop is limited by the venue capacity. To maximize the number of organizations participating, there is a limit of three persons per organization. Early registration is strongly recommended. The poster session will be limited to 1 poster per organization with a cut-off of 100 posters total. The registration cutoff date has been extended to 4:00PM ET, January 11, 2010.</p>
<p>Workshop details including registration, poster session, meeting location, and lodging are provided on the registration website.</p>
<p>Workshop Details: <br />Time: January 14, 2010, 7:00am-3:00pm<br />Location: Westin Arlington Gateway<br />801 North Glebe Road<br />Arlington, VA 22203 <br />(800) 627-7076 (Reservations)<br />(703) 717-6200 (Hotel Operator)<br />Registration Website: http://www.sa-meetings.com/TX2010 (Password = TX2010)</p>

A foreign end product may be purchased if it is determined that the price of the lowest domestic offer is unreasonable or if another exception applies, and (2) Requires, with some exceptions the use of only domestic construction materials in contracts for construction in the United States (3) Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product. (a) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and (b) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components.
Buy American Act Certificate (June 2003)52.225-2 Buy American Act Certificate: (a) The offeror certifies that each end product, except those listed in paragraph (b) of this provision, is a domestic end product and that the offeror has considered components of unknown origin to have been mined, produced, or manufactured outside the United States. The offeror shall list as foreign end products those end products manufactured in the United States that do not qualify as domestic end products. The terms component, domestic end product, end product, foreign end product, and United States are defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled Buy American ActSupplies. TO COMPLY, SELLERS MUST LIST THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN IN EACH LINE ITEM.<BR><BR>Electronic prescribing software that integrates the services in the three areas of electronic prescribing: prescription benefit, prescription history, and information regarding new and refill prescription routing to include not only retail pharmacies, but also mail order pharmacies which are overwhelmingly used by Department of State prescribers and patients overseas. This software will integrate Deparment overseas providers with electronic access to the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) designated by the health insurer utilized by the FS employee. Use of e-prescribing software will relieve the health care staff from mailing or faxing the prescription to the appropriate pharmacy benefit manager. In addition, overseas providers will be able to access the past three years of prescribing history for each patient. The verification of eligibility requirement is critical to ensure that FS employees and dependants are not denied coverage or are delayed from obtaining the medication if the prescription is sent to wrong pharmacy benefit manager. It should also be noted that e-prescribing has the proven benefits of reducing medication errors, improving clinical efficiency, and reducing overall healthcare costs. It is an integral component of the present initiative to overhaul and improve the US healthcare system. The statutory authority permitting other than full and pen competition is 6.302-1; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Office of Medical Services has used RxNT for the past three years and has found the software extremely user friendly; it provides all functionality that we require. RxNT also provides critical application support on a 24x7 basis. RxNT offers functionality in all three areas as evaluated by SureScripts. Surescripts is the independant organization that evaluates e-prescribing software as to its functionality in meeting the three required areas of integration, its commitment to e-prescribing, and whether the company is committed to improving their product by developing new approaches to e-prescribing. The commitment to improving the electronic prescribing system is critical to the Office of Medical Services, as we are not sure at this point that our future Electronic Health Record System will have the capability of transmitting prescriptions outside of the EHR. RxNT presentlly enljoys the heighest evaluation ranking by Surescripts, that of "Platinum", and is only one of two systems to enjoy that ranking.<BR><BR>

o	Provide federal agency personnel with self-service vehicle scheduling and access to GSA Fleet vehicles

o	Display to authorized federal employees these GSA Fleet vehicles on the reservation system via the internet.

•  Provide both customer agency fleet managers and GSA Fleet with detailed vehicle utilization reports.

•  Provide training to the government employees on how to use the reservation system.

•  Provide technical assistance and troubleshooting for both the vehicle equipment and web-based services at no additional cost

Deliverables:

o	Start and end time/dates
o	Miles driven
o	Vehicles used
o	Starting and ending locations
o	Quantity of reservations by vehicle by date

Points of Contact and Responsibilities:

Projects will typically be located on military installations within North Carolina; however, performance of work is not necessarily restricted to such. A project requiring use of civil funds or otherwise termed as civil construction is not authorized under this contract.<br /><br />This acquisition is being offered as a HUBZone set aside. The life of the basic contract is for a base period of three (3) years with two (2) one-year option periods or $100M; whichever occurs first. The pool size (number of contracts that may be awarded) shall not exceed five (5) contractors. The pool of contractors which successfully receive an award will share the total contract capacity of $100M. The Government will use a best value Performance Price Trade-off (PPT) evaluation process in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.101-1. The order limitation of task orders, to include the seed task order that will be used for evaluation purposes and award of the initial contracts, shall range between $750K and $10M. Task orders issued under this MATOC will be firm-fixed price. The initial seed task order may include options.<br /><br />Description of work: Task orders placed under this MATOC may be either of a design-build nature or that of a design-bid-build (construction only) nature. Work may include but is not limited to the design and the construction of various types of facilities including but not limited to, administrative, recreational, educational, religious, medical, and training type, to include ranges, as well as their corresponding support facilities. Work under this MATOC is not solely restricted to new construction but may also include repairs, renovations, alterations, or additions to existing facilities, such as those already cited, or infrastructure such as roads, parking, drainage systems, utility systems, and force protection.<br /><br />Evaluation Criteria: The Government will use a Performance Price Trade-off (PPT) evaluation process in rendering the best value decision for award of this contract. Only that Offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value of those Offerors selected to be in the MATOC pool, if any, will also be awarded the seed task order. All other successful Offerors, if any, will be awarded a contract with a minimum guarantee of $2,500.00. The evaluation factors and their relative importance for this solicitation and evaluation process are as follows: <br /><br />Non-cost Factors: FACTOR 1: PAST PERFORMANCE: This factor is equal in importance to Factor 2 and more important than Factor 3. FACTOR 2: CORPORATE RELEVANT SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE: This factor is equal in importance to Factor 1 and more important than Factor 3. FACTOR 3: DESIGN EXPERIENCE:<br /><br />Price: All non-cost factors, when combined, are equal in importance to Price. <br /><br />Award will be made to those Offerors whose technical submittal and price proposal contain the combination of criteria requested which offers the best overall value to the Government. Proposals shall include sufficient detailed information to allow complete evaluation. The Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Quantico, Virginia, awarded a five year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract No. M67854-10-D-1038 to Milkor USA, INC, 3735 N. Romero Road, Tucson, AZ 85705-3031 in support of future delivery orders for Multi-Shot Grenade Launcher (MSGL) weapon systems for $42.2 Mil. The MSGL is a lightweight, shoulder fired grenade launcher capable of being carried and employed by one operator over rough terrain or in urban environments.  It was specifically designed to meet the requirement for an area fire weapon with a high rate of fire and a maximum range of 400m.  It can also be employed with greater accuracy at ranges up to 150m.  All elements of the system are suitable for transportation by land, sea, and air.  The weapons system is not a replacement for the 1960s era M203 grenade launcher.  Rather, the MSGL will be an additive capability to the receiving units. 
Delivery of contract line items will be as stated on applicable delivery orders. 
Contract funds will be obligated in multiple delivery orders.  
This contract was competitively procured via full and open competition. Solicitation M67854-09-R-1002 was released on 20 April, 2009, initiating the formal procurement process with commercial industry. Amendment 0001 to the solicitation was released on 15 May, 2009.    
Effective award date of contract M67854-10-D-1038 is 20 January, 2010.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>SKE500-10-C-0003
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (OVERSEAS CONTRACTING ACTIVITIES) 
1)	I recommend that Embassy Nairobi use other than full and open competition for the acquisition of legal services for the purchase of Rosslyn Ridge. The estimated cost is ¬$120,000.00 
2)	Nature and/or description of the action being approved. 
We required a contractor to provide legal services to PURCHASE a 60 unit residential compound in Nairobi, Kenya known as Rosslyn Ridge. The vendor had to close within 60 days as outlined IN THE CONTRACT with the owner of the compound and the USG. 
•	Prepare a Memorandum on the local real estate practices and laws. 
•	Summarize the costs that are customarily paid by each of the parties. ~. 
•	Review the draft Conditional Purchase Agreement. 
•	Incorporate the terms negotiated by Embassy in the CPA. 
•	Apply for host country approval/waivers of stamp duties. 
•	Submit Pre-Purchase Certification (title search). 
•	Perform the final title search of the property to be acquired. 
•	Review boundary survey and A&E inspection reports. 
•	Prepare and register all documents required for the formal transfer. 
•	Prepare and submit Post-Purchase Certification. 
	• 	Participate in related meetings and negotiations, as needed. 
Note - the above steps were to be completed in less than two months. 
3)	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs. 
As stated #2. 
4)	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 41 U.S.C. 253(2)(1), 
5)	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited (for sole source acquisitions; also required for unusual and compelling urgency where more than one offer will not be solicited). The named company Hamilton Harrison & Mathews have provided the same services required by the Government before and have been called upon on emergency cases and have proved efficiency and capable. Specifically, after the bombing attack on the Embassy building a temporary location was identified to use until the move to a permanent location. Again, given the time sensitivity, this firm was the only one that was able to negotiate with the party to get the IOB. This was a special negotiation as the legal firm was able to negotiate to sell it back to the owner once a new location identified. Purchasing the NEC in the middle of a residential area required special tasking to make it happen. USG was able to make this happen with the legal assistance of HH&M. OBO is familiar with these work and wanted the same to be involved for RR purchase. This is the first time OBO made such a purchase of a large residential compound. 
6)	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable. The description should include whether a FedBizOpps notice was or will be publicized, as required by FAR 5.2, and if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies (e.g., blanket waiver provided in DOSAR 605.202-70). 
FedBizOpps notice will be publicized as required by FAR 5.2 
7. A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. We consulted the price with the local market value including the AID lawyer who agreed that this was a fair price. The initial price was $250,000 but was negotiated to a final price of$120,000. While legal rates are set by the Kenyan law, we were able to use a specific formula to determine the exact figure of 120,000. As the value transaction increases the incremental amount should decrease; the total value of 24.5 million USD. According to the Kenya Subsidiary Legislation 2009/Advocate Act, the fees indicated for transactions of less than 500 million Kenyan shillings is 1 % of the value of transaction in our case 1 % of 500 million Kenyan shillings comes to $67,114.10. The issue the GSO had to deal with was first at what rate the lawyer will be paid for the transaction value above the 500million Kshs i.e. 1.325 billion Kshs. Second the value associated with special circumstance of the buyer, USG diplomatic mission in areas such as tax exemption, avoidance of having to open an escrow account, in general accomplishing the transaction in less that two months in an extremely corrupt and bureaucratic system where such transactions take months if not a year to accomplish. The value attached to service by the lawyer is was his bill for $250,000. Final agreement was reached at $120,479.87 which represents the 1 % fee for the first 500 million Kshs and 3%transaction value between 500 million Kshs and 1.325 billion (24.5USD) 
8)	A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted. Legal rates are set on real estate transactions in Kenya by Kenyan law. Post did not have time to conduct a market survey due to the time line of the closing on the property. Since rates are set by Kenyan law, a market survey would have concluded the same results. In addition, most legal firms demand advance payment before services are provided. Current firm agreed to proved services required without advance payment and were at the time, the best technically qualified, reputable and proven firm available to close such a large real estate transaction in such a short period of time that was required by the contract 
9)	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. 
OBO in Washington asked to use this firm and this firm only. This is based on their past experience on buying and selling a new office building and buying the current NEC. 
10)	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. 
The vendor was chosen by OBO based. This was the only firm that could complete the purchase by the timeline set by OBO (before fiscal year end). Nairobi is a critical crime post and one of the recommended goals is to get scattered houses in a compound.

<DESC>This brand of equipment is requested to maintain uniformity and common troubleshooting to minimize downtime. CISCO products are required to ensure consistency in the design, continuity of training, ease of use, and interoperability. CISCO switches, routers and network equipment provide component inter-operability. Camp Arifjan is currently running a CISCO protocol on the CISCO equipment. Non-Cisco equipment will not inter-operate correctly with the networks current implementation. All tools for management and managing equipment are specifically designed to support CISCO devices. Site personnel and system administrators are trained extensively on CISCO equipment. Re-training of site personnel is cost prohibitive and is not justifiable. If 160th receives non-CISCO equipment, devices will not function or inter-operate properly with current CISCO equipment and have the potential to sit idle as they will not furnish the site with the equipment required to provide continued services. These CISCO Switches are available under an existing CHESS contract.
USACC will solicit from multiple CHESS vendors. The items must be the specific brand name items and are listed on the Approved Product Listing.
