<DESC>Project 228 Mechanical Fuels Reduction Project.  Mow/mulch vegetation on approximately 47 acres and thin/remove vegetation on approximately 82 acres on Bureau of Land Management Public Land.  Conventional logging equipment would be used to thin ponderosa pine, thereby reducing the fuel loading, increasing the distance between tree crowns, and creating a more natural, clumpy structure.  Mechanical equipment such as a Hydro-mower or Hydro-axe would be used to mow/mulch vegetation within the project area to create larger openings and increase the distance between clumps.  A mosaic of mature oak would be retained within the project area to benefit wildlife, create diversity within the vegetation, and enhance visual aesthetics.  Approximately .5 miles of temporary road construction will need to be built.  This project is set aside for small business concerns.  This solicitation for this project will only be made available through the Federal Business Opportunities website - www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and FAR 6.302-3 with Owl Computing Technologies, Inc., 38A Grove Street Suite 101, Ridgefield, CT 06877 for the purchase of two (2) 3.3 Volt Universal Cards; one (1) year Continued Application Hot Line Service and Support; and one (1) Turn-In of 5.0 Volt Universal Cards.  Information received within 7 days after date of publication of the solicitation will be considered by the Government. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   The NAICS code is 511210.  

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:  

AFRL/IFSA requires Volt Universal Cards for on-going test, assessment, evaluation, and demonstrations of Software Technologies currently under development.  Owl Technologies Dual-Diode is a Turn-Key configuration that meets technical specifications (Linux OS) and is used by other members of the Next Generation Chemical Biological Management effort.  There is not a fully compatible alternative that exists in the marketplace.  Introducing software other than what is specified above results in incompatible systems that do not function properly.  Furthermore, the system cannot interface properly with the existing infrastructure that is being utilized.  The proposed source, Owl Computing Technologies, Inc. is the only known source that can satisfy the government's requirement for Secure Directory and Maintenance that will support the existing infrastructure.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

SCOPE OF WORK

The USNA is looking to purchase an AppMan System in response to a requirement to better assure the performance, integrity, and security of our application infrastructure. We are looking to start from the network management perspective and bring server, application, and other management domains under one umbrella and an Application Management System which does exactly this.
The AppMan System needs to report performance for key business functions, sites, and services, and prioritize troubleshooting, including an application services topology that helps visualize and explore the flow of application services between business entities. The need to look at end-to-end IP conversation, across any IP network type, between two business entities: a business resource provider and a business resource consumer (e.g., application and user, server and client); to quickly isolate problems to the server, application, or network and assign the right management team. An infrastructure view to pinpoint cloud issues such as peering, route, BGP, and MPLS problems. USNA needs delivery of detailed data about end-to-end application response time (broken down by server, network, and application performance and delay), network utilization, route composition and quality, and ISP/AS performance and utilization with a system of simply installed and easily managed appliances. The system must adapt automatically to changes in the application infrastructure so that data is always displayed in the context of its impact on the business, and its intelligent data aggregation algorithms making sure that the data with the most business value is always available; delivering a unified view of the network. This equipment and accessory products must allow managers to easily specify the logical structure of the application infrastructure, and based on this data it should automatically correlate and duplicate data from multiple sources to present a unified logical and physical view of the network. This includes a unique application service topology that enables managers to visualize and explore the flow of application services between business entities. Our local administrators need to be able to set policies and act on problems. In addition, the unified view of server, application, and network performance and utilization it delivers to both local and global managers encourages collaboration between different management "silos" (e.g., server, database, application, network, etc.). The result is radically simplified network troubleshooting, easier deployment of new applications and services, and reduced operating expenses. 
This requirement shall be a turnkey/integrated solution. Software, Hardware, Integration & Training shall be included in this proposal.

This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals.  However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient details to allow NICHD to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.  The NIAID is seeking qualified organizations that are capable of managing and have the capacity to provide the scientific, technical and operational support to NIAID HIV and AIDS research activities, particularly clinical research, conducted through grants and contracts.  The NIAID is currently supporting approximately 400 trials related to HIV and AIDS in various stages.  These trials range from 10 to 6000 participants and are conducted in 46 countries.  Approximately 22 of the 46 countries are resource limited.  The Contractor may be asked to provide assistance, and assessment, or consultation related to any of the NIAID HIV AIDS funded clinical studies and be aware that NIAID sponsors multiple large, international trials at the same time.

The resultant contract is intended to augment the capacity of services provided by existing research support contracts to provide flexibility and scalability.  Performance will involve daily interaction between the Contractor and NIAID staff for activities that require continuity, a high degree of collaborative problem solving, and time sensitive decision making. Contractor expertise and support shall be provided in the following major areas:  Clinical Research Support, Program Research and Operations Support, Communications Support, Conflict of Interest Mitigation, Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality, and Project Management.  

Proposals will be evaluated to determine that offerors have: 1) Demonstrated experience with contracts of similar size and scope to this proposed effort.  Contract projects listed may include those entered into by the US Federal Government, agencies of state or local governments, for-profit and non-profit entities; 2) Proposed key personnel that demonstrate that your organization has the necessary expertise to perform the requirements of the project; 3) Sufficient corporate qualifications needed to perform the requirements of the project; 4) Close physical proximity of the Contractor?s main or satellite office and/or plans to ensure that this interaction can be successfully accomplished in a cost-effective and timely manner; 5) A satisfactory strategy to be used to mitigate individual and institutional conflicts of interest, disclosure and confidentiality concerns; and 6) Demonstrated capability to rapidly identify and recruit personnel, administer and coordinate interrelated tasks and familiarity with national and international regulations and requirements related to clinical trials. 
 
It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, term type contract will be awarded for a period of two (2) years beginning on or about December 1, 2007 with options to extend the period of the contract up to five (5) additional years.  It is estimated that seventy-seven (77) full time equivalents (FTE) will be required on a yearly basis.  Options will also be included to increase the level of effort in any year in increments of ten (10) FTE.  The maximum expansion would be eight (8) increments of ten (10) FTE for a total of 157 FTE.  
Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about March 20, 2007, and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and through the FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to provide services in support of the Digital-to-Analog Converter Box Coupon Program authorized by section 3005 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The Coupon Program provides for distribution and redemption of coupons that consumers may apply toward the purchase of digital-to-analog converter boxes. The converter boxes will enable consumers to watch over-the-air television broadcasts on analog televisions once television stations cease analog broadcasting on February 17, 2009, as required by law. The services required cover three broad functional areas: (1) consumer education and communications, (2) systems processing (e.g., determine consumer eligibility, coupon distribution and activation, and certify retailers and provide training materials), and (3) financial processing (e.g., administer the coupon authorization for redemption, and retailer payment process, and perform independent auditing). 

NTIA plans to award a single contract for an end-to-end solution and execution of the Coupon Program that encompasses all three functional areas.  The Coupon Program components require expertise across a variety of fields.  NTIA encourages potential Offerors to include expertise from small businesses as well as large businesses to provide the best mix of resources to enable NTIA to execute the Coupon Program efficiently and effectively.

NTIA expects to issue an RFP on or about January 26, 2007. If circumstances permit, a draft RFP will be issued prior to that time. NTIA expects to host a Bidder's Conference after RFP release.  Details will be provided on NTIA website as they are finalized.  NTIA anticipates an approximate 27-month contract performance period with several major milestones mandated by law. For further information, call Diane Trice at (301) 713-0838 ext 102, email diane.trice@noaa.gov.   
 
All contractors doing business with this acquisition office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). NO award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR.  For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site:  http:///www.ccr.gov/ .

NCIs cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) was announced as a three-year pilot project in July, 2003, and launched in February 2004.  caBIG is developing a network or grid connecting individuals and institutions to enable the sharing of data and tools, creating a World Wide Web of cancer research.  The ultimate goal is to speed the delivery of innovative approaches for the prevention and treatment of cancer; however, the infrastructure and products of caBIG? are widely applicable outside the cancer community.  Over 900 individuals from more than 80 organizations are currently participating. 

As the caBIG initiative enters its fourth year, the NCI has the opportunity to conduct a business development effort that will expand caBIG into a technically and economically self-sustaining ecosystem that supports the broader cancer community in the coming years and serves as a model for other disease areas.

The National Cancer Institutes Center for Bioinformatics and Information Technolgoy (NCICBIT) seeks support for a stakeholder development effort that would make recommendations for a process for engaging a broad spectrum of constituencies to identify the opportunities and obstacles to widespread adoption of caBIG in the future, the output of which could form the foundation for a full-scale caBIG business plan.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Interoperability of the  components is essential to functional system; components not certified by Enturst and  Safenet may prove non-functional in this configuration. At this time, Entrust nor Safenet  cannot guarantee that products purchased from sources other than Safenet will support the  continued operation of the Departments PKI.  (4)  ~n identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open  competition.  IRM/OPS/ITI/SI requires SafeNet Luna products to be procured on a brand name only basis.  Therefore, 41 use 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy  agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1  (c), is cited at the statutory authority.  (5) A demonstration  that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of  the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:  Entrust and Safenet will only provide support for products purchased from Entrust or  Safenet. If there are support issues on product not purchased through Entrust or Safenet, they  will defer to the supplier of the product. Maintenance of these products is required to ensure  that any problems with the equipment will be rectified immediately by Entrust and Safenet.  Installation of a different hardware security module may have the following issues:  1.  Non-compliance with DoS approved desktop software configuration, voiding other  warranties associated with the equipment and software.  2.  Interoperabilitycannotbe guaranteed..  3.  Support fro functional enhancements made to the system, as part of the PKI or future  medications cannot be guaranteed to be supported.<BR><BR>(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential  sources as is practicable, including whether a CBD synopsis was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. Attempts were made to gain quotes on the requested items from other vendors. (7) A determination  by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government  will be fair and reasonable.  A price analysis will be conducted to determine if the cost is fair and equitable.  (8) A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement  of the  reason market research was not conducted.  Safenet is the manufacturer and only provider that can upgrade, update, patch and support  their software, as well as replace defective hardware with equipment with identical technical  specification to those currently installed, Safenet, Inc. is the sole source.  (9) Any other facts supporting  the use of other than full and open competition:  No additional information provided.  (10) A list of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: NA  (ll)A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take t remove or overcome any  barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services  required.  PKIlBLADE is a COTS solution that provides PKI functionality and biometric authentication  to the OpenNet. Even though it is a COTS solution, it is also a proprietary solution. Should  a wider variety of digital encryption services and products become known to IRM/SI, these  products will be considered as potential sources.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) issued a solicitation on March 2, 2007, for a competitive grant program entitled "Highways for LIFE Technology Partnerships Program." FHWA anticipates making 12 awards at the $200,000 funding level and up to 3 awards at the $500,000 funding level. The solicitation is available at www.Grants.gov under Funding Opportunity Number DTFH61-07-RA-00106. Proposals are due April 16, 2007. FHWA will conduct a pre-proposal teleconference on March 15 to discuss the program and address any questions from potential applicants. See page 2 of the solicitation (full announcement) on www.grants.gov for details on the pre-proposal teleconference. The purpose of the Highways for LIFE (HfL) Technology Partnerships Program is to work with the highway construction industry to accelerate the adoption of promising innovations.  Innovations is an inclusive term used by HfL to convey all of the following, but not limited to:  technologies, materials, tools, equipment, procedures, specifications, methodologies, processes, or practices used in the financing, design, or construction of roads or highways.  This component of the Highways for LIFE Program is intended to provide the financial impetus to adapt a proven non-highway related innovation or to refine or improve existing equipment, materials, practices, or processes that have been demonstrated but not become adopted as routine or common practice in the highway industry. The program is intended to fund innovations that have been developed to a prototype and require further refinement, testing, evaluation and first application in a real-world setting before they would be available for purchase, or conventional practice.

STATEMENT OF WORK

PROJECT TITLE:  Advisory Services to the Center for Veterinary Medicine 


A.  BACKGROUND
The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) regulates the manufacture and distribution of food additives and drugs that will be given to animals. These include animals from which human foods are derived, as well as food additives and drugs for pet or companion animals. CVM is responsible for regulating drugs, devices, and food additives given to, or used on, over one hundred million companion animals, plus millions of poultry, cattle, swine, and minor animal species. (Minor animal species include animals other than cattle, swine, chickens, turkeys, horses, dogs, and cats.) 
The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) mission is to protect the public health through regulation of animal drugs, food additives, and devices.  This mission is accomplished through the following activities:
?	Review of new and abbreviated animal drug applications, investigational new animal drug applications and related submissions, medicated feed applications, and food additive petitions.
?	Assessment of the environmental/food safety impact of CVM regulatory decisions/actions.
?	Surveillance of marketed products through review of drug experience reports and compliance programs
?	Research programs designed to provide a scientific basis for Agency decision making.
	
	There are approximately 400 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) employees assigned to CVM, and they are organized into five offices in addition to the Office of the Center Director:
?	Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation (ONADE) - responsible for the review and approval of new and generic drug applications for the marketing and manufacture of animal drugs
?	Office of Surveillance and Compliance (OS&C) - monitors approved drugs and feeds for continued safety and effectiveness
?	Office of Research (OR) ? conducts applied research in support of current and evolving FDA regulatory issues to provide solutions that ensure the safety of animal derived food and animal health products
?	Office of Minor Use and Minor Species (OMUMS) - established in response to the Minor Use and Minor Species (MUMS) Animal Health Act of 2004, the Office declares MUMS designations (i.e. seven years of marketing exclusivity) for new animal drugs; it will add drugs to an index of legally marketed unapproved new animal drugs; and will approve grant money to assist in defraying the costs of safety and effectiveness testing expenses in the development of designated new animal drugs once final regulations providing for designation are published.
?	Office of Management (OM) - provides administrative, budget, and information resources support across all CVM activities.
	
	Most of CVM?s operations are divided between the Metro Park North 2 (MPN 2), and Metro Park North 4 (MPN 4) locations on Standish Place in Rockville, Maryland.  However, OR is located in laboratory/office space at the MOD II building located in Laurel, Maryland.
	
	
B.  OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT

<DESC>The US Postal Service is requesting proposals from companies that have proven capabilities to provide approaches to automate the movement of letter mail from input systems to final sorting systems. The input systems are primarily the Advanced Facer Canceller System (AFCS), but are not limited to the AFCS. The output systems are the Delivery Bar Code Sorters (DBCS). The AFCS separates mail into three categories, FIM (remittance) mail, local mail, and outgoing mail. Typically, each category of mail from the AFCS is sorted on a different DBCS. That is, there is one DBCS that sorts FIM mail; there is a second DBCS that sorts the local mail; and there is a third DBCS that sorts outgoing mail. 

Those companies with demonstrated technology that may be in use in the general public or for other postal administrations are asked to propose an approach that can accept as input the mail from multiple (at least 4) input systems and to distribute that mail to multiple (at least 3) output systems. The mail is to be distributed to the output systems based on delivery destination of the mail and the sort plans loaded on the output systems. Proposals will be evaluated on total cost to implement, functional risk, and performance risk. A single proposal will be selected for a field proof of concept evaluation of an engineering prototype system. The US Postal Service will provide funding for the field evaluation but not for the development of the engineering prototype. Interested suppliers must submit firm fixed price proposals for the field evaluation.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement, a market survey for written information only. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC-PC) is seeking information on shipboard fendering concepts for use on U.S. Navy Hovercraft, such as Landing Craft Air-Cushion (LCAC).  This search is restricted to current approaches or off–the-shelf systems used in the maritime environment.  NSWC-PC is interested in materials, systems and technologies that can mitigate ship contact during amphibious berthing or launching operations. The desired system will be capable of having increased reliability over current systems to levels that will increase mean time between replacements, reduce maintenance and repair, thereby increasing combat readiness and reducing life cycle maintenance costs.  The weight of the systems should be kept to a minimum, as the subject craft is very weight sensitive.  The system is required to mount to the craft freeboard and the attachment scheme should be as simple as possible.  This announcement will serve as a first step for evaluating alternatives !  and supporting research and development efforts.  Systems could be acquired in the future for Test and Evaluation or for future installation.  At this time, only current, off-the-shelf fendering systems will be considered.  It is desirable that the vendor be able to provide some experimental data concerning prior impact testing, or notional ranges of the fender’s energy absorption potential.  The impact scenarios for gauging the applicability of a system are as follows: Craft displacements of 190, 250, and 320 short tons Impact velocities of 1.3-2.0 ft/sec Responses to this announcement should include a technical description and detailed characteristics of the fendering system for use on the LCAC or similar craft.  System descriptions should have enough information for the government to make informed decisions regarding the concept’s applicability.  Information submitted shall be marked with restrictive legends as deemed appropriate by the potential vendor.  Data with restrictive markings will be handled in accordance with the restrictions thereto.   Interested parties must provide paper submittals with copies on disks in MS Word or Adobe Acrobat format.  The Government will evaluate the submittals for their potential to effectively absorb the impact energy described above.  Organizations that submit materials/designs, which are determined by the evaluation team as possessing significant potential for contributing to the solution of the fendering problem, may be provided an opportunity to demonstrate their system. Only prime contractors should respond.  A list of responding prime contractors will be furnished to potential sub-contractors upon request.  Technical questions should be directed to Mr. Rob Cole at (850) 235-5947 (email Robert.e.cole1@navy.mil ).  Mailing address for submissions is:   Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, Code E32, ATTN: Robert E. Cole, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001 or email: Robert.e.cole1@navy.mil.  Responses to this sources sought should be sent to the address stated a!  bove not later than 30 March 2007.  This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or to ultimately award a contract. NAICS 541330. FSC AC33.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center plans to procure services to support the efficient operation, high-impact utilization, and continual enhancement of NASA supercomputing resources to meet the growing, agency-wide requirements for large-scale computational modeling, simulation, and analysis, to support scientific and engineering excellence in NASA missions. The work will be performed primarily at Ames Research Center (ARC), Moffett Field, California. There could also be support at other NASA Centers during the performance period of the contract. In this synopsis, NASA ARC is soliciting information about potential sources and preferred contracting approaches for the above services, which are described in more detail in Appendix A (See separate Appendix A document posted November 21, 2005).  CURRENT CONTRACT FEATURES: The current NASA Information Technology Research, Development and Operations in Support of Scientific Computing (ITRDO) task order NNA05AC20T has the following features:  1) Period of Performance: Basic: 4/1/05 - 3/31/06; Option 1: 4/1/06 - 3/31/07. 2) Task Order Type: Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF). The task order was awarded under the General Services Administration Information Technology Omnibus Procurement II contract. I.  PURPOSE OF THIS SYNOPSIS  This notice has two purposes:  1) To request information on capabilities of potential offerors to provide the services described in Appendix A.  Information received as a result of this notice will be considered by the Government and used for acquisition planning purposes only. 2) To request information from interested parties regarding their preferred contracting approach to providing the services described in Appendix A.   >From this point forward, the follow-on procurement to the ITRDO task order will be known as the NASA Supercomputing Support Services (NS3) contract. II.  SUMMARY OF PROPOSED WORK BACKGROUND: NASA’s challenging mission to explore and understand space and the Earth within it requires the agency to assertively leverage and advance humankind’s latest capabilities, technologies, and knowledge. Supercomputing is a powerful tool for meeting the agency’s challenges. Computing capability has advanced exponentially for decades, to the point that computational modeling and simulation has become an equal partner to experiment and theory in achieving scientific and engineering progress. Supercomputing now provides broad support in solving NASA’s greatest challenges, including high-fidelity modeling to design and improve aerospace vehicles, analysis of massive Earth systems data to understand potential near-term and long-term futures of our planet, and detailed astrophysical simulations to explore the history and future of our universe. To meet these and many other mission challenges, NASA operates two major supercomputing (a.k.a. high performance computing (HPC)) facilities. NASA’s primary HPC facility is the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) Facility at Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California. NAS serves as the supercomputing pathfinder for the agency, maintaining a deep knowledge of HPC and related technologies and applications, and developing and operating some of the largest, most effective supercomputers in the world. NAS supports users from most NASA Centers, all Mission Directorates, and external organizations as well. To enable effective use of these strategic HPC resources, NAS provides integrated support to its users, including application code porting and optimization, data analysis and visualization, application pathfinding, and system engineering. The goal of this integrated support is to achieve dramatic reductions in time-to-solution, demonstrate breakthroughs in accuracy or scale of solution, and enable unprecedented rapid advances in scientific and engineering insight. NASA’s second major HPC facility is the NASA Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS) at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. NCCS leverages the pathfinding of NAS to field and operate advanced and cost-effective production supercomputers. NCCS’ user base comes primarily from the Science Mission Directorate. However, both NAS and NCCS are able to perform load-sharing or fail-over services for the other facility if necessary. The NS3 contract will support the NAS facility, its HPC projects, and its NASA-wide networking infrastructure. NS3 may also support the NCCS facility, and perhaps smaller NASA HPC facilities at other NASA Centers, during part or all of the period of performance of the contract. NASA is transforming its multi-facility supercomputing resources into a unified, strategically managed capability for the Agency. Thus, approaches are sought that support coordination, best practices sharing, and other synergies across the agency. TECHNICAL AREAS: The following lists the technical activities at the NAS and NCCS facilities that may require NS3 support during the period of performance. These activities are summarized in Appendix A. 1) Supercomputing and Storage Systems 2) Networking and Communications 3) User Services and IPT Management (IPT Management is NAS only) 4) Application Services and Tools (NAS only) 5) Visualization and Data Analysis (NAS only) 6) Pathfinding Modeling and Simulation Technologies (NAS only) 7) Facility Operations 8) NASA-Wide Architecture 9) Program Management III.  RESPONSES REGARDING POTENTIAL SOURCES STATEMENT OF CAPABILITIES Interested Offerors having the required specialized capabilities/qualifications to support some or all of the work described in Appendix A are asked to submit a capability/qualification statement of 15 PAGES or less.  The response must include the following: 1) Company name, address, point of contact, phone, fax, e-mail, and website (if applicable). 2) Whether your company is Large business, Small business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a)set-aside small business, HUBZone small business, Woman-owned small business concern, Veteran-owned Service Disabled small business, HBCU/MI, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned small business for NAISC code 541519 size standard $21 million. 3) Your company’s capability in each of the technical areas.  For each technical area, indicate what percentage of the technical area you would perform. 4) Any experience that your company has in operating or providing primary support for a major supercomputing (a.k.a. HPC or high-end computing) facility. 5) A list of relevant work performed in the past five (5) years, including contract type, contract number, technical description, dollar amount, period of performance, and a customer reference name and telephone number.  Please include relevant work in collaboration with any high performance computing organization. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses.  IV.  RESPONSES REGARDING THE CONTRACTING APPROACH The Government is soliciting contracting approaches to the NASA Supercomputing Support Services contract that will enhance competition and provide business opportunities. Therefore, the Government is requesting feedback on the following areas for consideration during acquisition planning: a) Socio-economic considerations:  ARC is interested in your comments on establishing subcontracting goals for Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned small business, Small-Disadvantaged Business, or Women-owned small business concern, Veteran-owned Service Disabled small business, Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI), and HUBZone small business.  The prior task order subcontracting goals were as follows: 	Small Business			12% 	Small Disadvantaged Business	10% 	Women-Owned Small Business	 3% 	HUBZone 			 0% 	Total Small Business Concerns	25% b) Performance-Based Contracting (PBC): ARC is interested in your comments on Performance-Based Contracting (PBC). If you have specific experience with PBC in support of similar contracts, please include your experience and opinion of measurable performance standards as it relates to the technical areas described in Appendix A.  c) Contract Period of Performance Duration:  ARC is interested in your comments on how long the total contract period of performance should be based on your ability to provide cost estimate information.  ARC is considering a contract performance period longer than five (5) years. d) Use of Cost Plus Award Fee/Award Term: ARC is considering the use of a cost plus award fee/award term structure to evaluate technical performance, schedule, and cost.   ARC is interested in motivating contractors to provide excellent performance during the life of a contract through a new incentive plan called "award term." Award term is considered a non-monetary incentive that can stand alone or be used in combination with other contract incentives.  It is a disciplined process used to determine whether to continue a longer-term business relationship with a contractor.  The award term evaluation process mirrors that of award fee; however, award term evaluations are based, to a greater extent, on objective metrics.  NASA has utilized this new contracting approach in several cases under a pilot program.  In an attempt to determine the feasibility of a cost plus award fee/award term approach for this particular procurement, the Government is soliciting input from interested parties and asks that responses include answers to the following questions:  1) Performance incentives: Please provide your view regarding award fee, award term, and/or other appropriate incentives for contractor performance. 2) Here are some sample incentive evaluation factors. How would you propose to measure factors such as the technical/cost/schedule performance, risk mitigation, employee and asset safety and security, innovative best practices, quality of service to users, extraordinary mission impacts, multi-facility synergy, bringing in new customers and users, responsiveness to changing requirements and budget, partnering with HPC vendors for new system development, or identifying opportunities for technical and administrative improvement? 3) What type of award fee evaluation factors would you recommend for this type of procurement?  4) What type award term factors would you recommend for this type of procurement? 5) Would use of an award term incentive properly motivate contractor performance on the follow-on contract and why?  6) Would you submit a proposal if a solicitation is issued for the follow-on contract with the award term incentive and why?  7) Have you had experience with Award Term Contracting? If yes, please provide the name of the Government agency who awarded the contract, the contract number, a brief description of the work, the Contracting Officer's contact information, and your perception of whether this did or did not incentivize performance.  e) Data: What type of technical information along with the Statement of Work would you like to see with a potential solicitation (e.g., sample tasks, information on the computer systems and other major resources currently being supported, best practices questions)? f) Contract Content/Structure: Do you have any suggestions or examples of restructuring, simplifications, and clarity in the description of technical areas (Appendix A) as well as other types of additional information that would improve understanding or clarity of requirements and terms and conditions? There is no limit on the page length to your response to PART IV. RESPONSES REGARDING THE CONTRACTING APPROACH. V.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice to assist NIST in completing market research for a future procurement. No solicitation is currently available, and no unsolicited proposals will be entertained as a result of this sources sought notice.  

The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program at the U.S. Department of Commerce?s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD is a nationwide network of resources transforming manufacturers to compete globally, supporting greater supply chain integration, and providing access to technology for improved productivity. MEP Centers work directly with area manufacturers to provide expertise and services tailored to their most critical needs, which range from process improvements and worker training to business practices and applications of new technology. Solutions are offered through a combination of direct assistance from Center staff and outside consultants. 

The MEP system of Centers and field offices in all fifty states and Puerto Rico is funded by federal, state, local and private resources to provide these services to manufacturers. The centers provide a mechanism to integrate federal and state public policy goals, responding to market forces and addressing the needs of individual manufacturers. To make the most of this partnership, NIST MEP strives to balance the priorities of U.S. national policy with those of state partners to create a robust and effective program providing U.S. manufacturers with the tools they need to grow and remain globally competitive. Given the unique nature of the MEP network, success depends on the understanding and alignment of state policy goals and objectives with national policy to create a partnership that leverages the strength of each entity.  

NIST MEP seeks information on potential sources with experience and current expertise in the following areas: professional relationships with state science and technology and economic development agencies and leadership in most or all 50 states; understanding of current trends in state science and technology and economic development policy; familiarity with current trends in state science and technology agencies and economic development research, development, and investments to promote technology transfer and economic growth; understanding of state and local agency priorities as they support technology-based economic development; familiarity with NIST MEP?s ?next generation? strategy (dated 3/6/06) with its increased focus on innovation and technology diffusion; and knowledge of manufacturing extension programs and their relationships to state science and technology and economic development priorities.

Companies that currently possess such capability and have prior experience providing services using this expertise are encouraged to respond to this notice and provide the following information by email to JLDavis@nist.gov no later than March 27, 2007:

<SUBJECT>A -- Research Service for Implementing High-Frequency Hedonics in the CPI
<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics intends to enter into a sole source contract under Simplified Acquisition Procedures with Professor Ariel Pakes, 215 Brattle Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138-3346 to provide marketing research services for a new method of quality-change filtering to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  CPI currently estimates at most one hedonic regression a year for each product in order to filter product-quality change from monthly price indexes that are meant to measure only price change.  Infrequent re-estimation of hedonic regressions reduces index accuracy because the estimated regressions obsolesce rapidly, but more frequent estimations have been prohibitively costly.  A new method, derived in the context of very simple research indexes, permits monthly re-estimation at low cost by drastically reducing the amount of data verification needed.  This method in principle can be implemented in the much more complex environment of the CPI, but numerous obstacles stemming from this complexity must be overcome.  Innovative research addressing these problems is needed. 

The BLS is initiating a research contract for such research, in the context of the CPI sub index for television.  This category of good has much in common with other technologically changing items, so what is learned from TV should provide guidance more generally.  For this research the BLS is seeking a contractor whose innovations in econometrics and quality-adjustment have been recognized by the economics profession as being of the highest caliber.  The contractor must also be familiar with the intricacies of the construction of the CPI.

Professor Pakes has previously completed three contracts for BLS on evaluating alternative quality adjustment techniques for the CPI, with the paper from his earliest contract eventually being published in the American Economic Review, the world?s leading general economics journal.  He is therefore very familiar with the methods and intricacies of the CPI. 
 
  Total cost for this requirement will NTE $3,000.00

This notice of intent is not a request for offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement is solely within the discretion of the Government. There is no RFP notice. For Information Purposes Only

<SUBJECT>--Notice of Intent to Award Phase II of Sole Source Contract to Tufpak, Inc. of Ossipee, NH
<DESC>The US Army Natick Soldier Center (NSC) intends to award a Sole Source contract to Tufpak, Inc., Ossipee, NH, for specific adaptations to commercial machinery that is used to manufacture anhydride ration heater bags for Meals, Ready-To-Eat (MREs).  T he adaptations will involve improving manufacturability and operational usability and are intended to lead to a more economically produced product that can be manufactured commercially by multiple vendors. This is the second phase of this effort.  The firs t phase was worth $141,000; the proposed second (and final phase) will cost approximately $70,000 over four months and focus on heater bag width and stiffness and strength.  The rationale for other than full and open competition is that Tufpak, Inc. is the  only vendor currently capable of integrating the Hydrogen-Free Ration Heater (HRH) with the uniquely manufactured heater bag that that meets all military requirements. Tufpak currently owns both the proprietary formulation of the film currently used in th e HRH heater bag and the unique film extrusion manufacturing capability that is necessary to make the HRH heater bag.  This unique material and manufacturing capability is required to make a product that meets military requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all comments received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of a quoter's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information.

When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the quoter as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the quoter's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the quoter's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the quoter's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the quoter's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the quoter's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the quoter's performance.

The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the quoter.

Award will be made by which quoter offers the best value to the Government based on price and the above technical criteria.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(End of provision) 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2)  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity?s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer).

DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

NOTE:  All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database to receive an award.  Information on registration may be obtained calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the internet at www.bpn.gov.

All proposals shall be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:  Technical Capability, Past Performance and Price.  Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.  Provide the following in formation with your offer:  1. Technical Capability.  If providing an equal, please comply with FAR Clause 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal.   Explain how your companys product meets the Salient Characteristics specified above and how your company will compl y with the requirements.  NOTE: Statements that the offeror understands, can or will comply with all specifications, or statements paraphrasing the specifications or parts thereof, or phrases such as standard procedures will be used or well known technique s will be used will be considered insufficient. Insufficient explanations of how your company will comply with the above of this solicitation may cause your quote to receive a MARGINAL or UNSATISFACTORY rating. 2. Past Performance. Vendors are required to provide Past Performance Questionnaires to two firms/entities for which they are currently or have recently provided the same or similar supplies and/or equipment. Provide with your quote, the company names, telephone numbers, and points of contact that will provide the completed questionnaires for your quote. If a v endor provides more than two past performance references, the Contracting Officer will consider only the first two listed references in the award decision. It is the vendors responsibility to ensure past performance references submit completed questionnai res directly to the Great Plains Regional Contracting Office by the solicitation closing date and time. The Contracting Officer may also consider any additional past performance information that is available to the Government. Vendors are reminded that whi le the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing thorough and complete past performance information rests with the vendor. 3. Price.  Evaluation Process: All quotes will be evaluated in accordance with the f ollowing criteria: 1. Each vendor will be evaluated on its overall Past Performance under existing or prior contracts for the same or similar item as well as Technical Capability.  Pricing will be evaluated to determine value offered for the price and the  extent to which it is fair and reasonable in terms of the Governments requirement. The Government reserves the right to evaluate quoted prices on the basis of price realism and will consider quoted prices as an indication of understanding the scope and c omplexity of the Governments requirement. 2. The award decision will be based on the Best Value offered to the Government and not solely on price and price related factors. In making the award decision, the Contracting Officer will consider the evaluated rating of all factors. 3. Technical Capability and Past Performance are equal in importance. Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.  Price could become the determinative selection factor if th e quality of quotes is determined to be essentially equal, or if a quote deemed superior in technical quality is determined not to be worth the high price premium. The trade-off between technical merit and price could result in awarding to other than the l ow offeror.

DINFOS has a requirement for Nikon camera parts and compatible accessories to support their mission of establishing training classes and providing required training to field units that currently utilize Nikon cameras.  Purchase of any other cameras would not allow DINFOS to provide the necessary training to their customers.         

3.  Description of the supplies and services.  The vendor shall provide 130 ea Nikon D200 digital cameras outfitted with Nikkor 2162 lens, 120ea Nikon SB800 flash, 120ea. Nikon EN-EL3E battery, 120ea Quantum MKZ3 cable and 130ea Tiffen UVP67 UV filters.

The camera equipment currently used by DINFOS customers are predominately Nikon cameras and accessories which are either identical to or compatible with the equipment which is the subject of this justification  DINFOS must be able to support effective training for those units currently using these Nikon cameras.  The purchase of any other manufacturer?s camera would not allow DINFOS to provide the required customer training.

6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.  In accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1), a notice of intent to issue a contract for brand name items will be published on the Federal Business Opportunities website.

requirement is dependent upon the make and brand of camera equipment being utilized by current customers of DINFOS.

None.

10.  Listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.  None
