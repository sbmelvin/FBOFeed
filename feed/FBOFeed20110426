<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to extend contract NNA05BE28C with Science ApplicationsInternational Corporation (SAIC) on a sole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1),Only One Responsible Source. The performance period will be extended for a potentialtwelve month period, consisting of a nine month base period, and three one-month options.The principle purpose of this contract is to provide support for the NASA Ames ResearchSimulation Laboratory Facilities (SimLabs).  The SimLabs are unique national research anddevelopment facilities dedicated to providing researchers with high-fidelity environmentsin which to conduct simulated flight research and to advance the state-of-the-art ofsimulation technology.	Researchers use the SimLabs facilities to investigate a varietyof topics ranging from the design of new aircraft guidance and control systems to thehuman factors implications of new or existing flight deck displays, airspace operations,air traffic control and automation. In-house projects and experiments are conducted todevelop new simulator systems and subsystems, improve simulation systems, developadvanced engineering techniques to improve the fidelity and validity	   of simulationprograms, and incorporate the latest technology into simulation systems.  The SimulationLaboratory Facilities are primarily comprised of the Crew-Vehicle Systems ResearchFacility (CVSRF), the Vertical Motion Simulation Complex (VMSC) and FutureFlight Central(FFC).The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract, NNA05BE28C,for nine (9) months from June 30, 2011 through March 31, 2012 for the base period; andthrough June 30, 2012 if all three one-month options are exercised. The extension willincrease the current contract value. The extension is the Governments best interest toprovide ongoing SimLabs services until a new contract is awarded. The current Contractor,SAIC, is considered the only Contractor that can meet ARCs needs given the short periodof performance for the extension. Awarding the potential twelve month contract to anotherContractor at the same time the recompete is in the process would result in substantialduplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered throughcompetition of the extension as well as unacceptable delays in fulfilling ARCs criticalrequirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intendsto solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Thepurpose of this action is to bridge the performance period between the end of the currentcontract and the anticipated award of the follow-on requirement.  Information regardingthe recompetion of SimLabs II can be found at the following website: http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/synopsis.cgi?acqid=145919       .The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:30pm PDT on Monday,May 16, 2011. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purposeof determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Adetermination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The installation Ombudsman is: Deborah L.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences, intends to award a sole source contract to Borgwaldt KC, 7741 Whitepine Road, Richmond, VA 23237for the purchase of a RM 20 H smoking machine.<br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is four months.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The RM 20 H 20-port rotary smoking machine is the leader in rotary smoking machine technology. This smoking machine has two design features that make it superior to the current competition. The first design feature is that it will automatically load the cigarettes into the individual ports, reducing operator involvement and error in loading. Additionally, the smoking machine is enclosed in a chamber to limit operator exposure during smoking. Competitor rotary machines do not have auto-loading functionality or integrated enclosures.</p>
<p>The RM 20 H smoking machine automatically loads the cigarettes into the individual ports. Borgwaldt is the only company that sells the RM 20 H. It is a proprietary smoking machine. This is the only smoking machine that automatically loads the cigarettes and is the only smoking machine capable of meeting our requirements.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Borgwaldt KC. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 94992 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN April 11, 2011. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with Section 3.2.2.4 of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS), the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis for the FAA's decision to contract on a single source basis.The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with Evans Consoles, Inc. in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes to acquire, under single source procedures, a new optional use Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with Evans Consoles, Inc. to provide engineering/design, manufacturing, and installation of cab consoles utilizing a slatwall equipment mounting system configuration for Air Traffic Control Tower use.  Services under this contract will include the layout of the cab consoles, utilizing a slatwall equipment mounting system configuration, design modifications as required to previously designed mounting hardware, where needed custom design of mounting hardware, manufacturing of all consoles, slatwall and mounting hardware, demolition of existing consoles if required, installation of new consoles and mounting hardware, and provide service and maintenance repairs.  The FAA contemplates awarding a contract with a period of performance of a base year with 2 option years for an estimated amount of $9.5M.   Delivery will be on a task order basis. The contract will include a 365 calendar day base contract period and up to two (2) option periods of the same length.  Between the spring of 2005 and the fall of 2006, the FAA procured and tested off the shelf equipment mounting assemblies from Hergo, Innovative Office Products and Strongarm and found all of the products did not meet the operational and durability requirements of the FAA.  Several firms were approached about custom designing products for the FAA, and all firms declined because of limited market potential.  Evans Consoles, Inc. was the only firm interested in developing the slatwall concept for the FAA's use.  The design of the new slatwall style consoles has a significantly smaller foot print which will allow older, smaller cabs to extend the lifespan by freeing up more floor space while mounting more equipment in less space.  Evans Consoles has developed a staff to include a licensed Professional Engineer, Project Managers, designers and factory trained installers.  Use of Evans factory trained installers assures the FAA impacts to the facility will be minimized because of knowledge of the product, ability to troubleshoot and experience with design personnel.  The most recent acquisition of a comparable nature shows that interest for this type of acquisition is limited to this firm. A fair and reasonable price will be negotiated by FAA with Evans Consoles, Inc. for all deliverables under this acquisition.A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  Any questions regarding this announcement must be directed to Melody McGovern, Contracting Officer, by 4:00 PM Central Time, May 3, 2011, via email at melody.mcgovern@faa.gov.

<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) in Seattle, WA has a requirement for a vessel to conduct the biennial Continental Slope Bottom Trawl Survey of groundfish resources in the Gulf of Alaska and Eastern Bering Sea.
<p>This requirement is for a chartered fishing vessel to conduct the continental slope portion of the 2011 Gulf of Alaska biennial bottom trawl survey, in coordination with two other charter vessels that will conduct the major portion of the bottom trawl survey that covers the continental shelf.</p>
<p>Objective: Provide a safe, comfortable, and capable platform to conduct the surveys in order to continue to deliver (1) annual quantitative estimates of groundfish and crab biomass and population size and (2) biological, habitat, oceanographic, and acoustic data for the continental slope areas of the eastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. This work is conducted under the auspices of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006, first enacted in 1979 and amended in 1996, as needed for setting annual harvest levels for groundfish and crab stocks. Project performance is determined by the successful completion of each charter necessary for generation of up-to-date estimates of biomass, abundance, distribution, and population structure of groundfish and crab populations for inclusion in stock assessment analyses and ecosystem forecast model efforts.</p>
<p>The survey period consists of twenty-five (25) base charter days with an option for fifteen (15) additional charter days. The charter is scheduled to begin on/about June 1, 2011, but no later than July 1, 2011. Optional days, if exercised, shall begin immediately following the base days of the charter.</p>
<p>The vessel shall have been actively used for commercial trawling or research where trawl gear was used in the past 12 months prior to charter operations. A minimum continuous output from the main engine of 1000HP is required as well as fuel capacity to allow continuous survey operations over the entire charter period. Vessel must be able to maintain a minimum cruising speed of 16.5 km/hr (9 nm/hr) in low sea states. Vessel must be completely rigged for bottom trawling operations including a stern ramp and gallows or gantry, net reel with capacity for one 27.4/36.5 m (90/120 ft) Poly'NorEastern bottom trawl equipped with roller gear, split trawl winches holding 2.53 cm- (1 in-) diameter die-formed steel-core trawl cable in good condition and free of signs of excessive wear (frayed, burrs, broken strands, corrosion). A minimum of 1,830 m (1,000 fm) trawl cable available for fishing on each drum (not total capacity). Berthing space for up to six scientists, which may include males and females, is required.</p>
<p>The proposed contract is set-aside for small business concerns. The NAICS code for this procurement is 483114 and the size standard is 500 employees. Any vendor desiring to be considered for award must be registered in CCR and ORCA using this NAICS code. Any resulting contract will be awarded as a firm-fixed price contract.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWCPCD), Panama City, Florida intends to solicit TriCircle Company, 5850 LaChateau Place, Tucker, GA 30084-1985 on a sole source basis to investigate the role of shape features in the detection of underwater objects.  Geometrical representations of objects boundaries that allow a projective shape analysis of curves will be derived.  The method will be invariant to the viewing angle, imaging distance and boundary parameterizations.  In addition to the past challenges of infinite-dimensionality and nonlinearity of shape spaces, projective transformation as a shape-preserving transformation in the analysis will be included.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation Maritime Systems (Northrop), 1070 Seminole Trail, Charlottesville, VA 22901 for two (2) radar scan converter cards, P/N: 4803893-1. This purchase is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. Northrop is the designer and original equipment manufacturer of these cards. The Radar Scan Converter Card is directly coupled with the Radar Electronics Unit (EU) and Turning Unit (TU) used in the LCAC.  Both the EU and the TU are supplied solely by Northrop. Replacing P/N 4803893-1 by using a different vendor will be cost prohibitive since it will require extensive modifications to the LCACs navigation system.
 Northrop is the cataloged Source of Supply in the Navy Supply System for these items. Currently, Northrop is the only vendor for these specific part numbered items, that meets form, fit and function requirements. The Department of Defense will no longer award contracts to contractors not registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  Registration may be accomplished by accessing the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov/. Anticipated award date will be on or about 05/02/11. Delivery will be to the Receiving Office, Naval Support Activity-Panama City (NSA-PC), Building 100, 101 Vernon Ave, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.

<DESC><p>The United States Agency for International Development, Regional Services Center (RSC), Budapest, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of its client Mission, USAID Macedonia, in anticipation of the procurement of a cost plus fixed fee completion contract that will implement a four year project entitled the Regional Small Business Development (RSBD) Project to be implemented in Macedonia. <br />The Project will strengthen private sector capacity to drive regional economic development and job creation in selected regions. This goal will be achieved through:<br />a) Engaging business leaders, local government and other institutions to identify market opportunities for growth and job creation;<br />b) Upgrading the capacity of micro, small and medium enterprises to respond to new market opportunities and grow;<br />c) Strengthening the capacity of business service providers to better identify and serve the needs of the MSMEs;<br />d) Building the necessary workforce capacity to support the growth of the MSMEs; <br />e) Encouraging women and youth participation in business.<br />The core idea underlying the RSBD Project is to identify and implement regional business initiatives leading toward job creation, based on identified market opportunities, and develop action plans to exploit those. The regional entrepreneurs (both aspiring and existing) will be mobilized to take advantage of these opportunities while support will be provided to help them succeed, such as the services of local business service providers and business connections they need. <br />The RSBD Project will employ the large pool of available enterprise development tools (value chain development, cluster strategies, development of business services, etc.) to link the identified opportunities to interested enterprises-medium, small, micro-as the opportunities will vary greatly in size and complexity. This may include activities such as forging cooperation between microenterprises to reduce costs, helping small businesses set up new points of sale in untapped areas, and helping medium-sized lead firms develop their supply chain by upgrading small producers. Interventions will be based on specific and real market opportunities.<br />Rather than becoming a direct service provider, the project will play a proactive facilitative role bringing together different types of service providers, micro-lending institutions, government institutions, business support organizations, schools and other relevant members of the MSME support network, and fulfil important catalysing functions that are not currently performed by the existing business support structures or regional economic development institutions.<br />The RSBD Project will facilitate appropriate technical and/or soft skills training when needed, and upgrade the business management skills of owners and operators of SMEs and microenterprise start-ups. This project will cooperate closely with the Youth Employment Skills Project (YES) to communicate the identified skill gaps to the formal education system.<br />The project will set aside $1 million in a Special Activities Fund (SAF) to issue bids for services, co-finance the delivery of business services and training and other measures designed to "buy-down" the risk of investment by entrepreneurs in new ventures or expansions with the potential to create many jobs. This fund could also be used to cost-share technology acquisition or advisory services.<br />The Regional Small Business Development Project will be implemented in three regions in Macedonia (Polog, Pelagonija and one from the eastern part of Macedonia to be determined later).<br />More background information and reference materials can be located at: http://macedonia.usaid.gov under "Documents and Reports".</p>
<p>This will be a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. Interested firms can register and use the Interested Vendor List (IVL) on the FedBizOpps page: http://www2.fbo.gov/EPSVendorsManual/VG6-Interest.html, so that firms can contact one another for consideration of teaming arrangements and/or small business subcontracting opportunities in response to this solicitation. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541990. The small business size standard is $7 million.<br />In accordance with FAR 5.102(d) availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. The solicitation will be posted herewith at FEDBIZOPPS web page (www.fedbizopps.gov) on or about May 20, 2011 or not less than fifteen (15) days after this notice is issued. <br />Please do not contact USAID/Macedonia. All communication must be through this office. Questions must be directed to Ms. Szidonia Szekeres and Mr. Clement J Bucher, U.S. Agency for International Development, email: sszekeres@usaid.gov, cbucher@usaid.gov.<br />We anticipate making one direct award for the implementation of this project. The release of this notice in no way obligates USAID or the US Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.</p>

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development, Regional Services Center (RSC), Budapest, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of its client Mission, USAID Macedonia, in anticipation of the procurement of a cost plus fixed fee completion contract that will implement a three-year project entitled Judicial Strengthening Project to be implemented in Macedonia.
<p>Guided by the overarching objective of strengthening the role of the judiciary in the separation of powers, USAID Macedonia's new Judicial Strengthening Project will seek to: (1) develop broad based support for rule of law and judicial sector reform; (2) improve the independence of the judiciary and its systems; (3) foster efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of the courts, and (4) increase citizen trust and confidence in the integrity of the judicial branch.</p>
<p>The Judicial Strengthening Project will build upon USAID's prior activities to advance the rule of law in Macedonia. The project will support the judiciary to improve its independence and independence of its systems. The focus will be on the establishment of effective and independent governance systems and structures, building leadership and management capacities, and on increasing the role of the judiciary in the development of laws, regulations and policies governing the branch. Additionally, the project will help courts in improving impartiality, fairness and efficiency in the administration of justice, as well as in providing quality and professional services. The achievement of these goals will be of key importance and is expected to lead to an increased citizen's trust in the judiciary. Opening the courts to the public and making court operations transparent will be another important step in improving public perception of and confidence in the court system. The Judicial Strengthening Project will also support capacity building of justice sector professional associations and civil society organizations so they can take active participation in the judicial reforms. Their engagement in advocacy and monitoring activities is expected to build demand and support for improved independence, efficiency and accountability of the judiciary.</p>
<p>This will be a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. Interested firms can register and use the Interested Vendor List (IVL) on the FedBizOpps page: http://www2.fbo.gov/EPSVendorsManual/VG6-Interest.html, so that firms can contact one another for consideration of teaming arrangements and/or small business subcontracting opportunities in response to this solicitation. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541990. The small business size standard is $7 million.<br />In accordance with FAR 5.102(d) availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. The solicitation will be posted herewith at FEDBIZOPPS web page (www.fedbizopps.gov) on or about May 20, 2011 or not less than fifteen (15) days after this notice is issued. <br />Please do not contact USAID/Macedonia. All communication must be through this office. Questions must be directed to Ms. Szidonia Szekeres and Mr. Clement J Bucher, U.S. Agency for International Development, email: sszekeres@usaid.gov, cbucher@usaid.gov.<br />We anticipate making one direct award for the implementation of this project. The release of this notice in no way obligates USAID or the US Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The company must regularly slaughter grain-fed beef and process carcasses into vacuum-packaged boxed beef.  The company must regularly process enough U.S. Choice and U.S. Select carcasses to facilitate the completion of cut selection and fabrication in one day.  The experimental protocol requires obtaining the gluteus medius and triceps brachii from the right side of 300 U.S. Choice and 300 U.S. Select carcasses at 24 to 48 postmortem.  Therefore, the packing company must regularly produce cap-off center-cut, boneless top sirloins (NAMP 184B) and trimmed beef shoulder clods with the infraspinatus removed (modified NAMP 114C).  The packing company must allow MARC personnel access to their facility and provide sufficient space for product tagging between fabrication and vacuum-packaging.  The packing company must have facilities for segregation of the vacuum-packaged cuts into combo bins for immediate transport to the Meat Animal Research Center.  To facilitate completion of the experiment, the plant must be located with 120 miles of Clay Center, Nebraska. Cut selection and procurement will be conducted on June 22nd, 2005.

<RESPDATE>052511
<CONTACT>Robert P. Goeke, Contracts Manager , Phone 9372553659, Email robert.goeke@wpafb.af.mil - Michael Culhane, Program Manager, Phone 9379045055, Email michael.culhane@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the government to acquire any product or services. It does not guarantee a subsequent solicitation will be issued. Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary, and costs associated with any submission shall not be reimbursed by the Government. The information requested will be used by the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) to facilitate decision making.
<p>The Air Force Medical Service Commodity Council (AFMSCC) is seeking sources and relevant data to strategically procure temporary medical staffing (TMS) services in military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) at geographically-dispersed Air Force installations in the 50 United States and its territories. The work will supplement clinical services provided by DoD military personnel, DoD civilian employees, or other contract staff. The mission of the AFMSCC is to strategically acquire AFMS requirements by defining common specifications and leveraging resources.</p>
<p>The Government has not reached a firm definition of the time period for temporary medical staffing and seeks input to determine how best to align its requirements with industry capabilities. Currently the Government has temporary requirements for less than a month, but that do not exceed 364 days. The majority of the requirements are in the 180-210 day range. Our requirements are in the area of Clinical Support Services.</p>
<p>Clinical Support Services can be any occupation that engages in direct patient care activities such as physicians, nurses, medical technicians, pharmacists and laboratory professionals. They will be sought to meet temporary staffing needs. <br />In accordance with DFARS 237.104, agencies may acquire personal services contracts for health care as authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1091 include the following: <br />(1) Direct health care services provided in medical treatment facilities; <br />(2) Health care services at locations outside of medical treatment facilities (such as the provision of medical screening examinations at military entrance processing stations); and<br />(3) Services of clinical counselors, family advocacy program staff, and victim's services representatives to members of the Armed Forces and covered beneficiaries who require such services, provided in medical treatment facilities or elsewhere. Persons with whom a personal services contract may be entered into under this authority include clinical social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and other comparable professionals who have advanced degrees in counseling or related academic disciplines and who meet all requirements for State licensure and board certification requirements, if any, within their fields of specialization.<br />Currently, these services are typically procured, when needed, by each facility using; a local base contracting office, other contracting offices at other bases, centralized contracts, and other non-agency contracts. By leveraging resources, defining common requirements and specifications, we will simplify the acquisition process and reduce the lead time in the ordering process for the requesting location. There has not been any determination concerning the number, scope and geographic coverage of requirements associated with this area of interest.</p>
<p>The AFMSCC seeks to learn from industry the unique aspects or procedures mandated for recruiting, placing and retaining clinical support services to meet temporary staffing needs across the AFMS. Preliminary research suggests that the scope of the contracts might exceed the capabilities of small business; however, we seek large and small business respondents who are currently conducting business or providing similar services. The input will help us ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity of all potential offerors. Reviews of available North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) codes/ spend (3 year average annual receipts) suggest these are potential classifications:</p>
<p>&bull; 561311 - Employment Placement Agencies/$7M<br />&bull; 561320 - Temporary Help Services/$13.5M<br />&bull; 621111 - Office of Physicians/$10M<br />&bull; 621112 - Office of Physicians, Mental Health Specialists/$10M<br />&bull; 621210 - Office of Dentists/ $7M<br />&bull; 621330 - Office of Mental Health Practitioners, except Physicians/$7M<br />&bull; 621399 - Office of All Other Miscellaneous Health Practitioners/$7M<br />&bull; 621493 - Freestanding Ambulatory Surgical and Emergency Centers/$10M<br />&bull; 621999 - All Other Miscellaneous Ambulatory Health Care Services/$10M<br />&bull; 622110 - General Medical and Surgical Hospitals/$34.5M</p>
<p>We are seeking comments on our NAICS code selection as well.</p>
<p>If you are an interested large or small business, please complete the attached questionnaire http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CL6JRY7 . Completing this survey will provide the name, phone number, and e-mail address of a company representative that the Government may contact for additional information.</p>
<p>Notice: The Air Force has non-government employees (i.e. contractor employees) assisting with its market research. These non-government employees, who have all signed nondisclosure agreements, will have access to industry responses.</p>
<p>Information gained through this RFI will be used to further define the AFMS requirements. Individual capability briefs will not be accepted at this time. Interested parties are urged to monitor the official Government Point of Entry at www.fedbizopps.gov for future announcements regarding AFMS needs. It is the responsibility of interested parties to check this site regularly for any changes or updates. Vendors can subscribe to the FedBizOpps Vendor Notification Service to receive emails notifying them of all notices for a particular solicitation number, all notices from selected organizations and product service classifications (NAICS codes) or all procurement notices. To register for this service, click on "Vendor Notification Service" at the FedBizOpps home page. Then click on the subscription option desired and follow the instructions. This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification. Subscribers to this list service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the Federal Business Opportunities site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions.</p>
<p>Please note that the government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI.</p>
<p><br />Please complete the survey no later than 25 May 2011 and address any questions with the listed&nbsp;POCs.</p>

<p>The Health and Human Services Department-Food and Drug Administration is seeking to find small business contractors who can provide a Microbioreactor system.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish the Government's mission, the system must meet or exceed the following minimum performance specifications:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Minimum Performance Specifications Micro bioreactor system</strong></span></p>
<p>General</p>
<p>&bull;The system should have a compact bench-top design to fit the space constraints of the laboratory and be of open architecture sample introduction area.</p>
<p>&bull;The instrument should be delivered with all necessary supplies and accessories required for the installation and start-up. The Contractor must be able to perform installation of the system and must be able to provide training on how to operate.</p>
<p>&bull;The system should have all accessories required to run a cell culture based experiment.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific requirements</span></p>
<p>&bull;Provides parallel processing, control and evaluation of at least 24 bioreactors</p>
<p>&bull;Online monitoring and closed loop control of pH and DO</p>
<p>&bull;Independent control of O2 and CO2 for each vessel</p>
<p>&bull;Full control of impeller speed and bioreactor</p>
<p>&bull;Sparge tube or a facility to deliver gas to the impeller mixing zone</p>
<p>&bull;Control of reactor liquid temperature</p>
<p>&bull;Approximate culture volume of 10 to 15ml should provide for a sample port to allow addition of reagents / feeds or removal of samples</p>
<p>&bull;Allows viable cell counts via automated delivery of samples to a cell counter and incorporation of data in an integrated manner</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aseptic operation of the micro bioreactor system</span></p>
<p>The parallel micro bioreactor system should be operable in an aseptic condition throughout the experiment either by design or by housing in an aseptic cell culture cabinet/hood. In the case where it is housed in an aseptic cell culture cabinet, the cabinet is integral to the system.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Measurement of viable cell count</span></p>
<p>The parallel micro bioreactor system should provide viable cell density (VCD) data throughout the experimental run integrally. If the system uses an additional cell counter instrument for generating VCD data, then the cell counter is integral to the micro bioreactor system.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data system</span></p>
<p>&bull;The instrument should come with the software for data acquisition, processing and reporting. An appropriate computer can be included.</p>
<p>&bull;Data must be displayed in real time to monitor transient signals generated during the bioreactor runs.</p>
<p>&bull;A "snapshot function" would be a plus; this feature will allow the data handling on a signal while an experiment is running. In addition to the snapshot function, if for some reason the run is manually or otherwise stopped, the partial run must also be saved and available for data analysis.</p>
<p><br />If you are a small business concern under NAICS CODE 334516-Analytical Lab Instrument Manufacturing, with a small business size standard of 500 employees, and believe that your firm would be able to provide a qualifying product, please submit information in writing via e-mail to aaron.glazier@fda.hhs.gov The vendor should include information about the company, as well as the product that meets or exceeds all of the aforementioned performance specifications.</p>
<p>Responses to this sources sought announcement will assist the Government in determining whether or not an actual future requirement similar to this one should be set aside for small business or made available to full and open competition.</p>
<p>The DEADLINE for receiving responses is 4:00 p.m. Central Time, 3 May 2011. Responses received after the deadline or without the required information shall be considered unacceptable and will not be considered. Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters will be issued to the participants.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />EMPLOYMENT VERIFICATION SERVICES<br />OFFICE OF WORKERS COMPENSATION PROGRAMS
<p>RFI Number: DOL111RI21249<br />Notice Type: Request for Information</p>
<p>SYNOPSIS</p>
<p>The United States Department of Labor (DOL) is conducting market research for an upcoming procurement requirement. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to provide the United States Department of Labor's (DOL) Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation (DEEOIC) requirement for Employment Verification services.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this request is 541612, Human Resources Consulting Services. The Small Business Size is $7 Million.</p>
<p>SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. Include whether or not you are a small business; HUBZone small business; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small business; women-owned small business; or small disadvantaged business in order to assist the government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION<br />The DOL, OWCP, Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation (DEEOIC) requires services that researches and provides employment information for construction workers or other trades in which the DOL is unable to verify employment by other means. <br />BACKGROUND<br />Public Law 106-398, the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA) of 2000, as amended (the Act), established a program to compensate nuclear weapons program workers who suffered adverse health effects from exposure to beryllium, ionizing radiation, and other hazards in the course of their nuclear weapons program-related work. The President, in an Executive Order dated December 7, 2000, assigned program implementation responsibilities to various executive departments. The Fiscal Year 2005 National Defense Authorization Act, signed by President Bush on October 28, 2004, abolished Part D of the EEOICPA administered by the Department of Energy (DOE) and replaced it with a new system of federal payments called Part E to be administered by the Department of Labor (DOL). <br />The DOL's Office of Workers Compensation Programs (OWCP), Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation (DEEOIC) is responsible for adjudicating claims associated with Part B and Part E of the Act. According to 20 CFR &sect;30.105 under the DOL EEOICPA Regulations, the DOE has the responsibility for verifying employment at a covered DOE facility per EEOICPA.<br />The DOL verification process includes: (1) establishing that a contractual relationship existed between the covered facility and the identified employer (contractor); (2) verifying that the claimant was an employee of a covered employer during a specific time period; and (3) placing the claimant on site at the covered facility. <br />Occasionally, DOE or the corporate verifier does not have records sufficient to verify employment. Therefore, it becomes necessary for DOL to search other resources for verification. Alternative methods for employment verification include: the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) electronic database, the claimant's personal records, the Social Security Administration, affidavits from former co-workers of the claimant and union records. <br />The DOL receives claims from many employees who worked in jobs related to construction or trades (e.g. construction workers, electricians, plumbers, etc.). Due to these types of jobs usually being associated with a subcontract, employment is extremely difficult to verify using the DOL current resources. Hence, DOL has found the use of union records to be a tremendous assistance in the verification process. Some contractors have access to relevant union, pension, or other records that could assist the DOL in the verification of employment.</p>
<p>INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED / QUESTIONS</p>
<p>Interested contractors responding to this Request for Information (RFI) will be required to indicate their ability to fulfill all the requirements that are stipulated below:</p>
<p>1. Demonstrate your extensive institutional knowledge of the current and historical operations performed by the Department of Energy (DOE) worksites - the work performed, the occupations related to construction or trade and the time period the contractors/subcontractors were on site. Please provide a summary of your knowledge.</p>
<p>2. Are you familiar with the DOE medical screening programs, and the records they may have? If yes, please describe your knowledge of the screening programs and their records.</p>
<p>3. Do you have access to union records such as pension funds, health and welfare funds, and dispatch records? If yes, please explain.</p>
<p>4. What would be your approach for identifying new and untapped information sources for relevant union pension, health and welfare funds, or dispatch records?</p>
<p>5. Demonstrate your ability to develop and maintain an electronic process for tracking data as it pertains to contractor/subcontractor relationships with DOE.</p>
<p>6. Demonstrate your knowledge of the contractual relationships between the DOE and contractor/subcontractors. Please provide examples.</p>
<p>7. Describe your familiarity with the organizations that represent workers linked to the atomic weapons design, production, or testing.</p>
<p>8. Explain how you would foster a working relationships with local union officials or other worker representatives that may be privy to documentation or other records used to verify a worker's presence at a job site where atomic weapons design, production or testing occurred.</p>
<p>9. What steps would be taken to ensure that records or other information obtained from union organizations or other worker representatives is an accurate and unaltered report of information?</p>

The structure is to be erected twice a year, in spring and fall, adding an additional 10,000 square feet of sheltered space and containing a total volume of 1,250,000 cubic feet (35,600 cubic meters) of pressurized air. The main volume of the enclosure rises through the courtyard of the existing building and projects above the Hirshhorn approximately 70'-0". Its form is shaped by a series of belts that constrict the membrane, keeping it away from the inner wall of the courtyard. The membrane is held in place by a continuous ballast at its base, and by a steel ring supported by 24 steel cantilevers anchored to the roof. A plywood platform on a space frame forms the floor, raising it off the plaza to span across an existing fountain. The existing building sits 14ft off the ground, resting on 4 large pillars. A 2,500 square foot extension of the SIP appears to ooze under this outdoor space and into the plaza on the west side of the building. When not in use, the fabric membrane structure shall be stored offsite. It will be brought to the courtyard, unfurled, and inflated. Installation and dismantling must leave no visible trace on the building or the plaza.</p>

<DESC>RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS AT NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The Government is requesting information regarding renewable energy projects available at no cost to the Government.  
The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain capabilities for planning purposes. Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  
Information received in response to this RFI will be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 15.207(b); nevertheless, submitters must properly mark their response in accordance with FAR 15.215-1(e) if it contains information the submitter does not want disclosed to the public for any purpose.
  
Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Responders are solely responsible for all expense associated with responding to this RFI.  
Interested parties should reply no later than 06 May, 2011 to:

Brian Jackson, Contract Specialist
Brian.jackson@usmc.mil

On 5 Oct 2009, the President of the U.S. signed Executive Order 13423, which requires federal agencies to reduce diversion of non-hazardous waste to landfills by 50% by 2015 and reduce fleet petroleum use by 30% by 2020.  On 14 October 2010, the Secretary of the Navy issued energy goals for facilities under his cognizance, requiring that 50% of shore based energy be generated from renewable sources by 2020.  Installations are required to program (request budgetary authority to acquire) projects that reduce energy intensity and divert waste from landfills, as well as develop renewable energy resources in order to meet this goal.
However, there is currently no funding available to pursue these executive and legislative mandates.
  
To comply with these required energy conservation, efficiency and renewable mandates, Camp Pendleton is exploring all possibilities in the renewable energy project arena.  Due to the lack of funding, the only projects we are able to consider for immediate implementation are those from offerors who are willing and able to provide the technology and systems at no cost to the Government.  We will consider all such projects offered, and we remain open to projects that are outside the scope of our analysis below.  
Our analysis indicates that, for Camp Pendleton, there are only two viable renewable energy schemes with the potential to meet our long term energy needs:  solar and waste to energy.
  Other schemes, such as geothermal, wind, and wave energy, are either not cost effective or interfere with the primary mission of the base as a training installation.  
We have already installed more than 2 MW of solar power systems and plan to install more solar power.  However, the size of the systems required and the lack of large and cost effective storage systems make solar energy incapable of meeting our energy needs during the night.  For these reasons, we believe waste to energy systems offer several advantages.  They will allow us to avoid costs associated with operating a landfill, meet our landfill reduction/diversion requirements, and hopefully provide us with energy in the form of electricity or syngas that is cost effective and meets our energy security needs by providing energy in all weather conditions, at night, and when power from the grid is interrupted whether from natural or manmade events.
  
The waste to energy systems we have investigated over the last few years have not been cost effective without huge tipping fees due to the low return on energy output against energy input.  Any waste to energy system must be a modular or scalar system capable of handling sludge, MSW, and bio-waste and be cost effective to operate without tipping fees, and must be provided at no cost to the government.  

We will consider all information submitted in response to this request for information.  Any future acquisition will be conducted based on the needs of the Government at the time of the acquisition and the availability of funding.  Participation in a demonstration project does not guarantee that the project will subsequently be the subject of a funded acquisition, nor does it necessarily give a vendor a more favorable position in any future procurement.
  However, since this is an area of rapidly developing technology, it is possible that a demonstration project could become a model for other installations, the Marine Corps, or the Department of Defense.

Request for Qualifications and Pricing for Bucking-Restrained Braces


A. 	GENERAL

A1.	Scope

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has retained Tina Ely Architecture/Oh Planning + Design and Degenkolb Engineers as the design architect and structural engineer (A/E), respectively, to design a new facility to house acute psychiatric functions and to prepare final bid/construction documents for the project. The intent is to design the building's seismic force-resisting system using buckling-restrained braces. 

As a supplier-designed component, there are inherent differences in the braces available in the domestic market that may have impacts on the structural performance, interior finishes, mechanical/electrical/plumbing systems, and constructability. Therefore, the VA has requested a recommendation regarding sole-sourcing the buckling-restrained braces for this project. The purpose of this RFQ is to survey the market and obtain supplier qualifications and pricing as further defined by this RFQ. 

A2.	Acquisition Method

Based on the responses to this RFQ, the Design team will make a recommendation regarding the best value for the project, as defined in this RFQ, regarding the buckling-restrained braces anticipated for use in the project. Recommendation by the design team shall not be construed to create any obligations or contractual relationship between the responding supplier/contractor and the VA or A/E.  This firm fixed price will not allow for economic price adjustment(EPA).  Price quoted will be expected to be honored for 365 days. 

The bid/construction document package will be prepared in accordance with VA acquisition regulations and procedures in anticipation of a single, fixed-price contract for construction of the seismic corrections. If approved by the VA, design and construction documents will indicate the selected supplier's system as the source for the buckling-restrained braces. While not sole-sourced, the recommended supplier's system will be used as the basis of design for the bid documents.

A4.	Project Description 

The project consists of a new one-story structural steel building with a plan area of approximately 18,000 square feet and typical roof height of 16'-0". The building's footprint comprises three wings housing various functions for the psychiatric treatment of patients. There is no basement planned and the building will be founded on spread footings and grade beams. Either HSS or wide-flange steel sections will be used for both gravity columns and at braced frame locations.

An ASCE 7-05 equivalent lateral force procedure analysis will be used to validate the seismic design. Per VA requirements, the design story drift is limited to one-half of the code limit. For this project we are anticipating to need to control inter-story drift to below 0.75%.  Braces and their connections will be designed in accordance with AISC 341-05: Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings. 


Table 1 below identifies the pertinent data for proposed bucking restrained braces.

Spectacles, Item #ANS310, and FTPE goggles, Item #ANG310, will consist of variable transmission lenses (light to dark/clear to gray) with ballistics fragmentation protection in support of Product Manager Soldier Protective Equipment (PM SPE). These products will be utilized for Army application use by the Soldier in various environments. These glasses meet the American National Standards Institute's ballistic impact safety requirements.   The items anticipated in this requirement are: 20 ea FTPE Spectacles, Item #ANS310 and 10 ea FTPE Goggles, Item #ANG310.  <br><br>Competition in this instance is inapplicable, as these particular types of glasses, FTPE, are newly developed by AlphaMicron, Inc.  The Office of Naval Research for the Naval Special Warfare has been working with AlphaMicron to develop this e-tint technology.

It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total/broad Government or specific requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>

The 5-in-1 formula penetrates to free stuck, corroded parts like nuts, bolts, valves and locks. It displaces moisture to restore wet or flooded equipment such as engines, spark plugs and power tools; while cleaning in the process. Clear and light amber liquid with a citrus odor. UOI is EA. EA = 1 can.</p>

This is not a Request for Quotes or Proposals. No contract award will be made on the basis of received in response to this notice. The purpose is to allow interested parties to assert and explain their capability to perform the work; any response must demonstrate clear and convincing evidence of capability and that competition would be advantageous to the government. Responses may be submitted until 5PM Eastern on Tuesday, May 10.

<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) currently has a contract with Eastport Analytics, Inc. of 1770 North Moore Street, Arlington, VA to develop a software application "analytical tool kit" (ATK) to better understand relationships among points of data in law enforcement databases. The government contemplates extending the period of performance of this contract and obligating additional funding in order to provide upgrades and support to the ATK, incorporating additional data sets, enhancing capability, and completing the effort. The ATK is currently in use by the Federal Air Marshal Service, and performance requires familiarity with Federal Air Marshal Service operations and its enterprise network. The contemplated sole source work will include: integrating additional law enforcement databases into the ATK; automated trends and patterns capability; ensuring operational stability; and providing an increasingly expanding level of support as the ATK is deployed.</p>
<p>The government contemplates this sole source contract period of performance extension as a "follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof..." as described in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), in which "it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>The combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a sole source Request for Proposal (RFP) under solicitation number W58RGZ-11-Q-0175.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38 effective 01 February 2010 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Document Change Notice (DCN) current to 20100305.  This procurement is being conducted pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 for other than full and open competition to TopVue Defense, Inc., 1436 Legend Hills Drive, Suite 300, Clearfield, UT 84015.  The associated North American Industrial Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this procurement is 511210 with an associated small business size standard of 500 employees.  New equipment ONLY, NO remanufactured products, and no "grey market".  Offerors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Only qualified offerors may submit quotes.  This acquisition is firm-fixed-price.<br>The Product Directorate for Aviation Networks and Mission Planning (PD ANMP) team requires an integrated and comprehensive CDRL management, CM/DM, Systems Engineering, Logistics, and Fleet Management tool for managing life cycle documentation for IDM products.  This will be procured as a lot, which will include 5 concurrent user licenses, all associated installation, implementation and training.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 entitled "Only One or a Limited Number of Responsible Source and No Other Type Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  The proposed acquisition requires the use of the authority cited based on the following:  a.) Available products have been researched, and a comparison based on required and desired capabilities has identified a COTS automation tool, TopVue, as the only viable solution to meet the integrated requirements for the team.  TopVue is ready-built with the following purchasable modules:  CDRLvue, CMvue, PMvue, Riskvue, and ILSvue (including IUID and item tracking).  The tool follows Systems Engineering guidance per IEEE 1212-2005.  Meeting IA mandatory requirements, TopVue has a Certificate of Networthiness, and has been implemented in other PEO Aviation organizations at Redstone.  b.) The TopVue system is a COTS package with an IA Certificate of Networthiness, and is currently in place for Cargo and Blackhawk on the PEO servers.  The CDRL data within ANMP-IDM on the MIS system is easily migrated to the TopVue system making it 100% compatible with the current computer system architecture in use within PEO Aviation.

NO PASSES WILL BE ISSUED AT THE GATE. Vehicle Registration hours are Monday  Friday 7:30a.m.  4:00p.m.  Significant delays may result from choosing to access the installation by obtaining a one day pass.  In which The Government will not be held responsible for any access delays.  Contractor may not at any time request consideration as a result of choosing to access the installation using the day pass process.  
Enrollment/Registration
    Companies that service Fort McCoy may enroll in the RAPIDGate Program by calling 1-877-RAPIDGate (1-877-727-4342).  The Program will confirm with the installation that the company has legitimate business on the installation. Once the company has enrolled, its employees can register at the self-service Registration Station located at the Fort McCoy Welcome Center.
    The RAPIDGate Program confirms the individuals employment status with the company, and then performs identity authentication and background screening.  Employees who qualify are issued a personalized RAPIDGate ID Badge.  The Program performs background screening on a regular basis to verify continued eligibility in the Program.

The following evaluation factors/criteria shall be evaluated by the Government: <br /><br />Volume I- Technical (non-cost) Factors- The technical factors are all of equal importance. <br /><br />Factor 1- Technical Approach <br />Factor 2- Quality Control<br /><br />Volume II- Cost or Price Factors<br />Factor - Price <br /><br /><em>FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL APPROACH </em><br />The offeror technical approach shall demonstrate an understanding of the requirements and provide the techniques and procedures that will be used to satisfy the requirements in a timely and cost effective manner. The Offeror's technical approach will be evaluated by assessing the likelihood that the proposed technical approach will meet the Government's requirements, including any associated risk of the Offeror's non-performance in the technical approach. This factor will be used to evaluate the degree to which the Offeror's proposed technical approach meets all requirements. Offerors shall demonstrate their understanding of the requirements stated in the PWS. Technical approach will be evaluated based on the extent to which the Offeror concisely and accurately discusses the nature of the services being requested as measured by the following which are considered of equal importance:<br />&bull; Understanding of the technical requirements identified in the PWS.<br />&bull; Detailed approach for providing for the technical requirements identified in the PWS.<br />&bull; A demonstration of the technical approach to be used to ensure the work is being performed on-time and properly.</p>
<p><em>FACTOR 2: QUALITY CONTROL PLAN</em>. <br />The Offeror shall provide a Quality Control Plan (QCP) which clearly states the proposed methods and techniques that will be used to maintain effectiveness of the Offeror's quality control system through the use of their quality policies, quality objectives and analysis of data, corrective action plans, preventative actions, and management review. The plan shall, at a minimum, discuss the Offeror's overall approach and procedures for evaluating each of the tasks identified in the PWS, communicating with the Government, resolving deficiencies, and identifying potential improvements. The Government will evaluate the extent to which the offeror clearly states the proposed methods and techniques that will be used to maintain effectiveness of the Offeror's quality control system through the use of their quality policies, quality objectives and analysis of data, corrective action plans, preventative actions, and management review. <br /><br /><em>FACTOR: PRICE<br /></em>Offeror shall provide fixed unit prices for each CLIN for the basic requirement and option periods identified in Attachment B, Price/Cost Schedule. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for the options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options does not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. The Government will evaluate the price proposal to determine reasonableness of price offered. Wage Determination Number 2005-2231 Revision No. 11 dated 07/27/2010 for East Baton Rouge Parish shall be applicable to the resulting contract/purchase order.

<DESC>NOAA's Office of Coast Survey (OCS) requires an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) capable of collecting swath bathymetric data in conformance with NOAA standards for nautical charting data. <br />
<p>The Coast Survey AUV project has successfully demonstrated the use of an AUV equipped with side scan sonar to conduct operational surveys to detect submerged obstructions and hazards to navigation. Coast Survey now requires a Bathymetric Mapping AUV to evaluate the operational effectiveness and data quality to determine if depth soundings collected by an AUV can meet nautical charting standards and NOAA survey requirements.</p>
<p>The Bathymetric Mapping AUV will be initially operated as a test and evaluation system aboard NOAA survey vessels, and, once standard operating procedures are established and the data validated to conform to standards it will be used aboard NOAA vessels for operational bathymetric mapping surveys in support of nautical charting. In both cases the AUV will be used in a similar fashion to the manned shipboard launches, which are deployed from the survey ship for 8-10 hours per day to perform bathymetric surveys within a short transit of the ship. The survey launches are then recovered nightly and the acquired data is transferred to shipboard computers for processing.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE<br />The objective of this contract is to provide the necessary veterinary anesthesiology in accordance with the Statement of Work and terms and conditions contained herein. The National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML) of the Alaska Fishery Science Center (AFSC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) requires wildlife anesthesia services in Alaska during 2011 to support studies of Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) population biology.</p>
<p>To study mechanisms underlying the decline of Steller sea lion populations in Alaska the NMML permanently marks Steller sea lion pups at some rookeries to determine survival and fecundity rates, and to assess health and condition. Sea lion pups must be anesthetized during the marking procedure. A purpose of this procurement is to provide anesthesia services and assistance with pup branding operations being conducted during 19 June - 6 July, at Ugamak and Agattu Islands in the Aleutian Islands. Research sites will be reached by travel on a research vessel departing from Adak and returning to Dutch Harbor, Alaska. Anesthesia procedures will be performed on three days at three different locations.</p>
<p>NMML requires two wildlife veterinary anesthesiologists familiar with Steller sea lion gas-inhalation anesthesiology to collaborate and assist with captures, administer anesthesia and monitor animal responses during anesthesia and recovery. Up to two contracts will be awarded to obtain the services of veterinarians that meet those requirements.</p>

In the event of anesthesia difficulties or pup mortalities occurring during procedures, contractors will contribute written statements describing the circumstances to a report of the events. Government will provide anesthesia equipment and drugs, all sea lion handling equipment and personal flotation and foul-weather gear, and lodging and meals while onboard the research vessel.</p>
<p>Anesthesia equipment will be provided by the Government. However, the anesthesiologists may modify, supplement, or improve Government equipment as needed to achieve the objectives of this contract. Such modifications, supplementation or additions of Government equipment must be approved by the Government prior to initiation, and costs will be paid by the Government. Anesthetists may be asked to acquire sedatives, anesthetics, reversal and revival agents, or other drugs on Governmental approval at cost to the Government.</p>

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM  STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 

(1)   The offerors past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.
  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System  Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  

(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).

(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a suppliers past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).
  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the suppliers overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:

	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*
	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*

* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.

(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on time deliveries.
  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.

(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.

(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the information in FAR Subpart 12.6, using simplified acquisition procedures under the test program for commercial items found at FAR 13.5, as supplemented with the additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued. PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE. This combined synopsis/solicitation shall be posted on both FEDBIZOPPS and NECO (http://www.neco.navy.mil/). The RFQ number is N00244-11-R-0005. This solicitation documents and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-51 and DFARS Change Notice 20110419.
 It is the contractors responsibility to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions. The clauses may be accessed in full text at these addresses: www.acqnet.gov/far and http://www.acqnet.gov/far  and http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dfars/index.htm .  The NAICS code is 334220 and the Small Business Standard is 750 employees.  

The proposed contract action is for commercial supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.
 However, all bids, proposals, or quotations received by the closing response date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

The acquisition is for the following commercial items from Western Video Inc., Fort Lauderdale, FL.   The proposed contract is to acquire High Performance, Broadcast Quality, Integrated Environmental Long Range Camera Assemblies as an integrated system in support of the Big Boy Target Area Safety and Surveillance System (TASSS) project at the MCAS Cherry Point.
  As a result of prior acquisitions and installations there is now a significant integration of common equipment that allows the previous Big Boy TASSS systems to work seamlessly with the previously installed MCAS Cherry Point purchased systems.    Substitution of alternate equipment would require extensive testing and evaluation to determine if the required parts would meet the form, fit, and function compatibility requirements of the current deployed system.    Western Videos system is the only camera system that meets the current requirements and capabilities to expand the existing Big Boy TASSS system without significant redesign and delays.  (See Attached Justification and Authorization.)

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>2010-11020A Nigeria: Children's Hospital</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to perform technical assistance ("TA") on the proposed Children's Hospital project ("Project") in Nigeria ("Host Country"). The TA will provide CAMC with recommendations regarding equipment, methods, and procedures consistent with industry best practices as CAMC strives to become Nigeria's first internationally accredited pediatric specialist facility.</p>
<p>CAMC was established in Nigeria in 2007 by founder and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Ikwunga Wonodi, a Nigerian-American doctor currently practicing psychiatry in the U.S. CAMC's board of directors is comprised of Sir Patrick Sule Ugboma, Director of a Nigerian insurance company, who serves as Chairman of the Board, Dr. Adora Okogbule-Wonodi, a practicing pediatrician who serves as the Chief Medical Director, and Mr. Chukwuemeka Ndu, Managing Director of a Nigerian leasing company, who serves as Chief Financial Director.</p>
<p>The Children's Hospital is envisioned as an 80 bed hospital which would feature a neonatal intensive care unit, biomedical research laboratory, teaching facilities, and a children's health outreach program. In addition to recommending equipment, practices and procedures, the USTDA-funded TA grant will assist CAMC in reaching out to prospective private-sector sponsors in the Lagos area who may be willing to fund the cost of treatment for patients who might not otherwise be able to afford medical care.</p>
<p>The objective of the USTDA-funded TA is to assist CAMC in planning the hospital's clinical services, facilities and support infrastructure, personnel needs, medical equipment, information technology systems, and telemedicine equipment for remote diagnosis services. Following these consultations, the Contractor will also deliver a series of workshops in Lagos targeting U.S. companies in the health sector, financing entities, Nigerian Federal and Lagos State health officials, prospective donors and sponsors, owners of local private hospitals, and consumer groups. The workshops will serve to bring the project's stakeholders together to supplement the consultations and highlight opportunities for the further involvement of the Contractor, and other U.S. health sector companies in the Nigerian health sector. The Contractor's recommendations shall be consistent with the standards set forth by the Joint Commission for International Accreditation.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $289,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit an electronic copy of their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5:00pm Local (Lagos) Time, on June 1, 2011 at the above e-mail address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis /solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is HSCEMD-11-Q-00002 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) under FAR 13.5. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-49. This procurement is a Total SBA certified-HUBZone Small-Business set-aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541690. The size standard is _7 million.</p>
<p>The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has a requirement for watch officer support for the Joint Intelligence Operations Center (JIOC) in Washington DC in accordance with the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS). The current estimated period of performance is for a 12 month base year and a 12 month option year period. The government intends to transition these positions to federal employees through insourcing and will notify contractor in writing prior to occurrence.</p>
<p>Provisions<br />The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors in descending order of importance shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) Technical Capability<br />(2) Past Performance;<br />(3) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capability and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Instructions<br />The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition with the following ADDENDUM:</p>
<p>All responses shall include two separate volumes:<br />Volume 1 - Technical Quotation<br />Volume 2 - Price Quotation</p>
<p>Volume 1 Page Limitation:<br />Excluding cover pages, the key personnel resume, any certificates and quality recognitions/awards; the technical quote is limited to __30__ one-sided pages with a maximum of three pages of tables included. A front and back side of a page will count as two pages. Quotation contents that exceed the stated page limitation will be removed from the quote by the Contracting Officer prior to turning the quote over to the Government evaluation team and will not be considered in the evaluation. Volume 2 does not have a page limitation.</p>
<p>Volume 1<br />Technical Capability<br />Offerors are required to describe their approach or plan to accomplish the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The plan should describe existing capability to meet the PWS task requirements and describe how the offeror will manage and implement effectively the tasks required to accomplish the PWS. Include an overview of the corporate organizational structure in the description and describe roles/responsibilities if any team members or subcontractors are included. Describe the corporate quality control plan and performance measurement approach to cover how performance standards will be monitored, evaluated, and reported. A draft QASP is provided with the solicitation recognizing that the successful Offeror's quality control plan may impact the Government's QASP. The QASP will be finalized within 30 days after award.</p>
<p>Provide a staffing plan describing how the staffing required under the PWS will be filled. The staffing plan should include the timeline from receipt of order to the fill of all positions. The contractor shall describe the education and experience qualifications on the proposed personnel in relation to the personnel requirements in the PWS. Include a resume for the On-site Contract Project Manager (CPM), which is considered a key personnel position. The resume should reflect the ability to perform the complexity of the work required in the PWS. The personnel will be evaluated according to the relevant work experience and qualifications to accomplish the PWS.</p>
<p>The offered capability must present sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the work requirements and a detailed plan for achieving the PWS with minimal risk to the Government. Lack of specificity or a general offer to perform the PWS may result in a quote being considered unacceptable and eliminated from further consideration for award. Offers are evaluated on the feasibility and completeness of the technical capability to integrate tasking and achieve the PWS with minimal risk to the Government.</p>
<p>Past Performance<br />Offeror's quote shall provide a summary of at least three current or past contracts for the same or similar services, within the last three years. This information should demonstrate how the Offeror has successfully performed work similar to what is described in the PWS. This summary shall also contain sufficient information for the Government to verify contractor past performance and customer satisfaction as follows. <br /><br />1. project title and contract number <br />2. start and end dates <br />3. contract value <br />4. any awards or quality demonstrators of performance achieved<br />5. respective primary Point of Contact for the customer (name, agency or firm affiliation, city and state, phone number and e-mail)</p>
<p>Successful completion of work activities similar in terms of size, complexity, type of work, as well as receipt of awards/recognition and lack of adverse contractual actions, will result in a higher rating than more narrow experience. If an Offeror has no record of relevant past performance or information on performance is not available, the Offeror will receive a "Neutral" rating, which is neither favorable nor unfavorable.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has past performance that will enhance its technical capability to perform and whether the offeror consistently delivers quality services in a timely manner. In evaluating past performance, the Government may supplement the information Offerors provide with performance information it may obtain from any source including its own experience with the Offeror and government agency databases.<br /><br />The contractor shall, as part of its proposal, present a high-level transition plan (no more than two pages long) including major milestones for adding resources and transitioning support responsibilities.</p>
<p>Volume 2<br />Price<br />Offerors shall quote a Time and Materials (T&amp;M) or labor hour type of pricing structure. Travel will be funded as a NTE CLIN (currently est. @ $25,000). The Government will add the est. $25,000 per year to each proposal for total price evaluation purposes. Travel requirements must be preapproved prior to being taken. The offer must submit proposed price by year and include a summary for the base period and the option period. For evaluation purposes, the following anticipated distribution of labor hours by labor categories shall be used by offerors in preparing their price quote. <br /><br /><br />BASE YEAR (12 Months)</p>

CONTRACT INFORMATION:  These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  See Numbered Note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.  The services will consist of core drilling and geotechnical subsurface sampling via continuous and/or standard SPT techniques, large diameter coring within rock units, sonic drilling, vibracoring, field and in situ testing, geophysical site investigations, field and laboratory testing of materials (including construction Q/A testing), chemical analytical laboratory testing, site preparation, and establishing coordinate locations for projects located within the Florida boundaries of the Jacksonville District, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Caribbean area.  The primary purpose of these proposed contracts are to provide services for projects located within the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  Secondarily, these contracts may be used to provide services within the geographic boundaries of the other U.S. Army Corps of Engineers districts within the South Atlantic Division.  The contractor will have the right to refuse orders for services to be performed outside the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts.  It is the intent of the Government to initially award two (2) contracts, one (1) contract from the 8(a) set aside and one (1) Small Business set aside.  However, if there are no highly qualified 8(a) small businesses, the award will be made from the highly qualified small business firms.  No one firm will receive more than one award as a result of this solicitation.  Only firms considered highly qualified will be awarded a contract.  Indefinite delivery contracts will be negotiated and awarded from this solicitation with subsequent work issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders.  This announcement will result in up to two (2) awards.  Criteria used in allocating task orders among contracts include performance and quality of deliverables under current task orders, current capacity to accomplish the order in the required time, specialized experience, equitable distribution of the work among the contractors, and other relevant factors.  The contracts will be for a period of one year from date of award, with options to extend for four additional years; not to exceed a total of five years.  While the estimated dollar amount per year is $1,000,000.00, the actual obligation per year may be greater than or less than the $1,000,000.00.  Maximum order limit is $5,000,000 for the life of the contract, including options.  The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense.  The rule authorizes contracting officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered.  For more information, visit the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov.

<p>(2) Electronic form means any automated system that transmits information electronically from the initiating system to all affected systems.

<p>(3) Payment request means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the Contractor under this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF, in one of the following electronic formats that WAWF accepts: Electronic Data Interchange, Secure File Transfer Protocol, or World Wide Web input. Information regarding WAWF is available on the Internet at https://wawf.eb.mil/.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor may submit a payment request and receiving report using other than WAWF only when--</p>
<p>(1) The Contracting Officer authorizes use of another electronic form. With such an authorization, the Contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree to a plan, which shall include a timeline, specifying when the Contractor will transfer to WAWF;</p>
<p>(2) DoD is unable to receive a payment request or provide acceptance in electronic form;</p>
<p>(3) The Contracting Officer administering the contract for payment has determined, in writing, that electronic submission would be unduly burdensome to the Contractor.

<p>(e) In addition to the requirements of this clause, the Contractor shall meet the requirements of the appropriate payment clauses in this contract when submitting payments requests.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />SHIPPING AND RECEIVING INSTRUCTIONS (JUN 2009)</p>
<p>MARKING: Contractors shall ensure that the contract number is clearly marked on the exterior of all shipping cartons/containers. This will assist in timely receipt of and payment for the supplies accepted.</p>
<p>The purchase/delivery order number can be located in blocks 1 and 2 of the DD Form 1155 and block 2 of the SF 1449. It also appears at the top of each subsequent page .</p>
<p>If drop shipping procedures are used, please ensure that your shipper complies with these instructions. Cartons without identification may be returned "freight collect".</p>
<p>SHIPPING: The purchase/delivery order provides the only approved ship to/delivery address(es). Do not redirect shipments to locations other than those specified in the order. To do so may delay acceptance of and payment for the items shipped.</p>
<p>Additional costs for shipment to addresses other than those specified on the order will not be paid unless the ship to/delivery address has been changed by a modification to the order signed by a contracting officer.</p>
<p>INVOICING PROCEDURES:</p>
<p>ELECTRONIC INVOICING: Except as provided in paragraph (c) of DFARS Clause 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (Mar 2007), the Contractor shall submit payment requests through Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) utilizing the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) method. The COMBO method is designed to generate a notification to the receiver that an invoice has been submitted and requires a receiving report. Utilization of this feature is expected to minimize delays in the payment process.</p>
<p>Contractors shall register to use WAWF and ensure an electronic business point of contact (POC) is designated in the Central Contractor Registration site at http://www.ccr.gov within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract/order.</p>

<DESC>Type of Notification:   Request for Proposal (RFP) for Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) TRANSPORTATION SERVICES
NOTE - THIS IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  DOE will only accept proposals from small businesses that do not exceed the small business size standard of $25.5M in average annual receipts under NAICS code 484230 "Specialized Freight (except used goods) Trucking, Long-Distance."
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is procuring the continuation of carrier services for the award of a contract or contracts for the transport of contact-handled (CH) and remote-handled (RH) transuranic (TRU) wastes and mixed hazardous constituents, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and asbestos between various DOE sites across the country and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, New Mexico.   
The transport of TRU waste is accomplished by contract carriers that transport the waste via public highways on custom designed trailers in Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approved packages.  The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract using firm-fixed- price delivery task orders over a five-year contract period, consisting of a one year base ordering period and four additional one-year option ordering periods.  
This procurement will replace two existing carrier contracts that will expire March 2012 and September 2012, respectively.  Two contracts are anticipated to be awarded by March 2012. The carriers are responsible for transitioning the work from the current carrier contractors without interruption, and maintaining the WIPP disposal schedule.
Contractor proposals are requested by May 17, 2011.  THE RFP CAN BE FOUND AT: www.emcbc.doe.gov/WIPP/index.php
Interested parties are encouraged to view the website at www.emcbc.doe.gov/WIPP/index.php regularly for information about this procurement as it will be the primary conduit with which to provide such information.

<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>

<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
