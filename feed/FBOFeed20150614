<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration, Office of Acquisition and Grant Services, intends to award a sole source contract to Pragmatic Data LLC for annual software maintenance.
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under FAR authority FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>The FDA has procured from Pragmatic Data software licenses for Pragmatic Data Integrator and the PRPLLR module. This software is currently used to automatically process files containing drug establishment and drug product information including product labeling. If the FDA didn't have the software, it would be unable to process, review and distribute this information in a timely and cost effective fashion.  The  FDA also procured an additional module (Review and Edit Module) to process ingredient and product information generated by FDA. This software allows FDA to integrate internal data with data obtained from companies to allow more efficient processing, review and distribution of information.  Annual maintenance for these licenses is required to continue regulatory operations. Annual maintenance includes product updates, patches, and professional services to support software operations and use of the information processed.  Pragmatic Data operations and maintenance services and software coding are currently sold exclusively by Pragmatic Data and there are no resellers.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is currently available.  However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or a quotation within fifteen (15) days after publication of this notice, which shall be considered by the agency.  All such responses shall be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration, via email, to the point of contact below.</p>

<DESC>On behalf of the U.S. AbilityOne Commission, the independent federal agency that administers the AbilityOne Program, National Industries for the Blind (NIB), a designated central nonprofit agency, is pursuing potential partnerships with U.S. commercial manufacturers of general purpose, non-solvent, water dilutable cleaning compounds for aircraft, for the purpose of providing employment for people who are blind or severely disabled by furnishing such products to the federal government under the AbilityOne Program.  If successful, the result will be a co-brand agreement between the manufacturer and the AbilityOne Program, and its registered brands.  The ultimate expectation is that the co-branded product will be placed on the AbilityOne Procurement List (PL).
<p>To be considered for the partner opportunity, the following criteria at a minimum must be met by the commercial manufacturer:</p>
<p>1.	Possession of a nationally-known brand name that can be demonstrated to have significant appeal through evidence of substantial sales and market share.  <br />2.	Item must qualify to MIL-PRF-85570.<br />3.	Can replace several traditional solvents including mineral spirits and methyl ethyl ketone. <br />4.	Contains a mild pH and low VOC content to reduce hazards to workers and the environment. <br />5.	Provides a broad range of non-solvent cleaning and corrosion inhibition. <br />6.	For painted and unpainted aircraft alloys.<br />7.	Manufacturer's response must include the general product information.<br />8.
