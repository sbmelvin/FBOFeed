<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) is developing a spacecraft known as the Common Bus.This spacecraft uses a modular approach for subsystems such that it can be reconfiguredto work in a wide range of flight applications. The first mission for the Common Busspacecraft is the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Experiment (LADEE). LADEE willlaunch in 2012, and will collect science data regarding the lunar residual atmosphere byflying in an elliptical lunar orbit for approximately 100 days. ARC has existing Broad Reach Software Development Units (SDUs); these need to be enhancedto have interfaces compatible with each of the LADEE Payloads. In order to reduce riskwith the mission and assure proper operations of the LADEE Payloads, interface testingneeds to be performed between Spacecraft Flight-like interfaces and each of the PayloadInterfaces.  All components are expected to function  similar to flight-like components.NASA/ARC intends to purchase the service and components to enhance the SDUs from BroadReach Engineering (BRE). The SDUs need to be modified and validated by BRE in order toensure proper operation. BRE is the only source which can provide an upgrade to theexisting SDUs. Use of other avionics hardware would be incompatible with existingcomponents, and thus would require additional engineering effort, leading to unacceptablelead times.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12, using theauthority of FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 5:00 p.m. PST on 04August 2009.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purposeof determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Adetermination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.Information about major upcoming ARC procurement actions is available athttp://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eis/admin/admin.cgi?center=ARC	An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Health Effects Laboratory Division, Engineering and Control Technology Branch, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to The Pennsylvania State University for the development of a 3D Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) hardware based on interface with markerless motion capture and Prototype 3D Portable Biomechanics Assessment Suite (PBAS).</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>1. Enhance the prototype PBAS (based upon 2D IMUs) to obtain body kinematics with positional accuracies of three millimeters (3 mm) for translations, and two degrees (2 deg) for rotations. <br />a. Translational kinematics should be sufficient to determine the position of joint centers (i.e., segment endpoints). <br />b. Rotational kinematics should be sufficient to determine flexion-extension and abduction-adduction for all joints (i.e., for locally defined reference frames); they should also be sufficient to determine internal-external rotation for the head-thorax and for the pelvis (i.e., for a globally defined reference frame).<br />c. Technologies should include:<br />i. Primary: markerless motion capture (in collaboration with NIOSH/HELD/ECTB and a separate contractor)<br />ii. Secondary: 3D IMUs (accelerometers, rate gyroscopes, magnetometers)<br />2. Combine these body kinematics and force algorithms into a prototype 3D PBAS.<br />a. Kinematic and kinetic output from the prototype may be in a format convenient for the contactor, but should also include the C3D file format for direct input to Visual3D biomechanical analysis software.<br />b. Sensors should be as small and as light as possible to avoid interference with body motions. However, quantifying interference with body motions is beyond the scope of this prototype development.<br />c. Data storage capabilities should include battery powered on-board storage for a work shift (from the start of work, to the first break period), and should be achieved with a sampling rate of no less than 50 Hz.</p>
<p>3. Use the 3D PBAS prototype to obtain body kinematics and kinetics, simultaneous with laboratory-based measures, and assess accuracy. These tests are to involve multiple human subjects, and involve loads of various weight and dimensions (e.g, small, medium, and large). They may be conducted at NIOSH/HELD/ECTB Morgantown, in collaboration with biomechanics staff.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:&nbsp; 12 months.</p>
<p><br />Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Rebecca Mullenax, Purchasing Agent, Reference 000HCCCE-2009-72695, Centers for Disease Control, NIOSH, ATTN: Rebecca Mullenax, MS: GD, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Respiratory Hazards Control Branch, Pittsburgh, PA, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Anatech USA for a Plasma Vacuum System.
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The Respiratory Hazards Control Branch of PRL has a research program involving the measurement of crystalline silica (quartz) dust. Quartz dust is known to cause or contribute to respiratory illness of exposed workers, including those in the mining industry. Airborne mine dust is collected onto filters and analysis by a specific protocol occurs afterward. The accurate and convenient (quick) analysis of quartz collected on a new type of filter is a goal of our research. This new type of filter comes from a recently developed real-time dust measurement instrument, currently being adopted across the U.S. The instrument's filters have much greater mass than previously used filters.</p>
<p>To achieve a careful reproduction of the MSHA ashing method, the same asher manufacturer must be utilized. Through the overall design of the asher and also it's electronically programmable operation, the same ashing conditions can be accomplished. By selection of an asher model that allows high radiofrequency (RF) energy for the smallest available sample chamber volume, more intense ashing is possible, while still having compatibility with less aggressive operation. Method harmonization and flexibility are simultaneously and optimally achieved by selection of an Anatech USA plasma asher, with high RF output and small sample chamber volume. Further, prospects for success are improved because of established on-site interagency expertise with Anatech instruments.</p>
<p>The Anatech USA model SCE-104 RF is a specialized instrument that addresses our specific requirements. Its features and operation highly reflect those of ashers used by MSHA, so that MSHA ashing methods can be closely reproduced. Also as required, it has a minimum size sample chamber and enhanced RF energy output, needed to accomplish more aggressive ashing of high-mass samples. Because the cited instrument is uniquely suited for the requirements of our research, it is considered solely for acquisition, the expedient and best fulfillment of our instrumentation needs.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.

<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement.

<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the FAA's intent to contract with a selected firm using single source procedures.
The FAA has a requirement to purchase four (4) Custom Glare Shield Displays with Touch overlay. The wide Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) is designed to fit in a standard aircraft glare shield.  The LCD display is being installed in an A-320 cockpit where all displays and controls are rendered in graphics so as to be completely reconfigurable.  The size constraints of the Glare section are highly demanding and require a display 29" wide by 4" high.  To provide pilot input controls, a custom touch overlay is also required. A.D.T.C Systems of Aptos, CA was selected for this procurement because they are the only company that has the technical knowledge and experience to resize LCD panels of the size required by the FAA, and they are the only company that has the software, protected by commercial license, that can drive the displays. 
A competitive solicitation will not be available for this procurement.  Any/all questions or concerns should be directed to William Zeiger, via email at william.zeiger@faa.gov by no later than 10:00 AM EST, 7/29/2009.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT:
The Department of Energy (DOE) is pursuing a sole source contract with INFORUM for consulting services under FAR 6.302-1, One Responsible Source. The purchase order?s proposed period of performance is 12 months from date of award.
The work areas that the contractor are responsible to perform include consulting services for the INFORUM input-output model of the US and Chinese Economies.  The value of this effort is estimated to be $37,540.00.

<DESC>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Kennedy Space Center (KSC) hasa requirement for 21, 30-gallon drums of Dibrom 14 to control mosquitoes in outlyingareas of KSC, where the use of aerial equipment is necessary to apply chemicals to areasimpossible to spray without an aircraft. Dibrom 14 is supplied annually by KSC to theBrevard County Mosquito Control District (BCMCD) in accordance with the Mosquito ControlAgreement between KSC, Air Force Eastern Test Range, US Fish and Wildlife Service(USFWS), and Brevard County. AMVAC Chemical Corporation, the manufacturer of Dibrom 14,has verified that Adapco, Incorporated of Sanford, Florida is the sole distributor ofthis product for the state of Florida. Other authorized distributors are prohibited fromdistributing the product beyond their state or assigned territory. KSC intends to purchase the 21, 30-gallon drums of Dibrom 14 from Adapco, Incorporated ofSanford, Florida. Dibrom 14 is an adulticide used to control mosquitoes. There areseveral areas at the Launch Pads and Launch Complex 39, where normal chemicals used atKSC cannot be sprayed due to chemical corrosiveness and flight hardware. Moreover, theseareas are also very large and impossible to spray without an aircraft, which KSC does notpossess. The Mosquito Control Agreement provides the equipment (aircraft) to spray largeareas of water in the KSC area to control mosquitoes without having to spray directlyaround the pads. KSC procures and supplies the Dibrom 14 to BCMCD for spraying. Dibrom 14is the only chemical that can be used, because it is the only chemical BCMCD is licensedto spray in the KSC and impound areas. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interestedorganizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort inwriting to Donny Wood at donald.wood@nasa.gov, not later than 12:00 PM EST on Tuesday,July 28, 2009.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Canberra Industries, Inc. in Meriden, CT for the purchase of an three (3) Sirus 4B hand and foot monitors and two (2) copies of the monitoring software CRemote. 

The Environmental Health and Safety Division currently has a network of Canberra monitors to include four Argos 4Bs, five C7/PCs, one PMW2, one APM3e, and one GEM5, located in various buildings throughout the campus.

There are no other manufacturers in the industry that can network with our existing Canberra units.

The monitors will be networked together to provide data that is required for monitoring and regulatory compliance.  The network will use CRemote software for LAN control which has been developed specifically for the Canberra line of monitors. If a different manufacturers equipment were to be introduced to the existing network of personal contamination monitors, the instruments will not communicate effectively.  The inability to communicate effectively will compromise the safety of NIST personnel and all other individuals that they come into contact with as false readings could be produced and the personnel could be carrying radioactive contamination from inaccurate results obtained from another type of monitor other than Canberra.  

The detectors within the units are required by regulation to be checked periodically to make sure they are working properly. NIST uses a calibration source that is made with Tc-99 radioactive material that has already been developed for testing the Canberra detectors.  

NIST also has a stock of replacement parts that includes detectors and pre-amps that are direct replacements for the Canberra equipment and can be interchanged with the existing equipment for immediate replacement should the part become defective to minimize necessary repairs to the existing fleet of personal contamination monitors.

The introduction of any other manufacturer other than Canberra, would result in inaccurate readings between the monitors in the network, would require an additional expense to the Government to purchase replacement parts that are compatible to that specific manufacturers monitor, and would require the purchase and development of a new calibration source.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 90 days after receipt of order.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333314, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by August 4, 2009.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The cited authority is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The incumbent contractors have been involved in the recruitment, treatment strategies, follow-up, collection and analysis of data, and reporting of results on 161,808 participants from 40 clinical centers across the United States. These contractors have the unique capability to provide these required services to NHLBI for the follow-up of the study. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make open competition unfeasible for this study. The objectives of the study are detailed below.

Background and Purpose of the WHI:  

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) was established to elucidate the etiology and prevention of major causes of disability and death in older women (age range 50-79), namely cardiovascular disease, cancers of the breast, colon and rectum, and hip fractures. The program included three clinical trials in a partial factorial design (N=68,132) and a large observational study (N=93,677) for a total of 161,808 participants enrolled (17% minority). The program collected data on outcomes and exposures that span across most disease domains. During the first phase of the program (1993-2005) the three clinical trials and the concurrent observational study were completed. The trials of hormone therapy were stopped early, in 2002 for estrogen plus progestin because of harm for CHD, stroke, VTE and breast cancer, and in 2004 for estrogen alone because of harm for stroke and VTE and lack of benefit for CHD. In an ancillary study, women over age
65 had an increased risk of dementia in both hormone arms. The trials of low fat dietary modification and of calcium and vitamin D continued to 2005 as planned.  

The currently ongoing renewal of WHI (2005-2010) enrolled 115,405 women (77% of those eligible) at 40 field centers. The post-stopping of therapy experience of the clinical trial participants in regard to trial exposures and clinical events are being monitored. The 3-year data after stopping estrogen plus progestin have been published, and the other trials will publish post-stopping data in 2010. The additional outcomes accrued in the observational study have been used to extend the clinical trial findings and are being utilized in several ancillary and consortium studies. The WHI data and biologic resources have been made widely available to the scientific community, and in particular two rounds of Broad Agency Announcements have funded 22 investigations utilizing the biologic samples. The current annual retention rate of the cohort is 98%.

WHI 2010-2015 Extension Study Objectives: A further 5-year observational WHI follow-up study is anticipated from October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2015. During this time, all WHI participants will be invited to provide informed consent for continued follow-up of clinical outcomes, return of study questionnaires, and willingness to be approached for future ancillary studies including clinical trials. It is estimated that a total of ~100,000 women (85% of living participants, projected age range 62-95 with 35% over age 80) will enroll in the 2010-2015 extension. 

While it is well known that cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of death in American women, it is less appreciated that the vast majority of these deaths occur in older women (women over the age of 80). They account for an increasing proportion of the CVD morbidity and mortality, and suffer from a number of important phenotypes, which include diastolic heart failure, hypertension, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and atrial fibrillation. Elderly women
comprise the most rapidly growing demographic in the US population, yet only ~4,500 women over the age of 80 are currently being following in other NHLBI cohort studies. The WHI has a very large cohort of older women with a demonstrated enthusiasm for clinical research; the cohort is rich in clinical, phenotypic, and genotypic data; and it is supported by a strong research infrastructure. This follow-up takes advantage of the WHI cohort and its investigators to launch the next generation of critically important cardiovascular research projects that target older women. The renewal plans to continue support for following the cohort from 2010-2015, with several modifications to enhance its scientific value. The depth of the follow-up will be increased for two important sub-cohorts (hormone trial participants, and African American and Hispanic participants with GWAS data, N~24,000, with ~8,400 over age 80) but will be scaled back to collect self-reported data only for the remaining (~76,000) participants from the other study trials and the observational study. In addition to the continued follow-up of the hormone trial participants to evaluate long term effects of treatment, both the hormone trial and minority populations will serve as observational studies with a new focus on three CVD outcomes with substantial burden in older women (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and venous thrombo-embolism) while continuing current adjudication of CHD, stroke, cancer, and other outcomes. The combined hormone trial and minority GWAS cohorts will have substantial minority representation (~28% African American, 12% Hispanic, 58% White).  

It is anticipated that the National Institute on Aging and the National Cancer Institute will continue their associations with NHLBI during this follow-up phase.   

The Coordinating Centers expected responsibilities that will continue during the follow up phase include (but are not limited to)  data management and analysis activities including the documentation and maintenance of appropriate confidentiality and security of files for the study and sub-studies; lead the development of the protocol and manuals of procedures development; continue to support a morbidity/mortality monitoring and adjudication system; maintain quality control and monitoring of the performance status of the field centers; maintain the biological specimen laboratory; solicit and monitor laboratories; coordinate, arrange, participate in, and provide any information necessary for regular Steering Committee, Observations Study Monitoring Board, training and other necessary study meetings; and provide technical reports as required by the Government.

The restructuring of the WHI field centers into up to 5 regional field centers will include funding for coordinating regional activities including, documentation of clinical outcomes, engaging investigators inside and outside current centers to propose analyses and ancillary studies, to perform distributed data analyses, and to train new investigators. Having a limited number of regional field centers will streamline study management and will facilitate ancillary studies within the region, and across regions, compared to having 40 field centers. 

This notice of intent expires 15-days from its posting. This is not a request for proposals (RFP).  This notice does not commit the Government to awarding any contracts.  The estimated award date is October 1, 2010. All responsible sources may submit written capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform this research effort on the same study participants. Any interested parties in this or potential subcontracting opportunities may contact either Paul D. McFarlane, Contract Specialist, pm24v@nih.gov, 301-435-0345 or Peggy D.

<DESC>To support current National Park Service (NPS) and Department of the Interior (DOI) goals to reduce Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) liability at park facilities, Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs) must be conducted to determine whether or not any hazardous waste sites or contamination exists prior to land purchases and transactions.  To facilitate this process we seek assistance in conducting Phase I ESAs consistent with requirements set forth under 40 CFR 312 (the All Appropriate Inquiry (AAI) standard), or requirements in the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)1527-05.
The Phase I ESA will include an analysis of current and historical conditions with respect to potential site contaminants and for CERCLA liability. The goal of the site assessment is to identify potential liabilities under CERCLA before land transactions take place so that costs can be incorporated into land transactions and so that individual park facilities do not end up bearing the brunt of the cost of CERCLA clean-up.  Phase I ESAs must be conducted by an Environmental Professional (EP) as described under the AAI standard.
Phase I ESAs will be conducted using current requirements under the AAI standard and to identify Recognized Environmental Conditions (RECs) and historical RECs or other environmental liability associated with the subject properties proposed for acquisition, disposal, and exchange

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Belinda L. Toews 703-432-3359
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) has a requirement for a Fluid Warming System (FWS) that will complement the Health Service Support (HSS) systems with available technology that diminishes logistic complexity, takes advantage of lightweight /durable materials and supports the modern maneuver elements.  This FWS project will result in the development of a ruggedized, upright configured FWS container capable of the following:  holding 24 liters of bagged or bottled irrigation fluid; the fluid warming device shall maintain fluid temperatures from 37 to 52 degrees C (98 - 125 degrees F); unit shall maintain internal temperature of -1,+2degrees C [-1, +3degrees F] of set point; unit shall have an ambient operating temperature range of -32-52 degrees C [-25 - 125 degrees F]; maintain a testable fluid temperature at 40 degrees C [104degrees F] within -1, +2 degrees C [-1, +3 degrees F] of set point; capable of ! transport by a 463-L pallet; outer case shall be made of corrosion and dent resistant material that will allow the outer case to act as its own shipping container (FRP fiberglass reinforced composite materials or rotomolded thermoplastic; maximum displaced volume of 11 cubic feet and a maximum weight , inclusive of a 60 pound payload, (four man carry) of 266 pounds .  Currently, the USMC does not have a ruggedized fielded system capable of meeting this requirement.  This system will be instrumental in the treatment of patients during operations located in both hot and cold weather environments where our war fighters are deployed.  Studies have shown that the use of warmed irrigation fluid during surgery greatly reduces the risk of hypothermia and other complications.  The requirement will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with a base year (date of award through 12 months) and a 1 one year option.  The minimum quantity is anticipated to be five (5) and a maximum quantity of eight (8) FWS production demonstration models.  The Government may award contracts up to four (4) offerors using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures.   There is an additional requirement of 82 FWS which may be exercised under the option.  The minimum quantity is anticipated to be one (1) and a maximum quantity of 82.  This is an unrestricted procurement.  The NAICS code is 339113 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Request for Proposal (RFP) M67854-09-R-3057 will be posted on the internet at the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov, and Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at http://www.neco.navy.mil.

<p>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. It is intended as a method of informing potential contractors of the existence of a Bid Qualification Plan for Paveway II Laser Guided Bombs. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government. The United States Air Force (USAF), United States Navy (USN) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) units are seeking potential contractors to "qualify to bid" as a source supplier for Paveway II Laser Guided Bombs for an anticipated GBU-16, GBU-12 and GBU-10 procurement. The Bid Qualification Plan outlines those efforts necessary to "qualify potential producers to bid" as a source supplier of GBU-16, GBU-12 and GBU-10 Laser Guided Bombs. Upon contract award, the selected best value contractor shall be required to complete additional significant efforts to demonstrate complete interchangeability and interoperability with existing U.S. Government inventories not limited to: demonstration, analysis, environmental testing and additional drop testing.

REFERENCE NUMBER: 09-37<br />10. SBO REFERENCE NUMBER: 09-48<br />11. SOLICITATION NUMBER: FA8814-09-R-0002<br />12. DESCRIPTION:<br />a) The Space and Missile Systems Center, Development Planning Directorate (SMC/XR) plans to award a sole source contract to the Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL), a non-profit University Affiliated Research Center (UARC). Pursuant to FAR 6.302-3(a) (2) (aka the "UARC exception"), this contract is necessary to maintain essential engineering, research, or development capabilities provided by JHU/APL. The period of performance of the contract is expected to run from 31 October 2009 to 31 October 2014 (five years). The estimated approximate value is $29 million.
<p>b) JHU/APL's core engineering, research, and development competencies include: strategic systems test and evaluation (including Modeling and Simulation [M&amp;S], range support testing, development of specialized GPS instrumentation, and strategic missile systems engineering and analysis); space science and engineering (including sensor development and prototyping); and combat system and guided missile R&amp;D.</p>
<p>c) Under this contract, JHU/APL shall provide specialized Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) and range support to the Conventional Strike Missile (CSM) project. Specifically, JHU/APL shall assist in evaluating and developing new technologies, capabilities and systems; performing risk reduction efforts; and designing, engineering, building, and fielding capability demonstrations. It is also contemplated that JHU/APL could provide its expertise in sensor technology and rapid prototyping to support new sensor development.</p>
<p>d) This contract is necessary to meet the following requirements: <br />&bull; Continue M&amp;S and Design Evaluation work for the CSM project on the Payload Deployment Vehicle (PDV) hypersonic glide vehicle and the down-range aspects of flight test support;<br />&bull; Obtain for the CSM project the necessary domain knowledge and M&amp;S support in the following areas: GNC/accuracy, system accuracy performance evaluation, system performance assessment, GPS systems, hypersonic aerodynamics, structures and thermodynamics, and trajectory;<br />&bull; Obtain mid and down range support, as well as mission planning activities for the CSM demonstration flight;<br />&bull; Obtain support for early integration activities associated with the GPS systems instrumentation;<br />&bull; Enable transfer of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Falcon program lessons learned and applicable risk mitigation strategies to the CSM program<br />&bull; Allow XRF to rapidly develop material solution prototypes in order to assess the viability of new missile and space system concepts for utility, as well as of new sensor technology</p>
<p>e) Functions to be performed by JHU/APL include: <br />&bull; Establishing models and simulations to develop and evaluate test objectives, system evaluation objectives; to evaluate design and test options; and to support program risk reduction activities;<br />&bull; Providing technical support at all the early design reviews such as PDR and CDR;<br />&bull; Providing general modeling and simulation support as part of the CSM systems engineering team for on-going CSM trade studies methods;<br />&bull; Evaluating, coordinating, and recommending mid-course and impact range instrumentation assets, as well as providing support for target deployment and instrumentation;<br />&bull; Planning for the future transfer of the third GPS Full Spectrum Translator (FST) from the Falcon program, updating the models associated with the GPS translator for the CSM program, and developing the GPS translator to PDV Interface Coordination Document;<br />&bull; Exploring and recommending GPS instrumentation alternatives in response to constraints on weight, space, power or other coordinated interfaces;<br />&bull; Performing RF link margin analysis and GPS signal acquisition studies in support of risk reduction and planning for future test flights;<br />&bull; Using applicable portions of the flight test evaluation plan developed for the Falcon program on the CSM program;<br />&bull; Leveraging the experience gained from the Conventional Prompt Global Strike mission planning and analysis activities provided to OSD AT&amp;L in support of the CSM program;<br />&bull; Developing an all-source Best Estimate Trajectory (BET) from the Inertial Measurement Unit and GPS data sources;<br />&bull; Evaluating the accuracy performance of the navigation, guidance and control of the PDV as part of risk mitigation activities for CSM; and</p>
<p>f) Potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) are mitigated in the following manner: <br />(1) Preventing unfair competitive advantage - To prevent JHU/APL from gaining an unfair competitive advantage, XRF will include in the OCI clause a provision that JHU/APL may not compete at either the prime or the subcontractor level against industry in response to competitive RFPs for development and production involving engineering expertise specifically developed or maintained through this sole source UARC contract (issued under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3)(B)). This makes JHU/APL a neutral member of the government team and thereby eliminates this OCI issue. <br />(2) Preventing the existence of conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment - Because the knowledge JHU/APL will gain from testing and evaluating sensors from various contractors shall not be used by JHU/APL to develop and build competitive options for an objective system, any bias or perception of bias in JHU/APL's test and evaluation of the various sensors will be minimal to nonexistent.</p>
<p>Responses from small and small, disadvantaged businesses are encouraged.</p>

<DESC>In 2009, Pantex completed construction of remedial actions under the Environmental Restoration Program. This included the construction of the final remedial actions and groundwater monitoring network. The remaining environmental cleanup work to be performed at the site includes long term stewardship operations and maintenance of engineered controls at the site. Two of those engineered controls are in situ bioremediation (ISB) systems that were constructed to treat contaminated groundwater. ISB was identified in the Corrective Measures Study/Feasibility Study in September of 2007 as one corrective measures alternative for the perched groundwater to prevent migration of constituents of concern (COCs). One system is on the southeast edge of the perched groundwater; the other is south of Zone 11.

The Southeast ISB consists of 42 injection wells; four amendment distribution vaults; an equipment pad with electrical, water, and amendment conveyance connections and an area for staging the injection trailer and water supply tanks (commonly called Afrac tanks) and amendment tanks; and an injection control system in a portable trailer. This area has high explosives and metals contamination, but is not amenable to extraction due to the limited saturation. The primary perched groundwater COCs in the ISB Barrier area includes Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) and total and hexavalent chromium.  ISB was selected for this area to treat the contamination and prevent further migration of contaminants.  

The Zone 11 ISB consists of 32 injection wells and an equipment pad with electrical and water connections and an area for staging the injection trailer and water supply and amendment tanks. The injection control trailer from the Southeast ISB system is used at the Zone 11 system as well. The Zone 11 ISB system design addresses contaminated groundwater south of Zone 11. The primary COCs (risk drivers) in the area of the perched groundwater south of Zone 11 are perchlorate and Trichloroethylene (TCE).  
	
The objectives of this Statement of Work are to:

(1)	Perform inspection and maintenance of the injection wells associated with the Southeast and Zone 11 ISB Systems to maximize the effectiveness of ISB treatment; 
(2)	Perform injection operations of amendment at the ISB systems to maintain the treatment barriers; and
(3)	Evaluate the treatment systems= performance and describe it in quarterly monitoring reports.

<DESC>Sources Sought - Parachutes and Compatible Parachute Replacement Parts to be used for Firefighting Activities
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Operations Center (NOC), is seeking sources for a requirement for parachutes and compatible replacement parts to be used for firefighting activities for the protection of public lands in Alaska.
Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and FAR ll.105, the BLM, NOC thinks this requirement is a sole source to Airborne Systems North America of NJ, Inc. located at 5800 Magnolia Ave., Pennsauken, NJ 08109-1309 (Airborne), due to specific requirements for these parachutes and compatible replacement parts.  Based on the information available at this time, it appears that Airborne has a unique product that meets all the required characteristics.
The salient characteristics for this acquisition are as follows:  1) The parachute provided shall be approved for use in the BLM smokejumper program, 2) The parachute provided shall be approved for use with the BLM smokejumper ram-air parachute system, 3) The parachute provided shall be a 270-square-foot 5-cell ram-air reserve parachute, 4) The parachute provided shall have a 375-square-foot canopy able to accommodate a payload ranging from 220 to 300 pounds, 5) The parachute shall be able to achieve descent rates from 8 feet per second in no wind conditions and shall be able to reach these rates using a static, deep brake setting, 6) The parachute provided shall include slotted stabilizers sufficient for good slow speed performance, 7) The parachute canopy shall have a minimum 20 mile per hour forward speed, 8) The parachute shall be standardized with canopies compatible with the BLM approved main parachute container, 9) The parachute shall have span-wise construction in order to allow a 375-square-foot canopy to fit the BLM inventory of deployment bags and containers, and 10) The reserve canopy for the parachute shall be sized to fit the BLM approved reserve container with a pack volume no greater than 745 cubic inches.  These characteristics are required to allow the firefighters to function safely in small meadows surrounded by large trees and in high wind areas with lightening caused fires, and to be compatible with the BLM deployment system.
The NAICS code for this acquisition is 314999 with a size standard of 500 employees.
Based on the information available at this time, and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), the Government considers the items specified as a sole source to Airborne and proposes to negotiate a firm-fixed-price contract on that basis for 100 parachutes, 50 reserve compatible canopies, 50 reserve compatible deploy systems, and 120 compatible risers.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Concerns who think they can furnish the required items or their equivalent are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures, and such other materials that correspond to the required characteristics of these parachutes and compatible replacement parts to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Upon receipt of an affirmative response, it will be evaluated technically by BLM.  No solicitation document exists; therefore, requirements for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request and will not be considered.  The notice may represent the Governments only official notice of this procurement.  Response may be made by email to Cheryl_Flanagan@blm.gov .  If response is by FAX, send it to Cheryl Flanagan, 303-236-9470.  If response is by mail or other paper delivery method, provide two copies of all literature, brochures, and other materials to Cheryl Flanagan, Contract Specialist, BLM  NOC, Building 50, P. O. Box 25040 Denver Federal Center, Denver, CO 80225.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The National Institutes of Health intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Elsevier B.V., 360 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10010-1710 for web on-line access service to Elseviers Science Direct, Scopus and EMBASE databases as well as access to online journals and books published or produced by Elsevier. This access will be made available to NIH community as well as HHS staff. No solicitation exists for this requirement. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. The product is a commercial item as defined in FAR Part 2.101. The period of performance shall be for one twelve (12) month period, with options to renew for four (4) successive twelve month periods. It is believed that Elsevier B.V. is the sole source for this requirement under the authority of U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and not other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements) because of the following: Elsevier B.V. is the sole owner of Science Direct, the only known source of the Elsevier titles on the world wide web; Elsevier developed the Science Direct on-line services and has exclusive proprietary rights to it. Consequently, to provide access to the many Elsevier titles to NIH staff from their desktop computers, the only option is Science Direct by Elsevier through the World Wide Web. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. 

Below is the Draft Statement of Work. This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capability. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the Government to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements of the Statement of Work. Capability Statements and related materials must be received by the Contract Specialist, no later than August 3, 2009, at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time. Written responses received after this date and time will not be accepted. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on the responses received is solely within the discretion of the government. The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Address responses via email only to the attention of:  O. Joy Ajao, The National Institutes of Health, OLAO, Office of Acquisitions, email address: ajaooj@mail.nih.gov


                                             DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK

PROJECT TITLE:    Access to Elseviers Science Direct On-Line Services

I.	Statement of Work
A.	Background Information
For the past eleven years, the NIH Library has provided access to over 1300 journals in a wide range of scientific, technical and medical subjects through its contract with Elsevier for Science Direct. For the past five years, the contract also included access and use rights to the Scopus and EMBASE databases, online reference works, and hundreds of online books published or produced by Elsevier. Each year well over two million articles are downloaded from Science Direct by NIH researchers and hundreds of thousands of searches are conducted on the databases. Links from PubMed, Web of Science the Elsevier databases, and the NIH Library website allows NIH staff to connect directly to the articles in Science Direct following a search of the various sites. Science Direct and the other resources included in this contract allows DLS to provide enhanced and timely access to information NIH staff need to perform their work whether they are intramural researchers or extramural program administrators. Feedback from NIH and HHS researchers, clinicians and administrators  indicates that the easy accessibility of needed information made possible by providing electronic access to Elsevier  journals and the Scopus and Embase database through its Science Direct platform has increased their productive work time, because of the time saved identifying and retrieving relevant articles.

B.	Objectives

The specific objective of this requirement requires the contractor to continue to provide the NIH and the HHS agency staff served by the NIH Library (DLS) access to the electronic version of all Elsevier journals, including Cell Press titles, through its web interface Science Direct.  Access will be cumulative for articles published in the journals since 1997 or the first year a journal was offered on the Science Direct platform. The contractor is also required to continue to provide access to other databases and journals as outlined under the specific requirements section of this SOW.

II.	Services to be performed
A.	General Requirements
1.	Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment and facilities needed to perform the Statement of Work below.

2.	All work under this contract shall be monitored by the Project Officer.



B.	Specific Requirements
Specifically, the contractor shall:
1.	Provide the NIH and the HHS agency staff served by the NIH Library (DLS) access to the electronic version of all Elsevier journals, including Cell Press titles, through its web interface Science Direct.  Access will be cumulative for articles published in the journals since 1997 or the first year a journal was offered on the Science Direct platform.

2.	The contractor shall also provide options for continued unlimited access to Scopus for NIH and HHS staff, continued unlimited access to Embase for NIH staff, and the option of adding access to the Reaxys database for a select group of NIH researchers, primarily chemists.

3.	The contractor also shall provide options for acquiring e-books, online reference works, and backfiles of selected journals (journal articles published prior to 1997 or the first year a journal was offered on the Science Direct platform).

4.	The contractor shall provide an option for DLS to add new titles as the contractor adds to its holdings through acquisition or publication of a new title. The contractor also shall provide an option for DLS to cancel selected journal titles should its funding be reduced.

C.	Government Responsibilities

1.	The Government will be responsible for providing an interface via web links for the NIH community to access the Elsevier Science Direct website.
2.	NIH will be responsible for creating a system to validate security for entrance into the website.
3.	Upon signature by the Government, the contractor license agreement will be incorporated into the contract.
D.	Reporting Requirements and Deliverable
1.	The contractor shall regularly provide the Project Officer with monthly usage statistics for individual journal titles as well as aggregated use data for journals and databases. 

2.	Monthly use data shall be broken out separately for NIH and for the individual HHS agencies served by the NIH Library/DLS.

3.	 Use by selected NIH institutes may also be required when that use is identifiable, e.g. from IP range or log in.

<SUBJECT>Perform DNA Forensic Identification for Atlantic Billfish Species
<SOLNBR>NFFN7600-9-15495SLW
<RESPDATE>080309
<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>The NMFS intends to award a sole source purchase order to Dr. Mahmood Shivji, NOVA Southeastern University, Dania Beach, Florida to perform an extensive DNA forensic identification method to develop a highly streamlined assay for five Atlantic billfish species (blue marlin, white marlin, Atlantic sailfish, longbill spearfish, and roundscale shearfish) of primary management interest. These techniques (Pank et al. 2001; Shivji et al. 2002; Chapman et al. 2003; Abercrombie et al. 2005; Shivji et al. 2005; Clarke et al. 2006; and unpublished data) will provide a quick species identification capability for identifying adults at transshipment ports which have already been dressed at sea, without the normal compliment if identifiable parts to recognize adults. These techniques are suitable for identification of larvae, which are difficult to identify, particularly when they are less than 6 mm in length. Dr. Shivji is an internationally recognized leader in the area of developing molecular forensic techniques to problems of species identification in pelagic fisheries research, management and law enforcement. Dr. Shivji's laboratory is located in close proximity to the Southeast Fisheries Science Center, enabling rapid transfer of highly perishable billfish tissue. Dr. Shivji's laboratory, as the pioneer in development of the streamlined, multi-species forensic assay, is the only known source with direct experience to develop a similar forensic assay for billfish. The anticipated performance period is from date of award through twelve consecutive months thereafter. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications, and any additional supporting literature. Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the technical ability and demonstrated past experience to meet the requirements described in the description section above. Interested parties can send requests to the attention of Sharon Walker, at fax number 816-274-6983.<br />Vendor must provide a DUNS number (http://www.dnb.com/us/ ) and register with the Central Contractors Registration (http://www.ccr.gov/ ).

<DESC>1. This is a Sources Sought Synopsis ONLY.  Requests for copies of solicitation will not receive a response.<BR><BR>2.  The Joint Product Manager, Consequence Management (JPM-CM), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD is conducting market research to identify potential sources with the capability of providing Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive Detection Equipment (CBRNE) for use in the Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS), being developed by JPM-CM.  <BR><BR>3. CALS is based on a modular mobile laboratory concept that will consist of deployable modules that can be tailored to the specific needs of the specific consequence management laboratory units, Service Commanders, Joint Task Force - Civil Support (JTF-CS) and Joint Force Commander (JFC). CALS will be a transportable, mobile, multi-capability CBRNE system of system, based on open system architecture, and comprised of specific technologies to assist the warfighter and first responders in identifying CBRN hazards. CALS will be a modular, scalable, interoperable, and operationally integrated, mission-drive material solution for mobile lab analysis.  CALS will take a modular approach with respect to a smaller, deployable footprint consisting of flexible, adaptable, testable, plug n play capabilities; reduced power consumption; lighter, faster, and more accurate analytical equipment; net-centric, interoperable communications linked with external systems; more efficient laboratory processes, reduced personnel staffing; and expandable laboratory design.  <BR><BR>4.The CALS will provide a means to detect and quickly identify CBRNE materials in clinical specimens, environmental samples, and food samples; analyze, and provide field confirmatory and presumptive identification of threat agents, and genetically modified agents, to include low level biological warfare agents (BWA), chemical warfare agents (CWA), radiological material (RM), nuclear material (NM), high explosive residue (HER), toxic industrial compounds (TIC), and toxic industrial materials (TIM); and provide analytical results in an expedient manner to assist commanders in making risk management decisions about force protection measures to minimize the effects of a CBRNE event and allow the force to complete its mission.  <BR><BR>5. Pre-acquisition activities are currently underway to develop an acquisition strategy that minimizes the time and cost required to satisfy approved capability needs, and maximizes affordability throughout the program life-cycle. The initiation of the CALS Program is expected to begin in March 2010, with fielding expected to occur from 2013 through 2015.  Demonstration and selection of proposed capabilities is anticipated during the October 2009  September 2010 timeframe.<BR><BR>6. CALS capabilities will focus on:<BR>  <BR>	a.

<a href="mailto:john.r.swift@us.army.mil">John Swift</a>
<DESC>The United States Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions and Lethality Contracting Center, on behalf of  Product Manager Demilitarization (PM Demil), is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources that are capable of completing the research, development and proveout tasks on the Plasma Ordnance Demilitarization System (PODS), located at Hawthorne Army Depot (HWAD) in Hawthorne, NV, as well as preparing the PODS to the point of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), but will not actually include LRIP. PODS is a thermal treatment system that will be used for the demilitarization (destruction) of Military ordnance as a Closed Disposal Technology (CDT). PODS consists of a primary processing chamber followed by a series of interconnected pollution abatement equipment (PAE). Initial processing of ordnance occurs in the primary processing chamber (PPC), which is an enclosed, oxygen enriched reaction vessel heated by an internally mounted, Universal mode plasma arc torch. The torch, in addition to providing the heat to combust the ordnance, also melts co-fed soil and iron into a slag bath. Ordnance fed from the top of the PPC drops into the slag bath where it melts and combusts. Combustion gasses reach temperatures of up to 2,200 F and are continuously drawn off the PPC through the PAE train, which consists of an afterburner, a wet quench, a wet acid gas absorber, a wet high energy scrubber, a dry bag house, and a NOx catalytic reducer. Molten slag is periodically tapped into slag molds, cooled, and removed for disposal in a solid form. PODS is fully installed and has gone through extensive start-up testing with a variety of pyrotechnic ordnance (smoke, flare, and simulator).  A number of tasks are required to complete the research, development and proveout of PODS to the point where it is ready to initiate LRIP, which is the first operation in a sustained full scale production mode.   These tasks include resolution of remaining operability issues, optimization studies and improvements, a variety of operational testing (performance verification, environmental compliance), environmental and technical documentation support activities, and LRIP planning activities. Interested respondents should include information that provides evidence of experience in the following areas in a white paper format: 1.) Research, design, fabrication, start-up, developmental testing, troubleshooting, modification, and maintenance of plasma systems operating in an oxidizing environment for the purpose of demilitarization of a variety of fully assembled munitions containing various energetic fills (e.g., smoke, flare, simulator) at rates up to several hundred pounds per hour. 2.) Stationary hearth primary plasma chamber designs utilizing oxygen and water injection, and an oxidizing slag reaction medium.  3.) Experience and familiarity with operation, maintenance, design, and assembly of the Universal mode plasma torch and associated control system.  4.) Understanding of the creation and sustainment of a molten slag reaction medium using non-transferred and transferred torch operational modes for the processing of military ordnance with a variety of casing materials (e.g., aluminum, brass, copper, steel, stainless steel, plastic, cardboard) while maintaining proper slag chemistry (e.g., oxidation levels, silica and iron phase balance) and operating characteristics (e.g., leach resistance, viscosity, conductivity).  5.) Routine tapping and handling of molten slag including use of a burning bar bottom draw slag tap mechanism, slag containment and cooling to a solid form, and subsequent disposal. 6.) Operation and maintenance of start-of-the-art pollution abatement systems for low flow rate off gas comprising both wet and dry scrubbing systems for remediation of organics, NOx, particulate matter, volatilized metals, and acid gases. 7.) Resolution of high temperature (2,200F) off gas pipe plugging issues resulting from very high particulate loads generated by the processing of pyrotechnic munitions. 8.) Environmental compliance testing of incinerator systems in compliance with Clean Air Act and Nevada Division of Environmental Protection regulations, to include calibration drift, relative accuracy test audit, comprehensive performance testing, health risk assessment data collection, and Nevada State compliance testing. 9.) Technical documentation of plasma system operations to include operating and maintenance plans, design drawings, training plans, and start-up and shut-down checklists. 10.) Operational reviews and process analysis and evaluation to identify improvements to thermal treatment processes that increase system performance (e.g., reliability, throughput, operating cost). 11.) An awareness of the intricacies of operation and control of the PODS process, including troubleshooting issues, operating parameters, process chemistry, control interlocks, and operational issues. This market survey is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government. No award will be made as a result of this market survey. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. Interested sources should submit their qualification data and requested information no later than 1700 hrs EST on 05 August 2009 by email to john.r.swift@us.army.mil. Interested sources  may also submit their qualification data and requested information to JM&L Acquisition Center, ATTN: John R.

<DESC><p>Airborne Network Technology Review Days
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate of Rome, NY is participating in the 5thAnnual "Airborne Network Technology Review Days" to be conducted at the Radisson Hotel and Conference Center in Utica, New York on 11-13 August 2009, sponsored and hosted by the Erie Canal Chapter (NY) of the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association [AFCEA].</p>
<p>The objective of the Review Days is to provide a forum for industry and academia to discuss with government representatives the technologies required for formulation of the deployable airborne network(s). These Review Days will highlight approaches and current plans by the DoD to deploy airborne networks, the theme this year is "Making Today's Aerial Layer Challenges, Tomorrow's Tactical-Edge Advantage". Participants will have the opportunity to engage government leaders, researchers and scientists on approaches to solving the obstacles of networking airborne assets, review technology demonstrations, and discuss various experiments and practices. In addition to AFRL, Rome NY; NRL, Washington DC, and CERDEC, Ft Monmouth NJ, are also participating in this year's Airborne Network Technology Review Days conference.<br /><br />This year's Review Days feature notable addresses from: the Commander, Air Force Material Command, GENERAL Donald J. Hoffman; the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for C3, Space and Spectrum, Dr Ronald C. Jost; the Chief Engineer, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition, Mr Carl R. Siel; the Director, Joint Capability Development Directorate, Headquarters U.S. Joint Forces Command, Major General Kevin J. Kennedy, and the Director, Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate, Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center, Mr Henry J. Muller. There will also be overviews and technology briefs from the Military Services and DARPA, such as Dr Larry Stotts [DARPA-STO] and Dr Richard North [JPEO-JTRS] on their perspectives for implementing an airborne network; and technology presentations from government and non-government researchers. A "reality check" will be provided by two Air Force "Warfighters" who will talk about networking and its imperative for tactical advantage.</p>
<p>This year the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, Erie Canal Chapter, is hosting the Airborne Network Technology Expo 2009 in conjunction with the Review Days during the social hour on Wednesday evening, 12 August. The purpose of Expo 2009 is to provide industry, academia and government an additional opportunity to present their perspectives on advancing airborne network technology and to facilitate discussions. Due to space restrictions, Expo 2009 is limited to table top exhibits, Poster Boards and/or PowerPoint/PC Demo presentations. You may select one or any combination of the above exhibit methods. Each method of presentation MUST relate to advancing airborne network technology. Expo 2009 is being held at the Radisson Conference Center and space is limited so only two per company site will be allowed. Also because of the limited space, selection will be on a first received basis.</p>
<p>Additional AN Technology Review Days details, registration and Expo information can be found at: http://www.afceaeriecanal.com/index.html. Those wishing to reserve Expo space, please access the "Exhibitor Registration and Information Package" also available on that site.</p>
<p><br />Attendees must be US Citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens. Proof of status is required for registration. Clearances are not required and all discussions will be unclassified. Note: this is NOT a "bidder's conference" and this announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind. The Government will NOT assume liability for costs incurred by an offeror for presentations, marketing efforts or data offered for examination; therefore the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) anticipates a sole source (name brand) procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for the following requirement:
<p>One FOSS FoodScan Mean/Dairy Analyzer system with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).</p>
<p>The analysis of fat and moisture content are two of the main analytical tests performed by the USDA AMS -S&amp;T -National Science Laboratory (NSL) for USDA-AMS-Dairy Programs and USDA-AMS F&amp;V-Processed Products. These tests are performed in various agricultural commodities like raw meat, processed products like Meals-Ready-to-Eat (MRE's), and dairy products like non-fat dry milk (NDM). Historically, the NSL has utilized wet chemistry (Mojonnier) and gravimetric techniques (oven moisture) to test for fat and moisture respectively. Although reliable, these techniques are labor intensive and time consuming. The laboratories have a 5-day turn around requirement and have recently been unable to meet this requirement due to the volume of samples received. <br />The current fat analysis equipment that utilized for MRE testing uses methylene chloride, a harmful chemical for the environment, that is now obsolete.</p>
<p>The FOSS FoodScan Analyzer utilizes near infrared technology to analyze fat and moisture in meat and dairy samples in an automated manner without utilizing harmful chemicals or auxiliary lab equipment such as an oven or balance. It performs the analysis of both fat and moisture in about 1 minute (the current techniques require 1 hour for Mojonnier fat analysis and 6 hours for oven moisture analysis for an NDM sample).</p>
<p>The FoodScan has recently been approved by AOAC (Association of Official Analytical Chemists) international as an official method for fat and moisture analysis in dairy and meat samples.</p>
<p>Minimum requirements</p>
<p>1) Approved by the AOAC International as an official method for fat and moisture analysis in dairy and meat samples<br />2) NIT: scans samples in 850 - 1050 nm range<br />3) Analysis time: approximately 1 minute<br />4) Non-destructive test<br />5) Uses no chemicals in analysis or cleaning<br />6) Windows based software platform</p>
<p>Interested sources that are capable of providing the equivalent supply listed above are encouraged to submit statements of capability to the contracting office. Small business concerns are encouraged to participate. This is not a request for competitive proposals, but instead a market research method to determine interested sources. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive (i.e., non-brand name) procurement. Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature. Please provide past performance and references regarding your ability to provide this supply and service along with your Statement of Capability. The Government will not award a contract based on the information received, nor reimburse participants for information they provide. Information provided is strictly voluntary. Please email Statements of Capability Nathan Johnson <a href="mailto:Nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov">Nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Telephonic inquiries will not be honored. Closing date for submission of Statement's of Capability is Thursday, August 4th at 3:00 PM Central Standard Time. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 334516 with a small business size standard of less than 500 employees</p>

<DESC>The Alaska Region of the National Park Service intends to award a contract to Telonics, Inc. on a non-competetive basis.
The requirement is to refurbish ten (10) each TGW-3580, CLM, Cast 4 (full), TEMP-1, urethane over butyl belting with CR-2A Collar Release Mechanisms.
The National Park Service has purchased radio transmitter collars from Telonics, Inc under a previous contract (wolf research). The collars will be returned to Telonics, Inc at the end of the study period for refurbishment and subsequent reuse. Telonics, Inc is the only company that will refurbish its manufactured collars. Also, for data to be meaningful and comparative between wolf projects, resolution of data from collars (accuracy, fix rate, etc.) must be similar, therefore, it is imperative that any additional collars be configured in exactly the same manner as all other GPS collars that have been purchased for wolf monitoring.  Past market research and solicitations for the same and similar items have shown Telonics, Inc to have competitive pricing and the ability to provide a reliable, sturdy and quality product that is able to meet specific project requirements.
Award will be made on or after August 15, 2009. Contact person for questions is Deryl Morse at 907-644-3313 or email at deryl_morse@nps.gov. Award amount for the contract is anticipated to be $17,400.

    support M&M III.
4. Discussion of the procurement acquisition strategy for M&M III.
5. Discussion of the M&M III contract areas.

<p>Synopsis: <br /><br />THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WILL BE AWARDED TO A CONTRACTOR UNDER:</p>
<p>GSA Financial and Business Solutions Schedule (FABS) SIN 520-13, for<br />U.S. Dept of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Office of Audit, Assessment, and Management, Audit and Review Division (OAAM/ARD).</p>
<p>This procurement, under the stipulations and guidance for Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Office of Audit, Assessment, and Management, Audit and Review Division (OAAM/ARD) is requesting to add one (1) Internal Control Analyst - Financial Management position to the existing Watkins, Meegan, Drury and Company Contract (2007F_07125), which is in its Option Year I of a base year and four one year options in support of Internal Auditing Services efforts as a result of the Recovery and Reinvestment Act 2009 stimulus.</p>
<p>The Office of Justice Programs (OJP) initiated a Strategic Sourcing Initiative (SSI) to leverage spending to the maximum extent possible on various procurements. Strategic Sourcing is the collaborative and structured process of critically analyzing an organization's spending and using this information to make business decisions about acquiring commodities and services more effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p>OJP issued an RFQ with an A and B Series under the (SSI) on November 30, 2006 to vendors under the GSA Schedule Sin, 520-7 and 520-13, Financial and Business Solutions (FABS) schedule. As a result of the issuance of the RFQ, OJP received five (5) bid proposals that were evaluated by the panel members only with one vendor being selected for the A Series and another for the B Series. Due to all vendors receiving a marginal rating in at least one of their evaluation criteria meaningful, discussions were entered into. Upon completion of the second evaluation process there were two technically acceptable vendors.</p>
<p>The Contracting Office determined that Watkins, Meegan, Drury and Company should be selected for award based on the Cost/Technical Tradeoffs. <br />Based on all of the above it is in the best interest of the Government to modify the current contract with Watkins, Meegan, Drury and Company for services in lieu of<br />initiating a new procurement for the same services.</p>

Since award will be based on initial responses, offerors are encouraged to submit their most advantageous pricing in their initial response. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.

Interested parties capable of providing the requirement MUST submit a written quote to include their tax identification number (TIN), CAGE code, DUNS, firm evidence of their ability to perform, and any discount terms.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE REQUIREMENT.

This combined synopsis/solicitation is being prepared in accordance with the procedures and format of FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals have already been evaluated and no new ones are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is 4QBF21093209 and is issued as a Directed Buy for ColorID under ITSS at https://it-solutions.gsa.gov/.  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-26.  This will be a limited source procurement to small business concern ColorID, LLC. per their Schedule # GS-25F-0139M, SIN #20 316, Cameras and Accessories.

This is a sole-source requirement for a new Identification Badge system to replace the system currently in use at Womack Army Medical Center (WAMC).  The identification badge system is instrumental and vital to WAMCs mission in identifying medical, non-medical, command and official visitor personnel in the MEDCEN.  Additionally, the use of badges is a Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) requirement.  It has been determined that this combined synopsis/solicitation falls under 6.302-2  Unusual and compelling urgency.  It has been determined that the agencys need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for.  A delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government.  Several vendors presented WAMC with solutions to the request for a new Identification Badge System at a site visit, held on April 28, 2009.  WAMC received a total of 3 offers from the potential sources that responded to the sources sought.  Vendors are requested not to contact the client.

GSA has performed additional market research and has determined that acquisition alternatives include GSA Schedules and Open Market items.  The results of the E-Buy RFI #RFQ366452 have shown that the appropriate solution can be found under Schedule 67.

The deliverable due date is 30 days ARO.  Delivery will be made to:

Mr. Donald Brooks

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-30.     

This announcement constitutes the only 100% small business set aside solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 541711, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures. Any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services.  A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.  

Award will be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government may award this contract to other than the lowest price technically acceptable quote.  The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor described to "Meet or Exceed the Requirement," 2) Past Performance and 3) Price.  Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for biotechnology research and development services.  The Statement of Work is as follows:

Performance Work Statement

The purpose of the test is to quantify activity of multiple signal transduction pathways in biological samples including mouse skin, liver, muscle, and lungs. Quantification activity of a minimum of 50 transcription factors in a uniform assay is needed to create a comprehensive profile of response of biological tissues to treatment with adjuvants.
FDA will provide samples which the Contractor will process using FACTORIAL method, in vitro assay.  The Contractor will provide relative activities of 51 transcription factors currently included in their panel.  The processing involves nucleic acids isolation, RT-PCR amplification of Factorial plasmids, restriction digestion and electrophoretic identification of the DNA products.  Includes experimental setup, production and assembly of endotoxin-free Factorial plasmid library, assaying the tracer luciferase in blood samples, isolation, quantification and assessing the quality of total RNA preparations performing Factorial detection for determining reporter RNAs profiles (30 samples in triplicates, total of 90 detection conditions), calculation of the TF activity profiles and statistical assessments of the results.
Signals that control genome expression are executed through coordinated changes in the activities of transcription factors (TFs) - proteins that bind gene regulatory elements and modulate transcription. Mammalian genomes encode about 2000 TFs that, according to DNA binding similarities, can be classified into few hundred families. By analyzing activities of multiple TFs one should be able to obtain an informative snapshot of gene regulatory network. However, high-content analysis of TFs requires adequate tools. 

Assays that make use of reporter gene constructs (e.g., luciferase reporters) can be used to analyze only one or two transcription factors at a time. In contrast, DNA-binding assays can potentially be used to assess multiple transcription factors, but provide limited biological information because DNA binding is only one of many factors in the regulation of transcription factor activity.

The Contractor shall conceptualize and developed a simple homogeneous assayenabling assessment of multiple transcription factors activities in a single experiment.

The services are to be performed at the Contractors facility.  

The deliverables are to be sent to 5516 Nicholson Lane Kensington, MD 20895.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for the development of dissolution method strategies with an in vivo-in vitro correlation for formulations of poorly soluble compounds.

General Duties/Description of Work

Background

Realization of the QbD paradigm requires a systematic framework for developing dissolution methods for poorly soluble compounds.  Characterizing the drug-release mechanism by establishing an in vitro dissolution test method to measure product performance is particularly important for poorly soluble compounds. For a development compound, dissolution testing is used primarily to help develop and evaluate new formulations by evaluating the rate of drug release from dosage forms, evaluating the stability of these formulations, monitoring product consistency, assessing formulation changes, and establishing In-vitro In-vivo relationships or correlations (IVIVRs or IVIVCs respectively). One of the most difficult aspects of drug development of poorly soluble compounds is the development of appropriate dissolution methods for these systems. In many cases, the parent molecule crystallizes during the dissolution test making the rate of dissolution abnormally slow. Thus, for poorly soluble compounds, dissolution tests are often empirically derived and may have no relationship to product quality. Because of this empiricism, the meaning and significance of dissolution failures is not clear. In such cases achieving quality by design is not possible. Without dissolution methods, formulation design and development is also not possible. Additionally, specifications may not be reflective of product quality or manufacturing reproducibility. 
For a commercial product, dissolution testing is used primarily to confirm manufacturing and product consistency, to evaluate the quality of the product during its shelf life, and to assess post-approval changes and the need for bio-equivalency studies. 

Objective

The long range goal of this work is to establish a new toolkit for developing dissolution tests that are reflective of in-vivo performance of formulations of poorly soluble drugs. This toolkit involves: (1) the use of surfactant screens to select the best media; (2) Small-scale tests will be carried out to assess the effect of crystallization of the parent drug during the test; (3) An additive screen to find an additive to prevent premature crystallization; (4) Scale up of the method and testing at full scale; and (5) comparison of dissolution data to in-vivo results. This toolkit will provide technologies to develop a QbD dissolution test which correlates with in vivo blood levels of the drug (IVIVC in-vitro in-vivo correlation).  The goal of this contract is to establish preliminary feasibility of the strategy. This study is important because of the recent emphasis on quality by design.

The contractor will focus on the poorly soluble drug itraconazole.  Although there are 4 common approaches to preparing a formulation of poorly soluble drugs with enhanced bioavailability: (1) cocrystals, (2) amorphous forms, (3) salts, and (4) nanocrystals, this project will focus on amorphous forms.   This study is aimed at determining the feasibility of an in vitro dissolution method that is reflective of in-vivo performance of amorphous dispersions of itraconazole.  The contractor will carry out a model dissolution test development project on itraconazole dispersions.  Stability of these formulations will be determined using stress testing designed by the contractor with approval of the FDA COTR.    This amorphous dispersion will be scaled-up and then this dispersion will be subjected to a surfactant screen and a solvent screen.  The preference is to use a surfactant in water system.  The appropriate solvents and surfactants will then be screened for crystallization potential.  In this study the solutions produced during the dissolution test will be stirred for 8 hours and the extent of crystallization measured visually.  Amorphous itraconazole without polymers will be used as the control.  Various polymers (at least 2) will be screened for their ability to prevent crystallization in an 8 hour test.  In this test the solutions after dissolution will be stirred for 8 hours and observed/analyzed for crystallization.  The timeframe may be adjusted if needed.  The ability of this inhibitor to prevent crystallization at a given concentration (e.g. 10%) will be determined, initially in a simple yes-no test.  Amorphous itraconazole will be used as the control.

2.2	Microfilm Sub Photo - Convert each image or item on each page of each album to 16mm microfilm except in cases where 35mm microfilm is required because of the size of the image.  Each microfilm image must be identified with the book number and page number and image number.

(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and
(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

[_] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that is has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.
(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly
(1) [_] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or 
(2) [_] Outside the United States.
(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]
(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that
(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;
(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and

(2) [_] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that
(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;
(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)
(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offerors relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p><br />Description</p>
<p>This is a synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared with the format under Simplified Acquisition Procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items; and FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotations (RFQ) NLM-09-118-SV. This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect in the April 2009 Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis. This acquisition IS a 100% small business set-aside and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 519120, Libraries and Archives Services.</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) owns over 40,000 monographs printed prior to 1923 in the Americas (Canada, the Caribbean, Latin America, Mexico, and the United States). NLM plans to digitize these items as part of a mass digital preservation project, called Medicine in the Americas. In 2007, NLM conducted a pilot project which revealed that the availability of consistent metadata prior to digitization promotes efficiency during the actual digitization workflow.</p>
<p>According to a random survey of Americana titles conducted in 2008, almost 80% of these monographs have cataloging records that lack Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms. Many of these records were created prior to the implementation of the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (2nd edition, revised). Though a minority of the titles have full-level AACR2 records that contain MeSH terms, most do not; tens of thousands of records must be upgraded to meet the current national standard for full-level cataloging and ensure the consistency that is required for optimal metadata transfer into NLM's digital repository.</p>
<p>Additionally, some Medicine in the Americas monographs do not have distinct cataloging records in Voyager. Decades ago, NLM used a single record approach for cataloging titles that appeared in multiple editions. Although many of these "multiple-edition records" have been recataloged over the years to meet the current standard of one record per edition, there are still several hundred editions that need separate records. These titles should have full-level AACR2 records created for them in Voyager, either by using available OCLC copy or by creating an original record from scratch.</p>
<p>Approximately 75% of the Medicine in the Americas works are written in English, with about 15% in Spanish, and less than 10% in French or German. A very small percentage is written in a variety of other languages.</p>
<p>The vendor shall perform the following activities:</p>
<p>A. Confirm that there is only one bibliographic record for a title in the Voyager database and evaluating what type of cataloging work is necessary: none; record creation for uncataloged titles; single record upgrade; recataloging of multiple edition records; and/or holding and item record maintenance, including the linking of bound-together titles; <br />B. Identify whether single edition records have been cataloged according to full-level AACR2 standard, including a full complement of MeSH terms;<br />C. Upgrade single edition records to full-level AACR2 standard, according to NLM specifications;<br />D. Create separate bibliographic records for uncataloged titles and editions cataloged on multiple-edition records, either by using available OCLC copy or by creating an original record directly in Voyager;<br />E. Confirm that all name headings used in the upgraded or created records have corresponding fully established AACR2 authority records in Voyager; <br />F. Ensure that all bibliographic records have accurate holdings and item records, according to NLM specifications, including proper linking of bound-together titles'<br />Provide Project Officer with proper documentation of upgraded and newly created bibliographic and authority records.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall upgrade or create records in accordance with the standards outlined in the MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data, the Anglo American Cataloging Rules (2nd ed., 2002 rev, latest update), and the Library of Congress Rule Interpretations, modified to NLM's local specifications. Holdings and item record data shall be verified and/or input according to the NLM Guidelines for Interpreting, Creating, and Maintaining Holdings Records and the NLM Guidelines for Interpreting, Creating and Maintaining Item Records, as modified to local HMD specifications.</p>
<p>All work shall be performed in accordance with accepted principles of the NLM's quality standards, MeSH and NLM policies and in adherence to MARC21.</p>
<p>This is a performance based effort. The purchase order period of performance will be for a 12-month Base Period of approximately August 7, 2009 through August 6, 2010, with one additional 12-month Option Period and three 12-month Award Period, on a Labor Hour basis [FAR 16.602]; at a not to exceed level of 15,00 labor hours per 12-month period.</p>
<p>The following clauses and provisions cited herein are incorporated by reference into this solicitation and may be obtained from the web site http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/SAP/sap.htm: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial (June 2008), and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (October 2008). The attached Addendum to Terms and Conditions of Purchase Order also applies to this solicitation. FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (January 1999), also applies with the following three evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of the provision: (1) Must have a Master of Library Science degree from an ALA-accredited institution and at least 3 years experience providing original cataloging data according to national standards, including AACR2r, LCRIs, and MARC; experience creating authority records according to AACR2 desired; demonstrated proficiency in reading English and one other Western European language, preferably French, German, and/or Spanish at the college level; and knowledge of assigning MeSH to 19th century historical materials and the Voyager cataloging module is preferred; (2) Offerors should illustrate its reputation for professional excellence in cataloging and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction. References, with names of persons with knowledge of offeror's past performance and their current telephone number, should be provided in support of the offeror's past performance.

Experience of Personnel is more important than Past Performance and Past Performance is more important than Management Ability.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

Solicitation number CFOM-09-SO-0177 is issued as a Request For Quotation (RFQ) under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (FAR Subpart 13.5). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-34. This procurement is not a set-aside. All responsible sources may submit a quotation. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541410 with a small business size standard of $7.0 million.

All deliverables shall be shipped F.O.B. Destination. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors&mdash;Commercial, applies to this acquisition. There are no addenda applicable to the provision. The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation&mdash;Commercial Items, is applicable to this procurement. The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of that provision are: (1) Merits of the Proposed CAFM System; (2) Corporate Experience and Past Performance; (3) Qualifications of the Proposed Key Person; and (4) Price.

As part of this evaluation, CFTC may also conduct a price realism analysis. CFTC may award the contract to other than the lowest priced offeror. The above technical criteria are listed in declining order of importance. From the standpoint of the relative importance of price to the technical criteria, the technical criteria, when combined, are significantly more important than price. However, as the merit of technical factors in competing quotations approaches equality, price will become increasingly more significant as an evaluation factor. Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications&mdash;Commercial Items, with its quotation. The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions&mdash;Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. There are no addenda applicable to the clause.

For each option year, breakout the proposed firm-fixed-price by illustrating all system-related items (i.e., software/licenses and maintenance/support). Also, if additional system modules are available, but have not been proposed as part of the solution, please also provide their pricing (i.e., license and annual maintenance costs) for informational purposes only. The CFTC expects to evaluate quotations and award a contract without conducting discussions and/or soliciting quotation revisions. Therefore, the offeror&rsquo;s initial quotation should contain the offeror&rsquo;s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, CFTC reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the CFTC Contracting Officer to be necessary.

The Contractor, as an independent Contractor and not as an agent of the Government, shall provide the necessary personnel, facilities, material, equipment and services to accomplish the tasks as defined in this SOW.  The period of performance is 210 days from the date of award.   <BR>C.2	<BR>Basic Performance Requirements.  The Contractor shall meet all of the following performance requirements and the following milestones.<BR>a.	SOW meeting				15 days after contract award(DAC)                 <BR>b.	Critical Design Review			no later than 60 DAC<BR>c.	Test Readiness Review			no later than 120 DAC<BR>d.	Notice to Commence Impact Test		no later 2 weeks prior<BR>e.

Each coupon shall consist of the following recipe:<BR><BR>1	0.236	Annealed water white (low iron) clear glass<BR>2	0.025	Urethane Interlayer Huntsman PE 399<BR>3	0.388	Annealed water white clear glass<BR>4	0.025	Urethane Interlayer Huntsman PE 399<BR>5	0.388	Annealed water white clear glass<BR>6	0.025	Urethane Interlayer Huntsman PE 399<BR>7	0.490	Annealed water white clear glass<BR>Each glass ply shall be cut to the lateral dimension +/- .25 inches.  The edges shall be sanded prior to bonding into the stack.  The edges shall not be treated (coated) because of the lateral stacking allowances.  The stack shall be bonded in a manner consistent with safety glass manufacturing methods and shall be inspected by the Contractor at normal incidence and the inclusions and voids visible to the eye, etc. at two meters shall be cause for rejection of that coupon. The Contractor shall mark layer #1 above as the strike face.<BR>C.4	<BR> The Contractor shall fabricate 600 each transparent test coupons that are 4 x 4 inches.  Each coupon shall consist of the following recipe:<BR><BR>1	0.388	Glass ceramic<BR>2	0.025	Urethane Interlayer Huntsman PE 399<BR>3	0.388	Annealed water white clear glass<BR>4	0.025	Urethane Interlayer Huntsman PE 399<BR>5	0.388	Annealed water white clear glass<BR>6	0.025	Urethane Interlayer Huntsman PE 399<BR>7	0.388	Annealed water white clear glass<BR><BR>Each glass ply shall be cut to the lateral dimension +/- .25 inches.  The edges shall be sanded prior to bonding into the stack.  The edges shall not be treated (coated) because of the lateral stacking allowances.  The stack shall be bonded in a manner consistent with safety glass manufacturing methods and shall be inspected at normal incidence.  Inclusions and voids visible to the eye shall be cause for rejection of that coupon. The Contractor shall mark layer #1 above as the strike face.<BR>C.5	 <BR>Each coupon that is tested shall be struck with one impactor (ceramic ball).  The Contractor shall use both of two diameter balls, but each coupon configuration shall be struck 24 times.  Thus, the total of required tests is: 24 repeats (times) 2 ball diameters (times) 12 speeds, see later in this Para, (times) 2 coupon styles (equals) 1152 individual impacts, 576 of each size of coupon.  See paragraph 10 regarding remaining coupons.  The Contractor shall launch a 6mm or a 12mm ball in such a manner that the coupon is struck by only the ball.  Ball diameter is approximate but should be consistent.  For example, quarter and half inch balls such as standard, very high temperature, high-alumina ceramic balls found in industrial catalogues are permitted if they are from the same manufacturers lot.  <BR><BR>The Contractor shall launch a 6 (or 12) mm ceramic ball into each strike face (layer 1), within a 1.18  zone centered on the strike face of each coupon. Impact velocities shall be varied between 40-150 fps +/- 6 fps (27-102 miles per hour). Velocity increments of 10 fps +/- 6 fps shall be used.   24 coupons shall be tested at each increment and ball diameter, i.e. 24 coupons at 40 fps with 6mm diameter balls, 24 coupons at 40 fps with 12mm diameter balls, 24 coupons at 50 fps with 6mm diameter etc. continuing up to 150 fps for both sizes of ceramic balls.   Note, the coupons may be tested in any order of size and velocity.  If all impacts are acceptable tests this would result in 576 of both the 6 x 6 and 4 x 4 coupons being consumed.  The remaining 24 of each size may be used by the Contractor to correct any missing or invalid tests.  See Para 10.<BR>C.6	<BR>The Contractor shall characterize each coupon following impact.  The Contractor shall record the striking speed, the type of fracture or failure induced.  The Contractor shall use terms which differentiate the type of failures such as: none, pit of diameter xx or extensive lateral cracking and in which layer the cracks exist and if the lateral cracks do not extend to the lateral edge, the diameter that would circumscribe the cracks.  The Contractor may use more descriptive terminology (categories) at his discretion, but all descriptions shall be defined by the Contractor.   The Contractor is not limited to the terminology described in this paragraph.<BR>C.7	<BR>Upon completion of impact testing, the coupons shall be thermally shock tested according to Method 503.4, Procedure 1-C of MIL-STD-810 from -31C to +63C +/- 2C. The thermal cycle shall consist of a minimum 4 hour period at minus 31C +/- 3C followed by a minimum 4 hour period at +63C +/- 3C with this cycle being repeated for a total of 5 cycles. The transfer time between temperature conditions shall be no longer than one minute. Upon completion of temperature shock testing, the individual samples shall be evaluated by the Contractor to determine and document evidence of, at a minimum,<BR>-	thermal shock extension of any flaws induced in impact testing<BR>-	type/category and maximum depth of any chips (Para. 6)<BR>-	evidence of cracking resulting from thermal cycling only<BR>-	evidence of delamination via dye penetration along the edges<BR>-	depth and length of cracking and if applicable the  diameter to circumscribe the cracking (Para. 6)<BR><BR>C.8	 <BR>The Government may witness any or all of the testing and data recording. Additionally, the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) or the CORs designate shall inspect all of the coupons both before and after testing to assure that the minimum number and quality of coupons are fabricated and that the data of the individual impacts are correctly recorded.  The Contractor shall provide the COR at least two weeks notice in advance of impact testing.<BR>C.9	 <BR>Reviews:  The Contractor shall provide a list of all coupons by serial number prior to the beginning of testing.  Each impact test shall have a separate data sheet that must be presented with the coupons and traceable to the data analyses.  The data sheet shall include: target serial number, ball diameter, measured ball speed, sketch of damage, date tested, date target was manufactured and any phenomenological anomalies.  The Contractor shall give weekly updates of the serial numbered coupons that have been impacted to the COR.  This shall be by e-mail or other method in accordance with DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL, Data Item no. A004).<BR>C.10	 <BR>Deliverables:  The Contractor shall provide a final report in a Word" 2007 readable format within 30 days after all testing is complete (CDRL A006), but no later than 210 days after contract award.  The report must include pictures of the coupon representing the average (or normal or expected) damage induced for each given ball diameter, speed, and coupon size.  In other words, the final report must give a representative picture for each 24 coupon set.  The report need not give a detailed analysis of each damaged coupon.  The Contractor must provide the data sheets for each test.  These data sheets may be an appendix to the final report or may be provided separately.  Note the testing scheme requires 576 coupons of both Para. 3 and 4 coupons.  Excess coupons may be used by the Contractor to replace invalid test data.  Invalidated testing shall be documented and reported.  Excess coupons shall be deliverable to the Government.  The tested coupons shall be grouped by size of coupon, ball diameter, and speed and crated in such a way that the serial number is traceable to the test data sheet.  Crating shall prevent further deterioration of the coupons such that the detailed in-house (Government) analysis may accurately reflect that the same trends documented in the Contractors final report can be verified.  All coupons shall be received by the Government no later than 60 days after completion of testing.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

It sounds like they want rope to the operations level.  Is this what they want?  Also, what level do they want the vehicle extrication training to be to?  Explanation.  The NFPA 1006 standard only certifies to the technician level.  There is no way to certify to the Operational level.  <BR><BR><BR>Answer.  We need to be certified to the level that would allow us to receive the DoD Rescue I certification.<BR><BR>5.Question.  Is the Department looking to apply for reciprocity over to the DoD Rescue Technician I?<BR><BR>Answer:  Yes<BR><BR>6. Question.  If they are wanting the DoD RT-1 they need confined space rescue also.  Do they already have this training?<BR><BR>Answer:  We already have the Confined Space Certifications.<BR><BR>7. Question.  Do they have all the rope rescue equipment needed for the class and is it within the NFPA 1983 standards.  Explanation.  They talk about vehicle tools but nothing about rope equipment.<BR><BR>Answer:  Yes.  We have all equipment for both disciplines.<BR><BR>8.Question.  You talk about a train the trainer classes.  Are they looking for a T-N-T class?  Explanation.  NFPS does not have a certification for T-N-T.  I do not do a T-N-T program because of insurance issues. <BR> <BR>Answer:  We are not looking for a TNT.<BR><BR>9.Question.  On the contract under statement of work #6a., it states that the Government will provide classroom, training space, vehicles, props and tools needed to cut vehicles.  It does not say anything about ropes and equipment needed for rope rescue.  Is this needed?<BR><BR>Answer.  All ropes equipment will be provided by the Government.<BR><BR>10. Question.  Under statement of work #6b.1., Rope rescue awareness and operations, it states that they are seeking a basic, operations (not technical) level rope class.  But, it says the cirriculum shall meet NFPA 1006 Chapter 6 which is the chapter for Rope Technician.  Chapter 5 of 1006 covers the basic requirements needed prior to Chapter 6.  This is generally known as the Introduction class to my knowledge.  Are they seeking an Introduction to Technical Rescue class or a Rope Rescue Technician class?<BR><BR>Answer.  We need the NPQ certification for ropes, if that means we need the technical level class then that is what we need to be taught.<BR><BR>11.Question.  Will the group being tested be just Vehicle and Machinery and Rope and have general requirements or another level of NFPA 1006 already?  Also is the Train the Trainer required?<BR><BR>Answer.  No.   The Train the Trainer is required for us.  <BR><BR>All responses must be received no later than 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on 23 July 2009.

Enforcement Technology Program
10720 Richmond Highway, Suite N
Lorton, VA 22079

We have issued this RFQ to you and to other contractors.  If you decide to respond, your quotation must be in full compliance with the attached instructions in this RFQ

In addition to this letter; this RFQ includes the following attachments:

The Government reserves the right to award without discussion; therefore each offeror is encouraged to submit their best terms with their proposal.     Special attention is directed to FAR 52.212-1 (b).     Failure to submit the required information for evaluation may render the offer non-responsive.   Offerors shall include a fully executed copy of the FAR provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with their offer.    FAR clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (NOVEMBER 1999)

The government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at rates specified in the contract.  These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rated provided by the Secretary of Labor.  The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension shall not exceed 6 months.  The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days of the current performance period end date.

Evaluation Criteria

The proposal evaluation and discussion procedures in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, contracting by negotiation, does not apply to this acquisition.  Therefore we will not use those procedures. The Government will not establish a competitive range; conduct "discussions" with all offerors within a competitive range, or request final proposal revisions ("best and final offers") from offerors. The basis of award shall be best value. After receiving quotations, the Government may request additional oral or written information from one or more offerors, but not necessarily from all offerors.

Basis for Award:  

a.  The Government will make an award resulting from the Request for Quote (RFQ) to the responsible offeror(s) whose quote(s), conforming to the Statement of Work (SOW), will provide the Best Value to the Government, technical, price and other factors considered.  The Government may select for award the offeror whose total ceiling price is not necessarily the lowest, but whose overall proposal is deemed sufficiently more advantageous to the Government so as to justify the payment of a higher ceiling price.  Conversely, the Government may select for award the offeror whose total ceiling price is the lowest, when other proposals are not sufficiently more advantageous so as to justify the payment of a higher ceiling price.

b.	The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a delivery order without communications with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain its best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to make clarifications or request revised quotes if later determined by the Contacting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in the submitted quotes.

C. Relative Importance of Evaluation Criteria:
The Government considers Technical Approach to represent the strongest indication of successful achievement of contractual objectives; technical approach is more important than Past Performance and Price. When combined Technical Approach and Past Performance is more important than price.

Past Performance Questionnaire:

Each Offeror is required to send a Past Performance Questionnaire (see attachment ) to at a minimum the three (3) past performance references list in their quote under past performance history references.  Using the past performance Rating Scale (see attachment) the Listed Past Performance reference information shall include at a minimum: company name, point of contact, phone/fax/e-mail information.  All Offeror references must complete the survey and email the survey to the contract specialist Ebrima Conteh at ebrima.conteh@dhs.gov no later than 1:00 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST), August 03, 2009.  Each Offeror is responsible for coordinating with their referenced customers to ensure that completed past performance questionnaires are submitted to the Contract Specialist Ebrima Conteh at ebrima.conteh@dhs.gov  no later than the above referenced date/time. 
Instructions for Submitting Your Quote

If an Offeror intends to respond to this solicitation and has questions concerning the solicitation and its requirements; the deadline for submitting questions is 1.00 PM Eastern Standard Time July 27, 2009.

Offerors shall submit their quote electronically to Ebrima Conteh, Contract Specialist (email: ebrima.conteh@dhs.gov ) by 1 PM Eastern Standard Time August 03, 2009.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FORPROPULSION SUBSYSTEM PRESSURE TRANSDUCER.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s)in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ anda written amendment will not be issued.The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions received in response to thesolicitation. The questions and responses are as follows:1. The following is an exception we would like to request pertaining to specificationGPM-PROP-SPEC-0027:The specification calls for two different dash numbers/pressure ranges: a 0-200 psi MEOPtransducer (-02), and a 0-400 psi MEOP transducer (-01). We would like to request anexception to specification GPM-PROP-SPEC-0027 for the 0-200 psi MEOP transducer (-02).The specification calls for the proof pressure of both transducers to be 1200 psi. Isuspect this is an effort to mitigate potential damage from water hammer effects in thefuel system. We would like to change the proof pressure to 900 psi for the 200 psi MEOP(-2) transducer. Our pressure transducers include a snubber to help mitigate water hammereffects; I can provide detailed information on the snubber if it is deemed necessary.Due to GPM propulsion design changes recently made, the water hammer effects are nolonger an issue for the pressure transducers. Both dash numbers/pressure ranges (0-200psi MEOP transducer (-02), and a 0-400 psi MEOP transducer (-01)) will be required tomeet a proof pressure of 600 psi, not 1200 psi. 2. Do you require electrical isolation of the input to output of the instrument?Yes, GPM pressure transducers require electrical isolation.3. Will a competitive offer that includes a custom qualification program be consideredequal to/or better than a previously qualified instrument which does not fully satisfythe posted requirements?A custom qualification program that completely meets GPM requirements will be consideredbetter than a previously qualified instrument which does not fully satisfy the postedrequirements. However, if there are valid cost cutting alternatives or suggestions, addthese as options into your proposal for consideration. 4. Will milestone billing be considered?Yes.The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASAAcquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 07/10/2009.

<DESC>CLARIFICATIONS & TIME EXTENSION
Question 1:  Part 2 of the Description states, Two 30-day data collection sessions occurred in two different seasons Additionally observer logging sites / source identification were recorded in accordance with section2.0 of the AASRMG. Is it correct to assume that there are four total 25-day sets of datatwo measurement sites with two sets of data supplemented by observer logs? If not, how many measurement sites are included in each session and ultimately how many 25-day sets will be included for analysis?
ANSWER 1:   Yes, four total sets of data as assumed
Question 2:  Is it possible to receive a copy of the NPS Natural Sounds Program ambient sound analysis software at this time in order to review prior to submitting our proposal? 
ANSWER 2: Yes, we can provide a fully functional test version for prior review.
Question 3:  How many monitoring sites?  The solicitation explains that data was collected in two 30-day sessions and that there are two ORV areas.  It does not specify whether there was more than one monitoring site in each ORV area.
ANSWER 3:  Measurements were collected over two sampling periods: November/December 2008 and February/March 2009. The park has lower activity in late fall, so the Nov/Dec measurements are representative of the park low-use or "quiet" condition. The Feb/Mar measurements were conducted during the Sand Drags event, which is representative of peak use. The first measurement range was from 12 Nov 2008 through 10 Dec 2008 and the second measurement range from 16 Feb 2009 through 19 Mar 2009.
Five sites were selected for noise monitoring. Noise levels were measured via Larson Davis 831 sound level meters (SLM). Two sites were located in the Blue Creek region of the park and three in Rosita. Two of the sites (one in each region) had audio recorders capturing continuously. Weather stations, one in each region, were set to collect wind speed, wind gust, wind direction, temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure. The datum is WGS84.

The proposal due date has been extended to 4:00 PM MDT on Monday, July 27, 2009.

We fully understand that USACE would not likely permit a project to be administered as well as performed by the same company.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;********** End of Notice*******************</p>
<p>Solicitation: Project ZHTV0700191. This RESTRICTED ACQUISITION is set aside for HUBzone concerns. The Period of Performance is 300 days.</p>
<p>NAICS CODE: 236220. Size Standard $33.5M Renovate Facility Phase 1, Facility 20011. This project is phase I of a multi-phase whole building renovation plan. This phase includes complete replacement of all air handling units, the heat exchanger, electrical distribution switchboard and circuit breakers. All restrooms will be completely replaced, some in different locations than the existing. A new sanitary sewer line will be installed. The site of the work is Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.</p>
<p>Special Requirement/Considerations: The building will remain occupied during this construction. Many of the new utility lines will be above the ceiling in the corridor requiring the contractor to plan his work to meet fire safety requirements for egress. The air handler and associated ductwork replacement will need to be accomplished during the no heat/no cool time of the year requiring the contractor to plan ahead to have all his material on the site before he begins demolition. The restroom work will be phased to allow the occupants to have access to at least one working restroom at all times during the construction. All this phasing of work will require the contractor to be able to manage multiple disciplines in order to minimize detrimental effects to building occupants. Constant communication with the building occupants and the fire department will be critical. The main occupants of this building are Air Force lawyers and the OSI. An unscheduled power outage could cause a mission impact for these organizations and therefore is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Estimated Cost of proposed Acquisition is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 4.1102 and DFARS 252.204-704 "Required Central Contractor Registration," Contractor must be registered in CCR prior to award. Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov/ , or 1-888-CCR-2423 Fax: 1-703-696-0213.</p>

<DESC>A. Background

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals for a contractor to provide Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition CFSAN with a broad overview of the presence, frequency and levels of microbial pathogens in foods with emphasis on produce commodities. Outbreaks due to the contamination of produce have received a heightened interest from the American public.   

B. Scope of Work 

The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) has specific regulatory responsibilities directed at ensuring the safety of food, food additive, dietary supplement, and cosmetic products.  In part, CFSAN maintains an active research program for the purpose of developing and applying technologies to detect, to identify and evaluate microbial hazards that may contaminate products either naturally or intentionally. 

This contract is intended to provide CFSAN with a broad overview of the presence, frequency and levels of microbial pathogens in foods with emphasis on produce commodities. Outbreaks due to the contamination of produce have received a heightened interest from the American public. This contract should provide significant data on the prevalence of selected bacterial pathogens in a wide variety of produce commodities and a broad view of the presence of Salmonella in tomatoes.  The overarching objectives of this contract are to provide significant baseline data of potential microbiological hazards associated with the consumption of raw and minimally processed produce and to identify other microbial-related environmental and food-related risks.  

In order to better understand how pervasive microbial pathogens are in fresh produce commodities the objective of this contract is to analyze selected foods for the presence of Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli O157:H7.  As for ready-to-eat (RTE) foods, our focus will be on Listeria monocytogenes. Our plans include the generation of a database for these select produce as to the frequency of isolation/detection of the aforementioned pathogens in each commodity as it relates to its geographical location and growing season. 

The emphasis of this contract is to focus on obtaining data that will reflect a broader scope of the frequency and levels of bacteriological human pathogens that have historically been associated with fresh produce commodities and a variety of RTE foods. In order to better understand how pervasive microbial pathogens are in fresh produce commodities the objective of this contract is to analyze selected foods for the presence of Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli O157:H7.  As for RTE foods, our focus will be on Listeria monocytogenes. Our plans include the generation of a database for these select produce as to the frequency of isolation/detection of the aforementioned pathogens in each commodity as it relates to its geographical location and growing season. 

The impact of such data collection could have an affect on any Produce Safety Regulatory Options Developed by FDA with the following parameters: Consistent across the U.S., based on sound science, overarching (most commonly consumed fresh produce), accommodate specifics (commodity, region, operations, practices, size of establishment), and allow the U.S. to meet its obligations under WTO SPS.

C. Additional Information 

 It is anticipated that one (1)  Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be awarded with a one (1) year base period and four (4) option years. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). FDA anticipates release of the RFP on or around July 22, 2009 and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is on or before or after September 19, 2009.


This notice has been amended to provide a release date of the solicitation from on or around May 8 to an exact release date of July 22, 2009.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services at the American Embassy in Cotonou, Benin. The U.S. Embassy Cotonou requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement. The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks. Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government).


All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. 


The Project Manager must possess a Level 3 language proficiency, which requires an ability to speak English with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations on practical, social, and professional topics. 


The Government plans to post the solicitation in this site on or about July 21, 2009. No paper copies will be mailed. The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: The synopsis will be posted for approximately fifteen (15) days. Once the solicitation announcement closes on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit proposals. All dates are subject to change. Offerors will be notified.


A site visit is tentatively scheduled approximately fifteen (15) days after the solicitation opens, at the U.S. Embassy and their facilities in Cotonou. A firm date will be announced at the time the solicitation is posted.  Offerors are responsible for entry visa, all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations in Cotonou. Due to space limitations, only two (2) representatives from each firm will be allowed for the conference and site visit.


Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to Neil M. Kern at KernNM@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. 


In accordance with 22 U.S.C.  4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the best technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to attach Specification Section 23 82 00, Convection Heating and Cooling Units, and respond to questions submitted for Solicitation VA256-09-RA-0258, Replacement of Fan Coil Units at Overton Brooks VA Medical Center.a. Responses to questions submitted for subject solicitation are attached as pages 3 through 15 of the amendment.    b. Date and time for receipt of offers (August 5, 2009 at 2:00 P.M. Local Time) remains unchanged. Question for VA-256-09-RA-0258Replace Fan Coil Units, 9th Floor, 8 North, 4 West & 2 NorthQUESTION 1:  Should a statement to read "Hot water coil to be in reheat position for dehumidification controlled FCU's "be added?   RESPONSE:  This is what the "coil setup" is referring to in the "Dehumidification" paragraph.  Yes, this statement is true, for the fcu's that are listed to be for dehumidification, the hot water coil shall be in the reheat position.QUESTION 2:  Are individual isolation valves currently installed on chilled water and hot water lines?  If not will the VA drain the system each day to allow for replacement of the 2 fcu's?  RESPONSE:  There is isolation valves on the majority of the branch lines supplying the fcu's that can be shut off in order to replace the fcu, valve sets, etc.  For equal bid, assume 90% of the branch lines have isolation valves.  Otherwise, the VAMC will do what we can to assist in coordinating a shutting down so that the contractor can install valves on these lines.  Contractor shall be responsible for providing and installing the 10% of valves that will be needed as well as the fcu isolation valves.  Any shutdowns along with all of the work will have to be coordinated and a phased work plan in place prior to any work.QUESTION 3:  If existing ball valves are to be replaced, this would result in a complete shut down and draining of the water systems each day for each wing.  Is the intent of this statement to actually replace the ball valves which isolate the fan coil units from the main supply lines?  Do all fan coil units have 4 ball valves to be replaced?  If not which ones do.  RESPONSE:  Refer to question 2.QUESTION 4, PART I:  Are new ball valves required where the do not exist?  RESPONSE:   Yes QUESTION 4, PART II:  If areas are inaccessible will new valves be required?   RESPONSE:Yes, unless during construction it is agree upon with the COTR and KO that it is inaccessible.QUESTION 5:  Should the statement "Install an automatic control valve on each fcu piping system" read instead, Install an automatic flow control valve on each fcu piping system?  RESPONSE:  Yes, it calls for a two/three way control valve and an auto flow control/balancing valve.  QUESTION 6:  Should the modulating valves be on-off control valves?  RESPONSE:  The hot water valves shall be modulating three way valves and the chilled water shall be two way two position (on/off) valves.  Hot water 3 way valves shall be two wire modulated valve that accepts 2-10 VDC or 4-20Ma signal.  Three wire floating point control is not acceptable.  QUESTION 7:  Installing all blow down and control valves over the auxiliary drain pan will result in a very crowded space and will not be easily accessible.  Is an auxiliary drain pan required under hot water valve package?  RESPONSE:  YesQUESTION 8:  Are 3-way modulating control valves required on all units?  RESPONSE:  See question 6QUESTION 9:  Where are the NAE's to be located?  Where does the system tie into?  RESPONSE:  Install the 2N/4W NAE in either 2E97 or 4E97.  Install the 8N/9th NAE in either 8E97 or 9E97.  Exact location tbd in construction.QUESTION 10:  Should the following be added:  Thermostats shall be JC TEC series with N2 protocol and Network Engines shall be NAE4500 series?   RESPONSE:  Those are acceptable; contractor shall follow the SOW and Specification. QUESTION 11:  Are the existing 3 speed fan control switches to be reused?  RESPONSE:  No, thermostats/fan controls shall be replaced with new 3 speed per SOW.  QUESTION 12:  What is the intent of the statement that requires the insulation of valve packages inside the fan coil units with fiberglass jacketed insulation?  The space available for insulation is extremely limited and normal installation of chilled water valve packages is with minimal insulation but over the drain pan.  RESPONSE:  Using fiber glass insulation per the SOW for the piping is an error and shall not be used for that application.  Here is what the VA will allow for Piping:Chilled Water Pipe1.	Cellular glass <1.5"dia = 1.5"wall thickness2.	Polyisocyanurate <1.0"dia = .75"wall thickness (can only use polyiso up to 1.5"dia pipe max due to flame rating)3.	For chilled water, I will only allow flexible elastomeric cellular on piping inside the fcu due to limited space.  It shall be properly glued. <1.0"dia = .75"wall thicknessHot Water Pipe4.	Polyisocyanurate <1.0"dia = .75"wall thickness (can only use polyiso up to 1"dia pipe max due to flame rating)5.	Flexible elastomeric cellular for hot water fcu run outs and inside unit.  It shall be properly glued. <1.0"dia = .75"wall thickness**for other pipe diameters, see specification.QUESTION 13:  Which of the new fan coil units are increased in size?  Are we to check all units?  Verifying pipe sizes mean cutting insulation from existing piping and re-insulating to prevent condensation.  It will be very time consuming to check all 128 fan coil units.  We will need 2 days of engineering staff time to gain access to all rooms and verify these conditions.   RESPONSE:  The intent is for the contractor to assume that pipe sizes are ok for the new units.  However, prior to ordering or installing a unit, contractor shall site verify the pipe sizes are the correct size for the new units.  If they are not, advise the COTR so that the issue can be addressed.QUESTION 14:  On the 9th floor what type of material is to be used to fill/seal crevasses? RESPONSE:  Our shop used a wood trim to cover large gaps around the top and sealed it to ceiling with latex caulk.  However, if you have a larger space, you will want to seal with a fire caulk that hardens and cannot be dug out by a patient.  See existing for example.QUESTION 15:  A specific size hole is required for the s/s plates required on the 9th floor.  There are many to choose from.    RESPONSE:  Match existing sizes of plate holes in each unit for each room.  I did not measure, but they look like they are 3/16"to 1/4"diameter holes.  All of the existing ones in patient rooms are the same holes size.QUESTION 16: Is it the VA's intent for the contractor to coordinate with the using services to schedule work in rooms, shutdowns, etc.?  Normal protocol is to coordinate with Engineering or Contracting.    RESPONSE:  Contractor is required to coordinate all with the COTR and intent is for them to help coordinate with the user as well.  Ultimately, the COTR will be responsible for the user coordination, but it will be a group effort as we can get very busy at times.  We want good communication by all for the project to run smoothly with the occupants and patients.QUESTION 17:  General note 2:  Is the contractor to verify the accuracy of the plans?  Plans do not indicate thermostat locations, ceiling types, etc.  New units and thermostats will be placed in the same location as the existing units?  What exactly are we verifying?  RESPONSE:  It is the contractor's responsibility to view the site prior to bid, ordering and construction as described in SOW.  If the contractor notices any errors or discrepancies, it is their responsibility to notify the KO prior to bid.QUESTION 18:  General note 3:  Which of the areas will require work after normal hours?  RESPONSE:  For equal competitive bids, use the following for after hours work:1.	2N LAB= 13 fcu's that have to be done after 4:30 pm.2.	4W Radiology= 2 fcu's/rooms that definitely require work after 4:30pm and 5 Radiologist fcu's/rooms that require either work after 4:30pm or a blacked out dust partition with access in and out for Radioligist.3.	8N Medical Services= 2 fcu's/rooms require work after 4:30pm.4.	9th floor Mental Health= 6 fcu's/rooms on 9East require work after 4:30pm. 3 fcu's/rooms on the rest of the 9th floor require work after 4:30pm.**note: there may be some after hours work for corridor work such as running the elec conduit for controls, that may be required if patient travel is high.**note: specific rooms/fcu's can be provided at later date.QUESTION 19:  Water Coil Piping Connection detail:  Detail shows pipe hanger supports in unit for valve packages.  Is this correct?  RESPONSE:  They need to be supported.  The detail is the standard VA detail.QUESTION 20:  Are unions required on each side of the control valve?  RESPONSE:  YesQUESTION 21:  Is the required test port to be pressure & temperature?  RESPONSE:  Spec calls out: 2.17 PRESSURE/TEMPERATURE TEST PROVISIONS 	      	A  	Pete's Plug: 6 mm (1/4 inch) MPT by 75 mm (3 inches) long, brass                 		body and cap, with retained safety cap, nordel self closing valve cores,             		permanently installed in piping where shown, or in lieu of pressure gage 			test connections shown on the drawings.QUESTION 22:  Will a test port in the bypass line on the hot water coil be required?  RESPONSE:  Yes QUESTION 23:  A number of the units on the schedule have no performance data.  Will this be clarified?  RESPONSE:  Use similar fcu performance data of other specified units that have a close cfm to the unit that does not have performance data provided.QUESTION 24:  Concerning the fresh air supply requirements, who assumes responsibility if the existing fresh air supply system will not provide the required flow?   RESPONSE:  After notification, if this occurs, the VA will attempt to adjust existing system to proved the OA.QUESTION 25:  Spec. section 09 91 00, Painting:  Please specify which items are to be painted, only items that could be found to paint is a boiler plant and chiller plant.   RESPONSE:  Many of the specifications are general and have information in them that does not apply.

Heating:  Thermostat shall modulate the hot water control valve to maintain space heating setpoint, which is three (3) degrees lower than the cooling setpiont.   Dehumidification:  On a call for dehumidification from the dehumidistat, the cooling valve shall be enabled.  The hot water valve shall modulate until the space temperature setpoint is reached.  When space humidity setpoint is reached the cooling valve shall return to its normal position.QUESTION 47:  In statement of work in the Valves section page 38 it is stated that there be secondary drain pans.  We do not feel this is an application that will be viable for this scope of work if there is a drawing or intent for this please advise.   RESPONSE:  All units shall have auxiliary drain pans.  See added spec section 238200.  QUESTION 48:  Page 236 spec is for air handler and not Fan Coil units.  As we see it this does not apply to our scope of work.  Please advise   RESPONSE:  Unless it is referring to any part of a fan coil unit, then it does not apply.Additional Notes As specified at the pre-bid site visit:1.	Some rooms, occupant will have to have access in and out during construction.  However, for the most part, they will temporarily move to a different room for that day.  It is anticipated that it will take not more than 8 hours to replace and have the new fcu operational.2.	For bidding, assume 90% of the branch lines have isolation valves and contractor will have to install new for the other 10% and VA will assist in shutdown unless contractor can do a successful pipe freeze instead of shutdown.3.	Majority of afterhours work as specified in question 18 can start after 4:30pm.4.	Contractor shall repair wall to match existing around the fcu and thermostat if new units are smaller or wall is damaged in construction.  COTR will inspect overall product to make sure it is good workman ship.  If it is not feasible to match existing, second application can be a wall plate to match existing colors.5.	Please allow time in your schedule for the VA submittal approval process.  Government can take up to 4 weeks to review a submittal.  All equipment shall be submitted and approved prior to ordering.6.	Assume one or two conex storage containers to store all materials near the hospital.7.	The control valves shall be installed as part of the factory fabricated piping package for the fcu's to ship with the fcu's.  Prefer that the piping package is factory fabricated and installed.8.	Dust partitions shall be required in all rooms as discussed at pre-bid site visit.9.	FCU in 9E14 room requires thermostat in existing lockable box in cooridor with remote sensor to room.10.	Replace existing ceiling tile/grid if damaged in construction.11.	For controls, here is a little explanation of what we have existing:  NCM's on arcnet (communicate thru coax) on old system to NIE (network integration engine, fancy NAE) that converts info to new architecture.  All NAE's talk extended architecture 4.1.  All talk back tcp/ip Ethernet connection (blue cable).  Powerline carriers (communicate thru power lines) talk to NCM's. SECTION 23 82 00CONVECTION HEATING AND COOLING UNITSPART 1   GENERAL 1.1 DESCRIPTION 	Fan coil units1.2 RELATED WORKA.	not usedB.

The contract and this modification were awarded on a cost reimbursable basis as the uncertainties involved in performance do not permit costs to be estimated with the sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price method.

<DESC>This action has been awarded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. In compliance with this act, the Government posts this notice that a competitive award for $2,617,100.00 was made on a Multiple Award Construction Contract to Stronghold Engineering, Inc. as task order N68711-05-D-4012-0023.
Rationale for this type of action is as follows: This acquisition is to support the Navy mission and was awarded competitively on an existing Multiple Award Construction Contract for Dry Utilities. The requirements of this project fit within the scope of work on the Basic Contract.
Summary of Project Scope:
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, in part directs the Government to undertake infrastructure and energy projects, the following project is a result of that legislation. In an effort to reduce our carbon footprint, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest will be adding Solar Photovoltaic Power Systems (SPVPS) to roofs on several bases in the region. The following scope of work is to install SPVPS on 1 building, with two optional buildings, that are located at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey, California. Included in the project is the demolition and replacement of the roof(s) on the 1 building to insure their integrity, longevity, and suitability to have the SPVPS installed. The SPVPS should supply power to the building and feed energy back into the power grid if/when there is an excess of electricity produced.

<DESC>This serves as a Notice of Intent to purchase Cobol Mining upgrade licenses from Information Analysis Inc.  The Government intends to purchase Modernization Workbench Server V 2.1 upgrade licenses on a sole source basis as  a logical follow-on to a previous competition under FAR Subpart 12.6:  

Description	Qty	Amount
Modernization Workbench Server
V 2.1 for x 86 (50 Named Users),
With Enterprise View Express			1			$238,392

Application Analyzer License (Java Parser)		1			$11,619

Application Analyzer License
(PowerBuilder Parser)					1			$11,619

Total:  $261,630

The Federal Acquisition Regulation basis is cited in FAR Subpart 6.302-1(b)(1), (a)(2)(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition;

The General Services Administration Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) purchased a commercial, off-the-shelf business rule mining capability to be used for the modernization and enhancement of a legacy batch-type system called FSS-19.  The purchase was made as a setaside for small business under FAR Subpart 12.6.  The Relativity  Modernization Workbench tool was previously purchased with single licenses.  To consolidate all mission critical applications in the portfolio, an enterprise license subscription is required for FY09

The original award was conducted as a streamlined, open market acquisition pursuant to FAR 12.6 during 2005.  The Government has determined that a commercial off-the-shelf solution to this requirement is available, but not through GSA Schedule (or any other Governmentwide Contract vehicle (GWAC).  As a logical follow-on to the original purchase, the Government will award under FAR 12.1

The period of performance is 2 years with options through FY11.  

The Modernization Workbench, Application Analyzer (Java Parser) and Application Analyzer (PowerBuilder Parser) software is proprietary, and no other vendor is authorized to manufacture or resell the product.  The vendor is qualified on the basis that the software has been successfully used for the past year.

All interested parties should request additional information, communicate concerns, or direct any questions concerning this acquisition to Holly Carr 703 605 5588, email:  holly.carr@gsa.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, nor a solicitation for offers.  RE:  Note 22.

<DESC>The DVA has awarded contract VA248-P-1134 for the period of twelve (12) months under authority 6.302-5(b)(6), and IL 049-0708 dated June 19, 2007.DEPARTMENT OF 						MEMORANDUMVETERANS AFFAIRSDate:  May 7, 2009									From:	Contract Specialist (672/PBD)Subj:	JUSTIFICATION AND AUTHORIZATION FOR THE USE OF A SERVICE-DISABLED VETERAN OWNED BUSINESS IN THE ACQUISITION OF THE MOBILE MRI UNIT AND TRAILER LEASING.To:	File1. AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: Department of Veterans Affairs, Procurement Business Division, Tres Ros Building, San Patricio, 27 Ave. J. Gonzlez Guisti, Suite 600, Guaynabo, PR, 00968. 	2. DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  This is a sole source contract action which comprises the leasing of a MRI Mobile Unit and trailer for Radiology Services at the VA Caribbean Healthcare System (VACHS), San Juan, Puerto Rico.3.  DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: The Department of Veterans Affairs-VA Caribbean Healthcare System intends to lease radiology equipment to substitute previous leased equipment that was damaged by fire back on December 3, 2008.  This leasing is done in the best interest of the Government to alleviate Fee Basis charges which has been an additional burden to the budget of the Hospital at this moment. Estimated value for a year period (twelve months) is $526,800.00.4.  AUTHORITY CITED: FAR 6.302-5 (b) (6). Authorizes sole source awards under the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 and IL 049-0708 dated June 19, 2007.	5.  REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED:  Services on this leased equipment for Radiology Services are available from five (5) SDVOSB sources and various other Large Businesses, whereas some reflected geographical limitations and fairly new to the market.  One of the large businesses is the DMS contractor  contract we currently have on hold pending determination of a possible Termination for the Governments convenience or Termination for cause due to fire occurrence mentioned in paragraph 3.  It is more advantageous to the Government that this contractor provides the leasing services to VACHS for the following reasons:          a) This company submitted past performance information of having provided same services for other VA facilities, and other similar radiology equipment.  This information was confirmed by each point of contact and performance quality is considered above satisfactory as per Past Performance Evaluation Questionnaires.  Some of the critiques were: proactive, reliable, willing to contract again in the future, knowledgeable, etc.  Past performance on this Contractor (SDVOB) reflects to be a good/excellent one.         b) Salvadorini Consulting LLC is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business (SDVOB) which is our number 1 priority socioeconomic goal to accomplish.        c) Request for proposal submitted to Salvadorini Consulting is advantageous in terms of price in comparison with quotation provided by Biomedical Engineer where Salvadorini Consulting LLC offers a $110,200 cost savings to the Government and monthly charges will become effective upon equipment being accepted by VACHS 	technical representative as fully operational and ready for use, while other quotation is immediately upon delivery date.  Also complies with VA Engineers requirements, 	as submitted and requested by Eng. Diana Dvila, Biomedical Engineer.         d) Salvadorini Consulting LLC has all required certifications to be in compliance with FAR AND VAAR regulations.6.  EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: None. See paragraph 5.7.  FAIR AND REASONABLE PRICE DETERMINATION:  Estimated for a year period (12 months) is $526,800.00. Estimated cost is based on current market price and considered more than fair and reasonable in comparison with former contract awarded in September 2008 for same services.8.  MARKET RESEARCH: A market survey was conducted for this action.  Documentation is enclosed in the contract file as required, for any further reference. 9.	OTHER FACTORS: None10.	INTERESTED SOURCES:                                    1)  SALVADORINI CONSULTING LLC (SDVOB)			111 Linden Lane			Lexington, NC 27292    			Telephone: 888-674-6683			DMS Imaging, Inc (LARGE BUSINESS)			11600 96th Avenue North			Maple Grove, MN 55369			Telephone: 763-315-1947			11.
