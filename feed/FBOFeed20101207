<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is soliciting proposals on a full and open competitive basis for a contract to migrate, operate, maintain and enhance the AHRQ Health Care Innovations Exchange (HCIE) resource, http://www.innovations.ahrq.gov/.
<p>The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will only be available by downloading from the Internet through www.fedbizopps.gov or through the AHRQ website at www.ahrq.hhs.gov. Interested Offerors are responsible for monitoring these sites for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available for downloading on or about 15 days after publication of this synopsis.</p>
<p>The HCIE is an Internet-based repository for the collection, classification, distribution of and dialogue around health care service delivery innovations and related information and tools. The HCIE is a searchable database of innovative strategies and tools used to improve health care quality and reduce health care disparities. Learning and networking opportunities are offered to promote dialogue and exchange of information about innovation, adoption, spread and specific innovations and tools.</p>
<p>The goal of the HCIE was, and continues, to be a publicly-accessible, national repository of health care service delivery innovations and tools and associated information needed to facilitate strategic decision making and to promote change and further innovation in the health care system for the purpose of improving health care quality and reducing health care disparities for all Americans. With this solicitation, the Health Care Innovations Exchange will also become a national repository of policy/public health innovations used to improve quality and reduce disparities. The Health Care Innovations Exchange will be the only national resource that will, when possible, draw relationships between policy/public health innovations and service delivery innovations.</p>
<p>There are five major tasks for this solicitation, each having specific requirements and deliverables:</p>
<p>Task 1 Content - establish and maintain an editorial board and expert panel; hold expert panel meetings; establish and apply AHRQ-approved inclusion criteria; establish a system to obtain, publish, update, archive innovations, tools and associated content; establish and maintain a validated system to index and abstract innovations and tools.</p>
<p>Task 2 Enhancements - propose recommendations for change; address AHRQ proposed changes; adhere to a change/configuration management plan.</p>
<p>Task 3 IT - design, develop, test, deploy, maintain and operate the Innovations Exchange Technical Infrastructure and Web Site; startup/transition requirements; technical requirements; database requirements; Web site Requirements; hardware requirements; hardware and software procurement; configuration and change management requirements; reporting requirements; documentation requirements; security and privacy requirements; technical assistance to HCIE users.</p>
<p>Task 4 - Learning and Networking - propose a multi-faceted approach for learning and networking opportunities to accommodate different learning styles; communicate venues geared toward adult learners; drive users to the HCIE; ensure interactions and learning amongst the user base including smaller networks and the broader HCIE user. Continue operation and maintenance of established HCIE social networking accounts and establish new social media in Web 2.0.</p>
<p>Task 5 - Project Management - provide general management; assist AHRQ with the Customer Satisfaction Survey; schedule, prepare and plan meetings; use project management industry best practices and Earned Value Management System; systems documentation; monthly progress reports; annual work plans; annual reports; final report; close-out/transition plan; work with other Agency contractors; Agency stakeholders.</p>
<p><br />While there are information technology (IT) components in this project, this is not an IT requirement. The project will be content driven supported by information technology.</p>
<p>The objectives of this solicitation are to:<br />&bull; Continue the efficient, systematic collection, and high quality classification and representation of innovations and tools; continue to emphasize innovations targeting public health priority diseases/conditions, priority populations, and efforts to reduce disparities in quality; continue to maintain relationships with other databases (such as AHRQ's National Guideline Clearinghouse and National Quality Measures Clearinghouse)<br />&bull; Expand the database and resource to include policy/public health type innovations aimed at improving health care quality or reducing disparities in care; show parent-child relationships between policy innovations (parent) and clinical processes or community services innovations (child)<br />&bull; Operate and maintain, and develop, test, and deploy a back end and front end and related changes that reflect attention to the systems development life cycle, complies with relevant government IT regulations and requirements (such as privacy and security), and earns value for the government<br />&bull; Establish a project expert panel that will provide feedback and guidance, and to establish an editorial board with capacity to review submissions and write expert commentary critiquing innovation successes and failures, offering insights and addressing the nuances of innovation, implementation, and change<br />&bull; Continually improve the design of the Innovations Exchange incorporating feedback from user testing, expert panel, editorial board and others <br />&bull; Provide appropriate and timely technical assistance to users<br />&bull; Provide dynamic opportunities for learning and networking among the users of the Web site</p>
<p><br />Approaches proposed by the Offeror to achieve the above objectives shall be based on a justified rationale, and the Offeror shall demonstrate an understanding of novel health care policy, especially aimed at improving health care quality and/or reducing disparities; health service delivery creativity, innovation and change; health care quality improvement or disparities reduction implementation and evaluation and associated tools; editorial processes and controls; medical content indexing; complex database development; government Web site design, prototyping, testing, and deployment; and adult learning and networking.</p>
<p>Offerors shall describe previous successes working with expert panels and editorial board and with managing conflicts of interest. In addition, Offerors shall demonstrate technical capability in applying the existing innovations and tools inclusion criteria by citing a sample innovation and tool not currently represented in the Innovations Exchange and offering a judgment with rationale as to the samples' candidacy for inclusion. Also, Offerors will pick three (of six) challenges currently faced by the Innovations Exchange and specify how they will tackle those challenges.</p>
<p>The Project Team shall consist of a PMI-certified Project Manager, Project Director, and other key staff, which can include subcontractors and/or consultants. Team members will have experiences in health services research; health care policy; clinical service delivery; community and social services relative to health care; health care quality improvement and/or disparities reduction; innovation and change management. Team members will be skilled at qualitative research; content capture, such as but not limited to investigative journalism; indexing and tagging using UMLS and other vocabularies; and systematic editorial processes and controls. In addition, some team members will have experiences in the IT life cycle and will be skilled at government database design/administration, government Web site design/deployment/maintenance, and obtaining system security certification and accreditation with an approval to operate in a short period of time.</p>
<p><br />AHRQ anticipates awarding one cost plus award fee contract under this solicitation for a period of one base year and four, one-year option periods.

<CONTACT>Kjulonda L. Ogles, Contract Specialist, Phone 4057395405, Email kjulonda.ogles@tinker.af.mil - Charlie Kimball
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />Hydraulic System Auxiliary Pump (Left and Right) Upgrade to KC-135R/T/OC-B (419 aircraft in total).
<p>PURPOSE<br />The C/KC-135 Aircraft Sustainment Branch Contracting Office (GKC/PK), Tinker AFB OK, is conducting market research to determine estimated cost of developing and installing a 3 and/or 10.0 GPM Hydraulic System Auxiliary Pump Upgrade(Left and Right) to meet all of the requirements in Table 1. This solution shall address meeting requirements in Table 1 and should not be limited to replacement of both the left and right pumps. The optimal solution would provide an independent onboard method of supplying hydraulic fluid with appropriate pressure and capacity to both the left and right hydraulic systems during ground operations. The hydraulic pump solution should be capable of accepting DC power for the purpose of charging the brake system for aircraft movement.<br /><br />DESCRIPTION<br />The KC-135 R/T/OC-B hydraulic system consists of four engine driven hydraulic pumps (NSN 4320-01-242-5153HS/PN PV3-205-39), one on each engine, that provide 3000 PSI to two separate hydraulic systems at 22.5 gallons per minute (GPM) flow. In addition, there are two auxiliary pumps (NSN 3010-00-5675873RK/PN DO81 (DC Motor), 4320-00-864-8677HS/PN PF24-3906-24ZH4 [Right Pump], NSN 4320-00-768-6345HS/PN 65W01020 [Left Pump]) both rated at 0.76 GPM flow. However, the 0.76 GPM flow from the current auxiliary pumps does not allow sufficient flow to support timely testing of all hydraulic systems. To facilitate ground testing, maintainers are required to run engines/or use the MJ-2A hydraulic test stand and the A/M 32A-86 electric cart. Requiring maintainers to run engines and/or test equipment is time consuming and costly to the Government. Providing an independent onboard method of supplying hydraulic fluid with appropriate pressure and capacity to both the left and right hydraulic systems will require a 3 and/or 10.0GPM pump, and would alleviate the use of hydraulic test stand which would result in a manpower savings, avoid engine runs for pre-flight checks that would resulting in fuel savings, and increase aircraft availability to support the warfighter.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking a Government off the shelf or commercial off the shelf solution that provides capability to sustain continuous operation of hydraulic systems on the aircraft without use of engines and hydraulic carts. If these requirements cannot be met, please provide the systems that cannot be supported by the proposed solution.</p>
<p>RESPONSE<br />Responses shall address:</p>
<p>1. Developmental schedule (duration from contract award to on aircraft testing completion)<br />2. Install Schedule using three different contract field team lines<br />3. Estimated developmental cost (including nonrecurring engineering and technical data)<br />4. A Kit and B Kit Cost break out <br />5. Estimated installation cost with installation hours (broken down by system)<br />6. The components/methods proposed to be replaced or modified<br />7. The expected reliability maintainability &amp; availability (RMA) improvement of replacement components<br />8. Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)<br />9. Description and rational of proposed system capabilities and operation<br />10. Details of proposed replacement components/methods to include, but not limited to, items such as electrical, hydraulic power system requirements, airworthiness certifications actions completed, current usage on other systems or in development, logistics support requirements/availability (parts supply, spares, repair, support equipment, tech data, training, pro and cons etc.)<br />11. Component lead times (longest lead time only for each system is required)<br />12. Maximum aircraft modified per year<br />13. One option for a 3 GPM pump and/or a second option for a 10 GPM pump.</p>

<RESPDATE>122210
<CONTACT>Ronnell Booker, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882051, Email rbooker1@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control Health (NCIPC), Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention, intends to award a sole source contract to the National Council on Aging, 1901 L Street, 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20036 for the purchase of consulting services and related products. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 813319, Other Social Advocacy Organizations. The period of performance for this procurement is 12 months. <br /><br />The National Council on Aging (NCOA) has the trust and cooperation of the members of the National Falls Free Coalition (NFFC), which will allow them to work cooperatively and to quickly identify, adopt and evaluate policy strategies. NCOA organized, built and has led the NFFC since 2004, and maintains the records of conference calls, contacts and committee activities. NCOA was instrumental in creating a number of National Advisory Working Groups composed of select NFFC members. Through the work of these Working Groups, NCOA can document the remarkable progress in infrastructure development that has occurred at the state and community levels. By actively promoting collaboration among its members and networks, NCOA has demonstrated a unique ability to reach deep into communities across the country, to promote partnerships, and to stimulate and implement evidence-based fall prevention initiatives. No other organization can demonstrate this relevant range of activities and accomplishments.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The National Safety Council, Safe States Alliance and Fall Prevention Center for Excellence were the other three organizations considered to define policy change strategies for falls prevention and to promote implementation of these strategies by members of the National Falls Free Coalition, guided by the approaches as outlined in the National Falls Action Plan. These three organizations have the experience to help define policy change strategies as they relate to falls prevention. However, they lack strong established partnerships and relationships with the National Falls Free<sup>TM</sup> Coalition (NFFC). The NFFC was organized by NCOA to provide an ongoing structure for leading organizations to move forward on one or more of the National Action Plan strategies that resonated with their organizational missions. In five years, the NFFC has grown to include 70 national and international member organizations. In 2006, the NFFC expanded to include six state falls coalitions that were organized to address this growing public health issue at the state level.</p>
<p>NCOA has established regular and ongoing communications with the state falls coalitions via conference calls, newsletters, workgroups, and periodic progress evaluations. None of the other organizations have this established relationship; they would need to spend considerable time and resources to create a similar working relationship in order to promote adoption of policy change strategies by the state coalitions.</p>
<p>NCOA is the only organization that can develop policy statements as needed, have them adopted through the NFFC and document the progress of implementation. <br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the National Council on Aging. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Ronnell Booker via email ONLY at eqf2@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2010-Q-13108 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN December 22, 2010. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The Library of Congress intends to issue solicitation LCFDL11R7500 for the FEDLINK Books and Library Publications Acquisitions Program. This Request for Proposals (RFP) is for services from vendors who can supply books and library publications (non serial publications) and associated acquisition support services to federal libraries, information centers, and other federal offices worldwide. The services of serials subscription agents and the acquisition of commercial online electronic resources are covered under separate LC/FEDLINK contracts and are not the subject of this solicitation. The RFP is divided into four lots which define four different but related aspects of books and library publications acquisitions: LOT 1 Firm Order Services; LOT 2 Approval Plan Services; LOT 3 Leasing Plan Service; and LOT 4 Technical and/or Order Processing Services. LOT 1 is the core of this solicitation - VENDORS MUST QUALIFY UNDER LOT 1 IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES UNDER OTHER LOTS. LOT 1 Firm Order Services covers firm orders; a one time order for a specific title (or specific titles) and number of copies, in contrast to a subscription or standing order. Under LOT 2, Approval Plans, a vendor automatically supplies materials potentially required by a library as they are published, based on a detailed profile of the library's collection needs. The library may return any publications deemed unsuitable for addition to the collection and is only billed for items retained. Under LOT 3, Leasing Plan Services, the customer leases publications from the supplier instead of buying them and retains an option to purchase leased items at a reduced price when the term of the lease is over. Under LOT 4 Technical and/or Order Processing Services, the vendor may provide technical processing for materials supplied under this solicitation, performing physical processing or cataloging in order to supply materials to the customer in shelf ready condition. The vendor may provide a computer based order processing system for the customer to make the acquisitions control process more efficient. Multiple awards are anticipated. The RFP #LCFDL11R7500 will be posted on or about December 15, 2010. The anticipated closing date for RFP #LCFDL11R7500 will be on or about January 20, 2011. Vendors are responsible for ensuring that all amendments to the solicitation are received and addressed prior to proposal submission. All proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the instruction provided in Section L of the RFP. Vendors who responded to and were awarded a Basic Ordering Agreement under LCFDL10R7500 (current BOA holders) need not respond to this solicitation. All questions shall be submitted in writing and addressed to the Contracting Officer via email as specified. All questions concerning the requirements of RFP shall be submitted prior to COB January 10, 2011. NO TELEPHONE CALLS will be accepted.

<DESC>Project Location: Region 1, East Side Acquisition Zone; Beaverhead-Deerlodge, Custer, and Gallatin National Forests.
<p>The Forest Service is in need of tree planting services to restore and reforest lands that may have been burned over after wildfires or after timber harvest. The purpose of this acquisition is to secure tree planting services that will ensure tree survival and growth. Tree survival and growth is dependent on the initial health of the tree seedlings, the manner in which trees are handled and planted, environmental conditions such as soil moisture and weather, and animal damage to the seedlings. The services secured from this contract will include appropriate tree handling and planting techniques during periods of the year when environmental conditions are most favorable to ensure tree survival.</p>
<p>This is a notice to interested contractors that the Forest Service intends to solicit for tree planting services on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge (B-DNF), Custer (CNF), and Gallatin (GNF) National Forest lands, and an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract/s with a base plus one option year will result. The successful Contractor/s shall furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, supplies (except those supplies designated as Government furnished items), and incidentals to perform all work necessary on the areas specified in each Task Order. The contract/s will include tree preparation, handling, planting, shading, and tree transportation to provide the seedlings with the greatest chance of survival. All aspects of the work program shall be performed in an organized, systematic manner to assure services shall be performed over the entire unit.</p>
<p>Snags and burned trees may be present in the planting units, creating a potentially hazardous condition and possibly resulting in blow-down and/or falling debris. Such activity may increase with windy weather conditions.</p>
<p>Specific locations, maps and unit data pertaining to planting units for individual sub-items will be provided with each Task Order. Spring and summer (if planned) tree planting seasons vary per geographic location, but performance periods may begin as early as mid-March and extend through July if planting is required in higher elevation areas. Planting stock may include bareroot 2-0, 1-0, and 1-1's and container plugs of 160's, 160L's, 91's, and 112's. Other stock may be used and will be specified on the Task Order and Detailed Information Chart. Species planted may include ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, Englemann spruce, lodgepole pine, western larch, and possibly a minor amount of white bark pine. The number of acres to be planted per year for each Forest unit will likely vary.</p>
<p>Interested parties may contact Alane Fitzpatrick at the Helena National Forest, Supervisor's Office (406) 495-3726. The solicitation will be available on approximately 1 February 2011, and can be downloaded from this website at that time.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a requirement to generate and characterize replicated and non-replicated deficient research grade, as well as, pre-GMP adenoviral Vector Seed Stocks (VSS) containing VRC inserts for expressing antigens derived from Human Immunodeficiency (HIV), Simian Immunodeficiency (SIV), Influenza and filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg). Technology gained under this contract will be used by the NIAID to manufacture vaccines to be used in human clinical trials, regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. GenVec, Inc. of Gaithersburg, MD has been identified as the only responsible sole source for this procurement. GenVec is the source of a proprietary packaging cell line (293-ORF6) that has a demonstrated safety profile in the production of adenoviral vectors for use in human clinical trials. In addition, product produced by GenVec has been used in previous clinical trials, and is scheduled to be used in an upcoming Phase II trial. Regulatory requirements indicate that the material for later phase clinical trials must be produced in the same cell line as that used for the initial studies, or the trials will likely need to be repeated at a substantial cost to the government. Switching to a different packaging cell line or manufacturing technology would require a repeat of a substantial number of previously conducted pre-clinical and clinical studies at a significant and unnecessary duplicative cost to the government. It is anticipated that any award issued from this solicitation will be in the form of a combined firm-fixed price and cost reimbursement IDIQ type contract. Requests for information or questions concerning this requirement must be submitted in writing, by email to LaDonna Stewart at lstewart@niaid.nih.gov by January 21, 2011. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Office of Acquisitions, Station Support Simplified Acquisitions Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis and issue a purchase order to University of TX Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78229-3900, to conduct the on-going Cross-Cultural Utility of Intermediate Measures (CIM) study. The CIM Study is a part of continuing project of the &lsquo;Treatment Units for Research on Neurocognition and Schizophrenia (TURNS) project that was competitively solicited and negotiated in 2003.<br /><br />This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.501 (a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541720 and the size standard is $7.0M. This acquisition is a firm-fixed-price; period of performance is to be fifteen (15) months from award date; and place of performance is in India.<br /><br />Schizophrenia is an illness characterized by cognitive deficits in the areas of attention, memory, and executive functions (Gold &amp; Harvey, 1993; Green, 1996; Velligan et al., 1997). These cognitive deficits have been found to be related to impairments in role functioning in individuals with schizophrenia and are considered a core feature of this disorder (Green, 1996; Velligan et al., 1997). Efforts to improve outcomes in schizophrenia have increasingly focused on ways to address cognitive impairments with the ultimate goal of improving functional outcomes (Velligan et al., 2008a; Velligan et al. 2008b; Velligan et al., 2006; Bell et al., 2008; Wexler et al., 2005).<br /><br />The Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) initiative was designed to encourage the development of cognitive enhancing pharmaceutical agents for schizophrenia by developing a process by which a medication could receive an indication for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia (Green et al., 2004; Nuechterlein et al., 2005; Buchanan et al., 2005; Nuechterlein et al., 2008; Kern et al., 2008). This initiative was collaboration among academicians, industry partners, and government agencies and resulted in recommendations for study design and the development of a consensus cognitive battery--the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB)-- to assess cognition in studies of novel compounds seeking this indication (MCCB Nuechterlein et al., 2008; Kern et al., 2008).<br /><br />As part of the MATRICS initiative, the Validation of Intermediate Measures (VIM) study was developed to assess the reliability, validity and utility of a number of intermediate measures that have faced validity for assessing functional outcome in schizophrenia. Because longer-term functional outcomes such as employment, or changes in marital status are not likely to be improved during the course of a typical clinical trial, the study focused on intermediate measures of functional capacity or everyday functioning that are thought be more amenable to change over this time period (Green et al., 2008). The goal of the VIM study was to select the measure or measures with the best psychometric properties for use in clinical trials of compounds designed to improve cognition in schizophrenia (Green 2009). Results supported the use of the UCSD Performance-based assessment (UPSA), the UPSA Brief and the Brief Version of the Test of Adaptive Behavior in Schizophrenia (TABS) for use as co-primary measures in clinical trials investigating medications for improving cognition.<br /><br />Concurrently with the VIM study, NIMH researchers conducted the Cross-Cultural utility of Intermediate Measures (CIM) study to investigate the cross-cultural applicability of these measures for use in international trials. The CIM study provided ratings of the cross-cultural adaptability of the VIM measures at 31 international sites in 8 countries. English-speaking PIs and frontline research staff familiar with conducting clinical medication trials were asked to make judgments on the Cultural Adaptation Rating Scale (C-CARS) regarding the extent to which each subscale of each intermediate measure could be applied to their culture and to subgroups within their culture based on gender, geographic region, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. This pilot identified problems for specific subscales on all the performance-based assessments across some of the countries. India, China and Mexico presented the greatest challenges in adaptation.<br /><br />Results of the CIM study suggested two potential ways to move forward for the development of a co-primary measure for use in international trials. The first option is to customize the best measure (UPSA Brief) for use in each country where the trial will take place. A second approach is to create a novel assessment tool with good psychometric properties that has been judged by expert clinical investigators as culturally appropriate. The CIM II study will investigate these approaches. The present study will examine a new measure the Functional Assessment Battery (FAB) composed of these 3 subscales; 2 from the UPSA and 1 from the TABS in a sample of patients at clinical sites in India. India was chosen as it was identified by raters as the most challenging country for adaptation.<br /><br />The following specific aims will be addressed.</p>
<p>Aim 1: To examine psychometrics of the FAB and the UPSA brief (version studied in VIM), including: 1) Reliability (test-retest reliability and inter rater reliability), and 2) Repeatability (utility as a repeated measure within the time frame of a clinical trial; absence of practice effects that yield ceiling effects).</p>
<p>Aim 2: To examine validity of the intermediate measures, including: 1) Correlation with measures that assess real-life functioning and 2) Correlation with cognitive performance:<br /><br />Study Design</p>
<p>This study will be conducted only in India. A total of 130 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia who meets eligibility criteria will be assessed at baseline and again at four weeks. To obtain this number of subjects, each of the 5-7 participating sites will recruit between 18-28 participants total. Sites will be identified as those experienced in clinical trials for schizophrenia. All measures proposed to be translated into Hindi.<br /><br />Assessments<br /><br />Assessments will be administered at study entry and one month later. Interview measures will be completed first, followed by the functional capacity measures (UPSA-B and FABS). The order of administration of the UPSA-B and FABS will be counterbalanced. The MCCB will be administered after the functional measures.<br /><br />The performance-based intermediate measures will be re-administered at the week 4 assessment to assess test-retest reliability and utility as repeated measures. Symptoms will also be re-assessed.<br /><br />Data Management</p>
<p>All data will be recorded on Clinical Report Form (CRFs) at the participating sites and faxed or emailed to the coordinating center at UTHSCSA for data entry and quality control. The statistical analysis will follow that of the VIM study. All data will be entered into relational databases meeting HIPAA requirements on an ongoing basis, using software that provides for double entry and numerous internal validity checks. Regular reports on data flow will identify any ongoing recruitment issues as they occur. Prior to statistical analyses, the data will be carefully inspected to alert us to such problems as unusual distributions, the desirability of transformations (e.g., logarithmic is often useful), missing data, outliers.<br /><br />Data Analysis</p>
<p>Test-retest reliability will be assessed by calculating ICC's for the FAB and UPSA-B, Utility as repeated measures will be examined by examining the proportion of scores for all functional capacity measures at floor/ceiling at baseline and week 4, mean change from baseline, and order effects. The validity of the functional capacity measures will be examined by calculating the correlation between each functional capacity measure and the measure of real world functioning and between each functional capacity measure and the MCCB summary score.<br /><br />As part of the MATRICS scientific board, Dr. Velligan at UTHSCSA has been involved in the planning of all phases of the prior studies. The NIMH is not aware of any other group that has the unique skills and experience to carry out this research program. The study requires an intimate understanding of the instruments; an ability to train raters who are working in a different culture; relationships with investigators in India; an understanding of processes for monitoring the quality of conduct of this international study. Dr. Velligan carried out the cross-cultural validation of intermediate measures study (CIM I) that raised important concerns about the use of these instruments cross-culturally. She has relationships with the staff in India sites that can recruit the needed numbers of participants to investigate the reliability and validity of the novel battery of intermediate measures of functional outcome that she helped to created as a result of that trial. Based on the expertise and prior experiences that Dr. Velligan acquired through her work on the subject studies, it has been determined that Dr. Velligan and/or the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio is the only qualified source to successfully perform the services. No other source will satisfy the agency's requirement.<br /><br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested party believes it can meet the above requirement may submit a statement of capabilities on or before 2:00 PM local time Thursday, December 16, 2010 to Liem T Nguyen, ln18x@nih.gov. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the government to determine if the party can perform the requirement.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in and have valid certifications in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) www.orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. <br />National Institute on Drug Abuse, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, on behalf of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a non-competitive basis to Acumen LLC of Burlingame, CA for continued support of the Medicare Research Information Center (MedRIC) linked research data capacities. MedRIC is a research tool that facilitates the acquisition and linkage of CMS data to surveys and registries sponsored by federal agencies.
<p>The tasks primarily include: continual acquisition of new Medicare data as it becomes available, updating the linkage of these data to those surveys designated by NIA, distribution of linked research files to approved users, and further enhancement of the breadth and depth of the data products available to researchers. Specific tasks include the following: <br />Task 1: Data Linkage, Collection, and Dissemination<br />Acumen will both maintain its current proprietary data inventory input (which includes Health and Retirement Study (HRS), Panel Study on Income Dynamics (PSID), Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA) and HealthABC) and linkages and update this inventory as new Medicare data becomes available and are approved for linkage. Maintenance not only includes adding new years of CMS administrative data to surveys already affiliated with MedRIC, but also linkage of existing administrative data to new surveys and registries (as identified by NIA) recruited in the future to partner with MedRIC, as well as the addition of other Medicare files as they are approved by CMS for data linkage. <br />Task 2: Development of Research Files<br />MedRIC will continue development of research extracts and summaries of CMS administrative files at the person level tailored to satisfy the research needs of a wide range of users. The aim is to create summary formats that remove the burden of working with large and complicated Medicare files in multiple formats across multiple years. In constructing these research files, algorithms will be created to translate raw data scanned claims records into meaningful indicators of medical conditions and treatments. These files will be formulated to provide user friendly and easy access to statistics describing individual respondents' health status and usage of medical services. This formulation shall be developed and refined with the input of the survey developers and their research teams. Development shall also include creation of versions of research files designed to enhance information content while maintaining data confidentially through the masking of HIPAA-sensitive variables.<br />Task 3: Documentation<br />MedRIC shall maintain and further enhance data documentation for both the linked research extracts of the raw claims records and the research summary constructions of the Medicare data. This data documentation shall be directly built into the research extract files, making specific data elements both easily understood and retrievable by potential users. In addition to written material, documentation shall also be provided in accessible and easily searchable electronic formats (e.g., html, Excel and Access formats). In addition to data layouts that report a label and description for each data element, MedRIC shall, in collaboration with study directors, further creation of more detailed data documentation and tools for working with Medicare data, including value formats and value frequencies, advisories on specific data elements and general guidance on the usefulness of Medicare data for health services research. <br />Task 4: Distribution of Research Files<br />MedRIC will distribute linked research extracts to end users in compliance with existing CMS and survey data security policies, as described in section 5. The process of extracting the data may be specific to each distribution. Minimally, each data distribution shall include the following elements:<br />Confirmation of request specifications; <br />Validation of approval for distribution from survey managers and in accordance with CMS DUA procedures; <br />Verification of data extracts;<br />Encryption of data files when written to media; and <br />Secure shipment/transfer of data files to the end user.<br />Task 5: User Support<br />MedRIC shall provide technical assistance and other guidance to users during all phases of the data request process. Guidance includes assisting users with formulating their requests, directing users to resources regarding requests and Data Usage Agreements (DUA), and facilitating DUA acquisition and maintenance. MedRIC staff shall also provide technical support in decrypting and reading data and support for understanding documentation to users after the receipt of shipped data files. MedRIC may develop and maintain other tools for user support, which could include websites and discussion boards, to supplement documentation.<br />Task 6: Project Management<br />MedRIC shall track and maintain detailed records of all request specifications and shipments and deliveries. These records will be available on a real time basis, and MedRIC will be able to respond to a request for information from NIA within 2 business days. Minimally, MedRIC shall provide reports twice a year to NIA detailing the researchers (including institutional affiliation) who requested linked datasets, dates of requests, research files distributed, and timeframes of permitted use. <br />Further, MedRIC shall manage and coordinate regular communication with personnel from all affiliated surveys and registries. This communication will inform these personnel about the status of administrative data linkages, availability of data products, and details summarizing the distribution of files to users. <br />Finally, MedRIC will maintain whatever records and communication are required by CMS as part of its DUA procedures.<br />In January of 2007 CMS announced that it would no longer distribute file extracts for years prior to 1997. As the Research Data Distribution Center (RDDC) for CMS Medicare data, Acumen LLC was permitted to download 100% of all Medicare files from 1991-1996. Because this data is no longer distributed through CMS fair competition is unlikely. They have kept their DUA for these data current, and has added to their onsite database in service of analytical work done under contract with the federal government. Additionally, Acumen has NIA and other institutions with the survey data (ie, HRS, PSID, BLSA, etc.) and file structures, as well as the likely needs of the research community which will be requesting these extracts; there would be a significant delay with another source provider to develop the same familiarity and relationships with the survey data providers.<br />The period of performance for this contract is two (2) years with three (3) option years<br />The acquisition is being conducted using FAR Part 12 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, competition requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 511120   Special Scientific Journal Issue on Using Ecosystem Services in Environmental Decision-Making
NAICS: 511120
The US Environmental Protection Agency intends to issue an RFQ on or after December 20, 2010.  The purpose is development of a Special Scientific Journal Issue on Using Ecosystem Services in Environmental Decision-Making.  
Any small business that feels they have the expertise to fulfill the requirements should submit a statement of capability to Martina Gillis-Massey at gillis-massey.martina@epa.gov on or before December 14, 2010.  Please see the following Statement of Work:
Statement of Work:
Background:  
According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA 2005, p.v): "Ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. These include provisioning services such as food, water, timber, and fiber; regulating services that affect climate, floods, disease, wastes, and water quality; cultural services that provide recreational, aesthetic, and spiritual benefits; and supporting services such as soil formation, photosynthesis, and nutrient cycling."
Several more recent classification schemes define ecosystem services more specifically as ecological phenomena (Boyd and Banzhaf 2007; Fisher et al. 2008, 2009), distinct from the human benefits obtained from them. These services are, nonetheless, closely related to the constituents of well-being, including security (e.g., freedom from environmental disasters), the basic materials of a good life (e.g., food, shelter), health (e.g., clean air and water), good social relations, and freedom of choice and action (MEA 2005, p. vi).  
The goal of the EPA's Ecosystem Services Research Program (ESRP) is to transform the way decision-makers understand and respond to environmental issues by making clear how their policy and management choices affect the type, quality, quantity and sustainability of the goods and services ecosystems provide to sustain human well-being.  Five years have passed since the publication of the MEA, and three years since the creation of the ESRP, and EPA believes that the time is ripe for a special issue of a scientific journal to focus on some of the most important problems and potential solutions to the problem of translating the vision on the MEA into the practice of environmental management, especially as it relates to EPA's mission, statutes, programs, and policies.
Requirements:
Publish a special journal issue, on line and in hard copy, that focuses on problems and real integrative solutions related to translating the vision of the MEA into the practice of environmental management, especially as it relates to EPA's mission, statutes, programs, and policies (See example topic areas listed below).  All manuscripts included in the special journal issue must receive peer scientific review by at least two recognized experts in the subject area.  It must be readily available to, and understandable by, professional and lay environmental managers and the general public.  The special issue shall be published on-line and in hard copy no later than 18 months from the award date of the contract. Two interim progress reports will be required.  The first, no later than 6 months after award and the second and final interim progress report due no later than 12 months from the date of award.  Two corresponding payments of 33% each will be paid, upon Program Office approval of progress, with a final payment made upon delivery of the final product. 
The following statement shall be placed in a prominent location in the special journal issue: "Although the information in this document has been funded (wholly) or (in part) by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under contract number (insert number) to (insert journal name), it does not necessarily reflect the views of the Agency and no official endorsement should be inferred."
The quotes must provide information in support of the six (6) technical evaluation criteria that will be used to select the most responsive quote and competent offeror.   Topic areas:
The following topic areas are of particular interest (in all cases, the emphasis is on examples of actual applications of ecosystem services to decision-making at scales ranging from global to regional to personal):
1.   How is the concept of ecosystem services changing environmental decision-making beyond the classic risk paradigm?
2.   How are ecosystem services being applied to rulemaking and other large-scale top-down environmental decisions?
3.  How are ecosystem services being translated quantitatively into benefits (monetized or otherwise)?
4.  How are ecosystem services and their uncertainties being incorporated into markets and offset programs?
5.  How are trade-offs among ecosystem services being considered in decision making?
6.  What are the advantages and difficulties of stacking or bundling ecosystem services in markets, offset programs, policy decisions, and other environmental management applications?
7.  What are the challenges to quantifying ecosystem services (including quantification of uncertainty) in order to support environmental decisions?
8.   How is the concept of ecosystem services changing monitoring and performance standards related to environmental management?
9.	How do ecosystem services scale to hierarchies of environmental decision-making?
10. What are the threshold levels at which overuse of services or damage to the systems providing them result in a sharp drop-off of those benefits? 
Evaluation Criteria:  
The Government will make an award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered. For this Request for Quotation, all evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are significantly more important than cost or price. The evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance.  This procurement will be awarded on a best value basis per the evaluation criteria:

TECHNICAL QUOTE INSTRUCTIONS	1. Proposals shall include a list of descriptive titles and authors of manuscripts proposed for the special issue, a brief description of the relevance of each manuscript to one or more of the ten topic area(s), and a time-line of activities and interim progress reports, leading to the final publication.
2. The offeror must describe a sound strategy for informing a broad audience, including federal, state, and private land managers and the public, of the availability and accessibility to the special issue.
3.  The offeror shall describe the breadth of its subscriber base, including federal, state, private land managers and the general public.  The offeror shall include a discussion of its subscription costs and how such costs compare to industry averages, to determine its accessibility to the public and other parties and organizations. The offeror shall discuss its experience in publishing complex scientific issues so they are understandable by the general public.
4.  The reader base must, in addition to being broad (as described above), include at least 10,000 readers.  The offeror must provide an estimate of the reader base, including supporting data and information.
5. The offeror shall discuss its demonstrated knowledge of ecosystem services.  Previous ecosystem services publications, knowledge and experience of the editorial board, etc. may serve as evidence.
6. All manuscripts included in the special issue must receive scientific peer review by a minimum of 2 scientists who are experts in the area of the publications. The offeror must demonstrate knowledge in ecosystem expertise by proposing a review panel, by name and expertise, for the special issue.	EVALUATION CRITERIA CRITERIA	1. The offeror will be evaluated on its knowledge about the practical applications of ecosystem service concepts to environmental management decisions.  The government will also evaluate the relevance of manuscripts proposed for the special issue to one or more of the ten topic area(s), and the comprehensiveness of the time-line of activities and interim products, if any, leading to the final publication.
2. The offeror will be evaluated on the soundness of its proposed strategy for informing a broad audience, including federal, state, and private land managers and the public, of the availability and accessibility to the special issue.
3.  The offeror will be evaluated on (1) the breadth of its subscriber base, including federal, state, private land managers and the general public, (2) a comparison of its subscription costs to industry averages and (3) its experience in publishing complex scientific issues so they are understandable by the general public.
4.  The offeror will be evaluated on the size of its reader base.   At a minimum, the offeror's reader base must include at least 10,000 readers.  Offering a reader base of less than 10,000 will render the quote unacceptable.
5. The offeror will be evaluated on its demonstrated knowledge of ecosystem services.  
6. The offeror's propose review panel will be evaluated on its demonstrated knowledge in ecosystem expertise.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), Office of Human Research Ethics, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, for providing Institutional Review Board (IRB) Services for Human Research.  The services required are essential for research experiments involving human subjects.  The contractor shall serve as the designated IRB of record; provide review and oversight of EPA's human subject research; coordinate with and establish IRB authorization agreements; provide consultation to EPA staff; and provide training for EPA staff related to ethics and other topics relevant to conducting human research.  The period of performance is anticipated to be 12months from date of award with four 12-month optional periods of performance.  EPA believes that UNC-CH Office of Human Research Ethics is the only source capable of providing the specific review services.  UNC-CH has five IRBs, each with members who have specialized areas of technical expertise that align with NHEERL?s diverse human research program.  These IRBs have provided expert review and oversight to the Environmental Public Health Division (EPHD) for over two decades and as such are familiar with the large number and complexity of NHEERL?s often unique research studies.  Other unique qualifications of UNC-CH supporting EPA's beliefs are a preponderance of the human subjects research is conducted in collaboration with UNC-CH; the EPA EPHD is located on the campus of UNC-CH; and the research must be reviewed by UNC's IRB to comply with UNC policy.  Since the majority of human research protocols must be reviewed and monitored by a UNC CH IRB to ensure compliance with UNC  policy for on campus research involving UNC staff, the introduction of another IRB would disrupt critical time-sensitive on going research resulting in unacceptable delays.  The circumstance permitting "Other than Full and Open Competition" is FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".   All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services shall fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541690, which has a small business size standard of $7.0 million, is applicable.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be ho nored.  Submit response via US Mail to the U.S. EPA, Attn:  Marsha B. Johnson (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC  27711.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Synopsis: <BR>This project is 100% set-aside for Small Business concerns. The Government plans to award up to five (5) separate Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts resulting from this solicitation.<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for construction work using a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC). This Request for Proposal (RFP) will result in up to five (5) firm-fixed price ID/IQ contracts to the offerors that provide the best value to the Government. Task Orders under the potential contract may utilize American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding.<BR><BR>The purpose of this MATOC is to provide design-build and design-bid-build construction work and services for a broad range of military construction work for the Kansas City District, primarily at Whiteman Air Force Base.<BR>This acquisition will follow the 2-Phase selection procedure.  Phase 1 of this process will be open to all Small Businesses and will involve technical approach and qualifications.  Up to eight firms will be selected to proceed to Phase 2.  An amendment to the Phase 1 solicitation will be sent to the firms that are selected in Phase 1 asking for the submission of Phase 2 proposals.  Phase 2 will involve design and/or construction concepts, management approach, key personnel, and proposed technical solutions for Task Order 0001.<BR><BR>The total contract duration (consisting of a base period plus four (4) option periods) is sixty (60) consecutive months after the contract award. The duration of each contract period is not to exceed (NTE) 365 days. Any unused capacity in one contract period may be carried over into the subsequent contract period. The total acquisition amount is not to exceed (NTE) $49,000,000.00. Option Periods will be exercised at the Government's discretion. The Government will obligate to the contractor a guaranteed minimum amount of $10,000.00. The successful offeror will be required to furnish all labor, materials, permits, equipment and services necessary to manage and accomplish the designated deliveries, recommending a solution and remediation of any problems in a timely and efficient manner. <BR><BR>The task orders will range from $2,500.00 to $10,000,000.00 per task order and will be for construction projects of varying size and complexity. Task Orders will include multi-disciplinary activities, but not limited to construction, reconstruction, renovation, restoration, incidental or limited design associated with those types of projects, and other presently unforeseeable requirements that may arise, and will include a variety of trades that are required for military construction projects. The ID/IQ MATOC will not be used for Architectural-Engineering (AE) services; however, design services may be needed for some projects.<BR><BR>The North American Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is 236220 and the associated small business size standard is $33,500,000.00. <BR><BR>Task Order 0001: The successful offeror will be required to perform construction of the Munitions Loading Adapters  (MLA)  and Munitions Handling Units (MHU) Trailer Storage Facility, at Whiteman Air Force Base, upon award of the Base Contract.<BR><BR>Place of Performance for Task Order 0001: Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri<BR>At this time, no pre-solicitation conference is planned for Phase 1. If the Government does elect to hold a pre-solicitation conference, the pre-solicitation announcement will be modified accordingly.<BR><BR>The Phase 2 amendment will include a site visit to the site for Task Order 0001. Information regarding the site visit will be included with the amendment.<BR><BR>The Phase 1 solicitation will be available on or about January 5, 2011 and proposals will be due 30 days after the date of solicitation posting. The solicitation including any amendments shall establish the official opening and closing date and time.<BR><BR>This solicitation with plans, specifications, and any amendments, will be published in electronic format on FedBizOpps https://www.fbo.gov.

<SUBJECT>Hydralic System Auxiliary Pump (Left & Right) Upgrade 
<SOLNBR>FA8105-HydraulicPump
<RESPDATE>012011
<CONTACT>Kjulonda L. Ogles, Contract Specialist, Phone 4057395405, Email kjulonda.ogles@tinker.af.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />Hydraulic System Auxiliary Pump (Left and Right) Upgrade to KC-135R/T/OC-B (419 aircraft in total).
<p>PURPOSE<br />The C/KC-135 Aircraft Sustainment Branch Contracting Office (GKC/PK), Tinker AFB OK, is conducting market research to determine estimated cost of developing and installing a 3 and/or 10.0 GPM Hydraulic System Auxiliary Pump Upgrade(Left and Right) to meet all of the requirements in Table 1. This solution shall address meeting requirements in Table 1 and should not be limited to replacement of both the left and right pumps. The optimal solution would provide an independent onboard method of supplying hydraulic fluid with appropriate pressure and capacity to both the left and right hydraulic systems during ground operations. The hydraulic pump solution should be capable of accepting DC power for the purpose of charging the brake system for aircraft movement.<br /><br />DESCRIPTION<br />The KC-135 R/T/OC-B hydraulic system consists of four engine driven hydraulic pumps (NSN 4320-01-242-5153HS/PN PV3-205-39), one on each engine, that provide 3000 PSI to two separate hydraulic systems at 22.5 gallons per minute (GPM) flow. In addition, there are two auxiliary pumps (NSN 3010-00-5675873RK/PN DO81 (DC Motor), 4320-00-864-8677HS/PN PF24-3906-24ZH4 [Right Pump], NSN 4320-00-768-6345HS/PN 65W01020 [Left Pump]) both rated at 0.76 GPM flow. However, the 0.76 GPM flow from the current auxiliary pumps does not allow sufficient flow to support timely testing of all hydraulic systems. To facilitate ground testing, maintainers are required to run engines/or use the MJ-2A hydraulic test stand and the A/M 32A-86 electric cart. Requiring maintainers to run engines and/or test equipment is time consuming and costly to the Government. Providing an independent onboard method of supplying hydraulic fluid with appropriate pressure and capacity to both the left and right hydraulic systems will require a 3 and/or 10.0GPM pump, and would alleviate the use of hydraulic test stand which would result in a manpower savings, avoid engine runs for pre-flight checks that would resulting in fuel savings, and increase aircraft availability to support the warfighter.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking a Government off the shelf or commercial off the shelf solution that provides capability to sustain continuous operation of hydraulic systems on the aircraft without use of engines and hydraulic carts. If these requirements cannot be met, please provide the systems that cannot be supported by the proposed solution.</p>
<p>RESPONSE<br />Responses shall address:</p>
<p>1. Developmental schedule (duration from contract award to on aircraft testing completion)<br />2. Install Schedule using three different contract field team lines<br />3. Estimated developmental cost (including nonrecurring engineering and technical data)<br />4. A Kit and B Kit Cost break out <br />5. Estimated installation cost with installation hours (broken down by system)<br />6. The components/methods proposed to be replaced or modified<br />7. The expected reliability maintainability &amp; availability (RMA) improvement of replacement components<br />8. Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)<br />9. Description and rational of proposed system capabilities and operation<br />10. Details of proposed replacement components/methods to include, but not limited to, items such as electrical, hydraulic power system requirements, airworthiness certifications actions completed, current usage on other systems or in development, logistics support requirements/availability (parts supply, spares, repair, support equipment, tech data, training, pro and cons etc.)<br />11. Component lead times (longest lead time only for each system is required)<br />12. Maximum aircraft modified per year<br />13. One option for a 3 GPM pump and/or a second option for a 10 GPM pump.</p>

<DESC>The Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Product Manager Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-SCIE), Personnel Airdrop Team, Natick, MA is conducting a market survey to locate potential manufacturers or suppliers of a ADS-B/TCAS Transponder (AT) for use during Military Freefall (MFF) operations.  The AT will support MFF training and operations for Army Special Forces by transmitting an ADS-B signal to alert any aircraft in the area of the presence of a parachute jumper or jumpers.  With the information provided by the AT, an aircraft may alter their course according to TCAS instructions to avoid a collision between aircraft and jumper, in an effort to reduce risk of injury or fatality during MFF operations.<BR><BR> The ADS-B/TCAS Transponder shall -<BR><BR>1)	Transmit ADS-B/TCAS messages to in range aircraft during MFF operations (T=O).<BR><BR>MFF jumpers will be increasingly susceptible to collision paths with aircraft traffic at higher altitudes during High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) jumps.  With the increased standoff ability provided by the ARAPS parachute, it is possible for parachutists to travel upwards of 50 km from the initial drop point.  Parachutists have a small profile and cannot be detected by the radar and TCAS avoidance systems currently employed on commercial aircrafts.  To reduce the risk of parachutist injury or fatality, an ADS-B/TCAS compliant transponder is required to alert civilian and military aircraft of a parachutist's presence in the airspace so that a potential collision can be avoided.<BR><BR>2)	Provide ADS-B/TCAS operation from the time jumper exits aircraft to the time of landing.<BR><BR>The transponder must provide ADS-B/TCAS messages during the entire flight of the parachutist, from exiting the aircraft to the time of landing to ensure that aircraft at all altitudes are made aware of the jumper's presence.  This will necessitate the need for a dual band unit operating with both 1090ES and UAT technology for full coverage in CONUS.<BR><BR>3)	Have a display and user function controls on the display to include an on/off and brightness switch.  The brightness control shall allow for full visibility use during day or night operations (T=O).<BR><BR>The AT shall allow a jumper to manually turn the system on and off from the display unit.  Additionally, the user shall be able to manually control the brightness of the display from the display itself and adjust the system for use during day or night-time operations.<BR>4)	Provide access to basic control functions on the display unit to operate the AT (T=O).<BR><BR>The AT shall provide a means to control the device with a set of buttons.  Required functions include:  ability to set a "SQUAWK CODE," ability to switch the unit from an armed state to an active state.<BR><BR><BR>5)	Include a barometric altimeter to automatically activate the system upon leaving the aircraft (T=O).<BR><BR>The AT must remain in the armed state while the jumper is aboard the aircraft to prevent interference with the navigation of the plane.  Upon exiting the craft, the AT must automatically switch from the armed state to the active state and begin transmitting ADS-B/TCAS signals. <BR><BR>6)	Function at altitudes up to 24,999 ft, to minimum temperatures of -30 F, and maximum temperatures of 120 F (T); at altitudes up to and including 35,000 ft, minimum temperatures of -60 F, and maximum temperatures greater than 120 F (O).  <BR><BR>Current HAHO missions require navigation equipment to function at extreme altitudes up to 35,000 ft, and extreme temperatures as low as -60 F.<BR><BR>7)	Be powered by a replaceable battery power source that shall last 3 hours (T) to 6 hours (O) of continuous usage.<BR><BR>The AT must be self contained and run for a minimum of 3 hours of continuous use.<BR><BR>8)	Have a weight (including display, power source and all associated hardware) of no more than 5 lbs (T), 2.5 lbs (O).<BR><BR>The weight of a jumper during a HAHO mission is already substantial and includes the weight of the helmet, oxygen system, communication system, and during night operations- night vision devices, as well as other gear and weapons.  The AT system shall therefore be as light as possible to not overburden the soldier. <BR><BR>9)	Be compatible with current military free fall equipment solutions.  This includes the MICH/ACH/BUMP ACH helmets, currently approved night vision devices, MC-4, T-11, MC-6 and ARAPS parachutes and associated gear (T=O).<BR>  <BR>The AT shall be compatible with all current and future MFF gear.<BR><BR>10)	The unit shall be operable in a MFF environment and all stages of a MFF operation (T=O).<BR><BR>The AT will be operated in a MFF environment and must satisfy all Military Standards regulating mechanical shock, vibration, and temperature.  Additionally, the AT will be used in an EMI rich environment due.  This will include exposure to the Joint Precision Airdrop (JPADS) Self-Contained Kit, MBTR Radios, JPADS cargo bundles, jumper navigation computers and the aircraft electrical system.  The AT must also be able to operate effectively in the presence of multiple AT units.  This will be up to 24 units used in close proximity to one another.<BR><BR>All interested firms and manufacturers, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information.  Information submissions should include available technology, product literature and illustrations, and relevant company background/experience.  Available product pricing will also be provided as part of the information submission. <BR><BR>If a company does not possess a commercial product currently capable of satisfying these requirements but is interested in developing this technology the POC for this Sources Sought notice will accept a white paper detailing development plans to include schedule and funding requirements.  <BR><BR>Information submissions must be received by 31 January 2011.  Responses to this notice should be directed to: Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, Product Manager Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment, Personnel Airdrop Team,  ATTN: Brian Huffman, Natick, MA 01760-5057 or e-mail to Brian.G.Huffman@us.army.mil.  All information supplied will be considered confidential, unless otherwise specified by the firm or available from other sources without restriction.

<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives<br /></strong>The purpose of the NIAID Virology Quality Assurance (VQA) program is to provide a comprehensive quality assessment program for virologic assays for HIV, and HIV-related viral co-pathogens, performed on samples from subjects enrolled in NIAID-sponsored multi-site clinical studies. The VQA program ensures the validity and inter- and intra-laboratory comparability of virologic laboratory data obtained from NIAID-supported clinical trials and HIV natural history studies by providing laboratories with proficiency testing panels and real time assay run controls, and analyzing proficiency panel and assay run data from each laboratory. The VQA program also implements standards of performance for existing and state-of-the-art new virologic assays, develops and tests biostatistical methods relating to the assays, and acquires, tests, stores and dispenses quality control materials and reagents. Thus, the VQA program is critical to the scientific integrity of on-going and future studies concerning HIV diagnosis, disease progression, assessment of treatments, vaccine efficacy and other preventive measures. The VQA has been in operation since 1988 and has developed and standardized quality control procedures for approximately 25 virologic assays used in DAIDS-sponsored clinical trials. The current contract is entitled "DAIDS Virology Quality Assurance" and is with the Rush Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.</p>

The contractor must also plan and execute single and multi-laboratory studies for the evaluation and development of new and existing virologic assays and supporting statistical methodologies, implement standards of performance for existing and new virologic assays, develop and test biostatistical methods relating to the assays, and acquire, test, store and dispense all quality control materials and reagents required for this program, including specimens collected from HIV-infected and-uninfected human subjects.</p>
<p>The contractor will serve laboratories associated with current and future NIAID-sponsored clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups. Currently, the contract serves approximately 110 laboratories, with 55 international laboratories in 22 countries.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates a potential need to expand the number of laboratories serviced by the Program during the course of the contract and also anticipates a potential need for similar services that address viral disease agents other than HIV and related viral co-pathogens. Increases in effort for these services would be implemented through the exercise of contract options, at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance<br /></strong>It is anticipated that a level of effort type contact will be awarded. The period of performance will be for one year beginning approximately June 1, 2012 through May 31, 2013. The requirement will be the delivery of 9.10 full time equivalents (FTE) per year for the base period (Year 1) and 9.10 FTE per year for Options 1-6 (Years 2-7).</p>
<p>In addition, the Government may exercise options for an increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand for the activities supported by the base requirements of this contract. Options for increased services may include:</p>
<p>Increased Level of Effort for Additional Labs: During the course of the contract it may be necessary to incorporate additional Labs to support new NIAID-supported clinical trials. Such an increase would require an increase in the Contractor's activities to be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as an option. Each option of this type will implement work commensurate with the addition of 5 Labs. More than one (1), but not more than three (3), Options may be exercised in any one year. It is estimated that an additional 0.20 full time equivalents (FTEs) will be needed to accommodate these additional Labs during the first year of activation. If the options for these Labs are exercised for continuation in subsequent years, 0.10 FTE/year will be needed. Options to add new Labs will not be exercised in the last year of the contract (Year 7).</p>
<p>Addition of Expertise: Addition of a Quality Assessment Program for viral disease agents other than HIV and related co-pathogens. During the course of the contract it may be necessary to develop a quality assessment program for assays associated with viral disease agents other than HIV that were not anticipated at the time this solicitation was initiated, and that would directly support high priority NIAID research programs. During the contract period, one option could be activated for the addition of a Quality Assessment Program. The option may be activated in any year of the contract. Additional options to extend the Quality Assessment Program for subsequent years may be exercised as well. It is estimated that 3.10 full time equivalents (FTEs) will be needed for this Option in the first year, and in subsequent years if options are exercised for continuation.<br /><br /><strong>Capability Statement/Information Sought<br /></strong>Potential sources must demonstrate and document the following in their capability statements:</p>
<p>The program will require the ability to obtain quality control materials to be used in proficiency panels and assay run controls. This will require the ability to grow HIV in cell culture and will also require access to domestic and international populations of HIV-infected and -uninfected individuals for donation of blood and other clinical specimens to be processed for use as quality control materials in validation and proficiency panels and in panels used for the evaluation of new and existing virologic assays.</p>
<p>The contractor must have the ability to provide multiple domestic and international laboratories with validation and proficiency testing panels and reagents and controls, and must be able to retrieve and analyze data from all laboratories.</p>

<a href="mailto:george.knowlton@smdc-cs.army.mil">U.S. Army Strategic Command </a>
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) from the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT).  USASMDC/ARSTRAT is seeking information on firms that are interested and capable of providing alarm response services related to electronic security systems in the Colorado Springs, CO area.  The alarm response services would cover the facility located at 1670 N. Newport Road, Colorado Springs, CO 80916.  Alarm response services would potentially include the following:<BR>- The contractor would need to dispatch a guard response force if an alarm condition is triggered by the intrusion detection system (IDS) within 100th Missile Defense Brigade (MDB), 1670 N. Newport Road.  The contractor's guard response force would serve as a visible deterrent to the commission of crime, prevent damage to Government resources, and provide an immediate response element to alarms if triggered.  The SCIF on the first floor of 1670 N. Newport Road, Colorado Springs, CO resides within a four story commercial building.  The SCIF has an intrusion detection system (IDS) that detects ambient changes in temperature through the use of infrared detection (IR).  The tenants (100th MDB and 117th Space BN) affiliated with use of the SCIF reside on the first two floors of the building.  Only the SCIF however will need immediate attention when an alarm condition exists.<BR>- The contractor's guard response force personnel would have to have, at a minimum, a National Agency Check (NAC).<BR>- The contractor would need to provide continuous alarm response coverage 7 days per week, 365 days per year and provide alarm response services during non-business hours, 6:00 p.m. - 6:00 a.m. Monday through Friday and weekends and designated federal holidays.<BR>- Per DCID 6/9, an initial response force must arrive on site at 1670 N. Newport road within 15 minutes. However, the SCIF at 1670 N. Newport Road is allowed a 30 minute response time approved by the CSA. So the contractor's guard response force would have to arrive on site at 1670 N. Newport road within 30 minutes of alarm annunciation.<BR>- The contractor's guard response force would investigate the alarm and secure the scene until being properly relieved by an 100th MDB representative; however the contractor would not be required to remain on site exceeding 60 minutes after arrival.  <BR>The period of performance would be 01 February 2011 through 31 January 2016 (basic 1-year period plus 4 1-year option periods).<BR>Responses to this RFI should include the following:<BR>- Qualifications, capabilities, and previous experience as related to the services listed above.<BR>- Type labor classifications your firm would use to provide the alarm response services.<BR>- Company size status, to include an any small business/8A qualifications.<BR>- Provide Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) price estimates for alarm response services per year through 31 January 2015 including monthly rates and manhours per year.  List any discounts that may be provided for providing alarm response services for a 2nd facility located within a five mile radius of 1670 N. Newport Road, Colorado Springs, CO 80916.  <BR>- Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) price estimates to include type labor classifications and labor rates for alarm response services.<BR>All interested parties must submit their responses electronically via email to George.knowlton@smdc-cs.army.mil - responses will not be accepted at any other email address and no other form of submission will be accepted.  Responses must be received by no later than 4:00 PM (Mountain Time) on December 16, 2010 to be considered in response to this RFI.  Respondents should include contact information to include an email address and telephone number.  This is a Request for Information to identify sources interested and capable of providing the aforesaid commercial services.  This information is provided for a market survey for planning purposes only.  This RFI does not constitute a Request For Proposal or an obligation on the part of the Government, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach that may be chosen at a later date.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.  Proprietary information is not being solicited; however, if it is submitted, it should be appropriately marked.

The related functions of both machines is/are compression or tension load testing of various materials.  To date, there are only a handful of similar testing machines strategically located throughout the continental United States.  To the best of the Government's knowledge, federal agencies and universities have the majority of such units (Four units total throughout CONUS and OCONUS).   The required calibration services shall be performed in the Materials Engineering and Research Laboratory, Building 56, Denver Federal Center, Denver, CO  80225.  The calibration of these testing machines shall be executed in accordance with ASTM E 4 in compression on all ranges.

<DESC>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Office of Forensic Sciences intends to award a purchase order to American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors/Laboratory Accreditation Board (ASCLD/LAB), under the sole source authority of<BR>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  The purpose of this purchase order -- which will be issued under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures -- is to maintain the accreditation of DEA's forensic laboratories.    
DEA's forensic laboratory system achieved accreditation under ISO 17025 and ASCLD/LAB supplemental requirements through the ASCLD/LAB International Program in 2010.  Each accreditation remains in effect for five years with payment of an annual accreditation fee.  
A sole source purchase is appropriate because ASCLD/LAB is the original organization that inspected the DEA laboratories and granted the certificates and is the only entity that can validate each laboratory's ASCLD/LAB International Certificate of Accreditation and approve maintenance of these Certificates of Accreditation for each laboratory.   
If any another organization determines it has the capability to provide ISO 17025 and ASCLD/LAB supplemental requirements through the ASCLD/LAB International Program -- and is therefore a responsible source -- it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the DEA.  The closing date for such submissions is Friday, December 17, 2010, 3:00 p.m. EST

Contracts are Firm Fixed Price Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contracts for  architect-engineering (AE) services for planning, studies, plans and specifications, cost estimates, surveying, soil investigations, contamination surveys, interpretive design, construction management services, field inspections and reports, and interior design services.  This contract shall provide the continuing requirement for AE services while Region 7 procures new 5-yr  IDIQ contracts.  The period is extended from February 28, 2011, the current contract expiration date, to August 30, 2011.  The extended period is in part due to USFW conversion from its current financial and contracting systems to its new Financial Business Management System.   The conversion of the system imposes constraints on the agency which precludes award of new multiple year contracts prior to conversion to the new system in Fall of 2011.   Extension shall be made under the authority for other than full and open competition FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B) due to unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for statements of qualifications or proposals.

<DESC>Response Date: December 16, 2010
In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research  and Development  and EPA?s Office of Emergency Management (OEM),  intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order to Hanover Scientific Company to purchase an enclosure and stand for the Janus Workstation Robotics System.  The justification is as follows:   The Lawrence Livermore  National Laboratory (LLNL) developed a rapid PCR-based identification assay for Bacillus anthracis using the ABI 7500 PCR instrument and Janus Workstation Robotics system.  OEM plans to verify/validate the PCR assay as part of its effort to develop in house analytical capability for Bacillus anthracis.  In conjunction with the ABI 7500 PCR platform, the Janus Workstation Robotics will enable rapid processing of samples. In order to successfully conduct the validation exercise, it is necessary to use the same equipment as originally employed during the method development  phase to mitig ate variability associated with the equipment
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, which if received within ten (10) calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NO SOLICITAION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS SYNOPSIS</span></strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this Modification 47 is to obligate $570,303 in new funding for Option Period 3 in support of work assignments that will be carrying forward (WA 2-101; WA 2-102; and WA 2-103). The period of performance for the new work assignments (3-101; 3-102; and 3-103) is anticipated to be from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. These work assignments will be initially funded as follows: WA 3-101 will be $120,000; WA 3-102 will be $90,000; and WA 3-103 will be $360,303.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under WA 3-101, the contractor will continue to provide support for technical and administrative tasks to inform and coordinate Regional and Headquarters policy development and decision-making on meeting the BA provisions of ARRA particularly in regard to requests for waivers from the requirements of section 1605. Efforts include:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61553; Collect and log all requests for waivers from the requirements of the Buy American provisions of the ARRA. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61553; Evaluate waiver requests related to the purchase and installation of construction material and equipment for water and wastewater facilities to ensure waivers comply with applicable justifications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61553; Evaluate construction cost estimates and develop detailed independent construction cost estimates as needed to evaluate waiver requests for the purchase and installation of construction material and equipment for water and wastewater treatment facilities, including estimated costs for iron, steel, and the relevant manufactured goods. Compare project costs using goods manufactured in the US compared to foreign manufactured goods. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61553; Prepare a report on each waiver.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &#61553; Develop a tracking spreadsheet database documenting each waiver request.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under WA 3-102, the contractor will continue to provide the technical and logistical assistance to support the EPA in achieving the goal, objectives and requirements of the ARRA provisions as to "Green Infrastructure." Efforts will revolve around the review of DWSRF project proposals received by the individual State for ARRA funding to determine whether those projects have a green component, and make recommendations for green practices that can be incorporated into the projects. The effort will include providing technical assistance to states and applicants in developing and reviewing the "business cases" that are submitted along with projects in support of considering them as green projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary focus is on the green aspects of drinking water infrastructure projects. The work is intended to supplement and be coordinated with EPA's efforts for the GPR through the CWSRF.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This work assignment will benefit the agency by advancing our goal of encouraging the development and implementation of projects that provide the social, health and environmental benefits to be derived from "environmentally green" projects under ARRA's Green Project Reserve (GPR).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under WA 3-103, the contractor will continue to provide the expertise and support to assist EPA's effort to assure an effective, legal and appropriate expenditure of ARRA funds to achieve the objectives of the economic stimulus through significant program implementation and oversight. Support tasks include assisting in: tracking the program's implementation; reviewing EPA Regional ARRA implementation efforts; assisting and training EPA Regional Offices in the oversight of State ARRA programs; training and assisting States in implementing their ARRA program including tracking and providing technical assistance to applicants; developing information to assess the successful implementation of the program; and providing reports on achievements to senior EPA and Executive Branch officials, the U.S. Congress, the water industry and other stakeholders and the general public.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to enter into a sole-source contract with the North Bethesda Marriott Hotel and Conference Center to provide hotel and conference space in support of the annual NRC all employees meeting to be held October 20, 2011.
<p>The objective of the all employees meeting is to provide a forum for the Chairman and Commissioners to reflect upon NRC's accomplishments this past year, discuss the challenges ahead, and answer employee questions. The NRC requires the services of a conference center within walking distance from NRC headquarters (HQ) to allow timely access for employees. To ensure NRC employee participation, the meeting must be held within walking distance from the NRC Headquarters (HQ), located at 1555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852-2738. Historical data has shown that if the meeting location is not within walking distance of NRC HQ, then NRC employee attendance decreases by 15 percent. By holding the meeting at a facility within walking distance from NRC HQ, employees will save an estimated 35 minutes per day (approximately $13,440 per day in cost savings to the NRC) compared with traveling to a facility that is not within walking distance. Furthermore, transportation (i.e., shuttle buses, metro fare cards) for NRC employees to attend the meeting at a farther location would add considerable costs to the NRC. NRC will save approximately $49,500 in shuttle bus and approximately $13,500 in metro fare card costs.</p>
<p>The North Bethesda Marriott Hotel and Conference Center (Marriott) is the only conference center that is located within walking distance from the NRC HQ that has the capacity to accommodate approximately 2,000 attendees for the meeting. The Marriott is located approximately 0.2 miles from NRC HQ and has extensive familiarity with NRC's security and meeting requirements as demonstrated by performing the annual Regulatory Information Conference in 2010, the NRR All-Hands Meeting, the Integrated Regulatory Review Service Mission, and several other agency-wide and office-wide meetings. Therefore, the Marriott is the only conference facility that can meet NRC requirements in support of the all employees meeting.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals. Request for copies of this solicitation will not be honored unless the respondent provides evidence showing their capability to perform the required services.</p>
<br />Statutory authority:&nbsp; FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) Only one responsible source.<br />

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

The Molecular Cardiology Department (MCD) is seeking to purchase a Stopped-Flow Spectrofluorimeter in order to carry out kinetic analysis of purified myosin proteins.  This instrument is used to probe intermediate steps in the kinetic cycle in order to determine the mechanism of interaction with actin and ATP.  The machine that the Government requires must have rapid mixing capability in order to be able to measure fast reactions, low sample volume and high spectral sensitivity in order to conserve sample amounts and a programmable automatic shuttering device in order to allow the measurement of long time courses without appreciable photobleaching.  Below are the Governments required specifications.

1)  An automatic, computer controlled shuttering device to minimize photo damage during long acquisitions must be present.
2)  Flow cell must be easily removed to allow the attachment of specialized cells
3)  A small volume flow cell (5 microliters) must be included as an option
4)  The stop/waste valve should be ceramic.
5)  Data acquisition should be via an over-sampled 12 bit, 1.2 MHz A/D
6)  The flow circuit should be a vertical system with filling from the top.
7)  The machine must be capable of double mixing with no plumbing changes
8)  There must be two photomuliplier detectors.
9)  Must be capable of using a 75 W xenon lamp or a mercury-xenon lamp.
10)  The reagent shot volume should be 40 microliters or less per reagent
11)  Dead times of < 1.6 ms must be obtainable.

Evaluation Criteria
The proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria;  

1.	Meeting the required technical capabilities of the instrument 
The instrument must meet the technical requirements and first among these is that it must have a computer controlled shuttering system.

2.	Ability to deliver product within 90 days 

3.	Quality of set up and training offered 
	Technicians must be present on site to install the instrument and offer training to users.

4.	Quality of service
This will be determined by what the company promises and by conversations with colleagues who currently have the various instruments in the Government laboratories.

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors.  Therefore, the initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item supplies prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quote (RFQ) and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-46.  This purchase is reserved for small businesses, NAICS 212319, Other Crushed and Broken Stone Mining and Quarrying, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The Government intends to issue a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible quoter whose total quote is the most advantageous for the Government, price and other factors considered.
BACKGROUNDThe National Park Service (NPS) manages paved and gravel roadways within the Stehekin District of North Cascades NPS Complex and Lake Chelan National Recreation Area.  Various construction projects require the use of large granite rocks and gravel.  North Cascades National Park is currently seeking to purchase approximately 440 tons of Class 5 Rip Rap Rock.  With an option to purchase an additional 220 tons.        

DELIVERY LOCATION All rock will be delivered to Tom Courtney Tug and Barge at 1222 W. Woodin Ave. Chelan, WA 98816 and loaded directly onto a 30'x 80' barge.  Include all delivery and trucking costs to Tom Courtney Tug and Barge.  The exact delivery date(s) and size of loads shall be coordinated with the barge company (509/682-2493).  
Delivery and placement of rocks onto the barge deck will be as specified by the barge company.  We expect that some rocks may be end-dumped on the barge, if there is a layer of gravel loaded first so as not to damage the barge deck.  However, some rocks may need to be placed individually on the barge deck.
INVOICINGEach truckload of materials shall be accompanied by a delivery ticket showing the date, product, weight (as determined by a certified scale), and delivery location.  The ticket shall be in duplicate.  It is the contractor's responsibility to obtain the signature of a barge company representative upon delivery.  
Invoices shall summarize deliveries by product and be supported by signed delivery tickets.  Payment will be based on actual quantity delivered.  Payment will be by MasterCard or direct deposit (net 30 days, with contractor's option for a prompt payment discount).  Partial payments for items delivered will be allowed.  
NOXIOUS WEED PREVENTIONTo prevent the introduction of seeds from noxious weeds into Stehekin valley or onto NPS land, the Contractor shall endeavor to provide materials free of plant matter. This includes soil, seeds, vegetative matter or other debris that could contain or hold seeds.  Diffuse or spotted knapweed or rush skeleton weed are the primary noxious weeds of concern.  
DELIVERABLESClass 5 Rip Rap Rock (Qty 440 Tons).  Rip rap rock shall be hard, durable, angular rock that is resistant to weathering and water action and free of organic or other unsuitable material.  Neither the breadth nor thickness of any stone shall be less than one-third its length.  Rock shall be free of overburden, spoil, shale, and organic material (as described above).  Do not use shale, rock with shale seams, or other fissile of fissured rock that may break into smaller pieces in the process of handling and placing.  Furnish spalls and rock fragments to provide a stable dense mass.
Rip rap rock shall conform to the following:Class 5 Rip Rap

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-10-R-2111F42 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32. This is small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611.
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or <br />the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 3723692, Fax: (202) 475, 3904.</p>

<DESC>Question 1:<BR>           I wanted to ask the amount of required site visits to Aberdeen over the first year of this contract?<BR>Answer:<BR>	The number of deliveries will depend on the amount of salt used from each dome. This depends on the weather. This could also mean more or less than the 1,500 tons requested.<BR><BR>Question 2:<BR>            I was wondering if the Road Salt needs to be delivered over multiple site trips or at one particular point where we deliver all 1500 short tons (performance period)? <BR>Answer:<BR>	The salt would be delivered to only two sites, one in Aberdeen, MD. and the other in Edgewood, MD. The amount of salt will vary depending on the amount of salt required to keep the domes full.<BR> <BR>Question 3: <BR>In reference to the above subject could you please provide the actual delivery address for both Aberdeen PG and for Edgewood? <BR>Answer:<BR>      The Aberdeen, MD. location is Bldg 550B3 (near the Deer Shack) and the Edgewood, MD. site is the salt dome near Bldg E2194.<BR>

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS TO ADVISE INDUSTRY OF A CHANGE TO THE SOLICITATION NUMBER OF THE KIRTLAND AFB BASE MAINTENANCE CONTRACT (BMC) EFFORT AND TO RELEASE THE INDUSTRY DAY BRIEFING AND RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS/COMMENTS SUBMITTED BY INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO THE POSTING OF THE BMC DRAFT RFP ON 06 OCT 10.<br />The BMC solicitation number will change from FA9401-09-R-0005 to FA9401-11-R-0003. The reasons for the solicitation number change are as follows: The original solicitation number was assigned to this effort in Fiscal Year (FY) 2009. As a result of the extended time spent on this effort to date, the Government's FY's have change over from FY2009 to FY2011, therefore, the solicitation number FA9401-09-R-0005 will be revised to FA9401-R-11-0003. Also, due to this requirement being determined to be a Commercial Service, the model contract form will change from a Standard Form 33 (SF 33) to a SF 1449. The contract will be awarded using Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12 and FAR Part 15 clauses and their supplements.<br />In addition, the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center PKOC, is releasing the BMC Industry Day briefing slides, held on 28 Oct 10, and the Questions/Comments submitted by Industry in response to the FBO posting of the BMC Draft RFP on 06 Oct 10. <br />All future postings to FBO for this requirement will utilize solicitation number FA9401-11-R-0003. The final BMC RFP is currently projected to post to FBO in the Spring of 2011.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Scientific Visualization StudioSupport which was posted on December 1. 2010. There are no changes to the RFI.	This is aposting of questions and answers.QUESTION: How many personnel with Autodesk Maya and Pixar RenderMan are required throughthis procurement?  If not all GST subcontractor personnel are experienced in Autodesk Mayand Pixar RenderMan, does the subject RFI still requires that all proposed personnel havesuch experience?  Are the proposed personnel also required to have experienced with NASAsystems/data (e.g. HDF) used at Goddard? ANSWER: The goal is to have personnel with experience in scientific visualization using aprofessional computer graphics modeling/rendering system with significant flexibility inprogrammability and adaptability, such as a Maya/Renderman system.  Such a systemcombines professional design tools and very high quality output capability with theflexibility to use actual scientific data in the system.  All personnel involved in thiswork will be using the existing SVS Maya/Renderman system, which already includes manyin-house extensions for scientific visualization. Currently, the minimum number ofrequired personnel with experience in this area is 3, where each scientific visualizeracts independently to convey accurate science by both identifying/acquiring/processingappropriate data and designing/rendering the visualizations.  QUESTION: How many technically qualified personnel should be proposed with resumes aspart of the 4 page response?ANSWER:  The purpose of the RFI is to identify commercial capability to perform thisscientific visualization work.	An indication of the number and experience of personnelcurrently involved in such work will be helpful, but personnel do not need to be proposedfor this RFI.QUESTION: Revisiting the SIVO web pages, it seems that most of the SIVO work is relatedto the development of visualization systems, software and tools for the science dataacquired from science/mission data archives (e.g. MODIS at GDAAC or EDC DACC).	Does SIVOcurrently process any raw or pre-processed satellite image/science data to generateLevels 1-4 science data products for any satellite mission?ANSWER:  The Scientific Visualization Studio (SVS) is part of SIVO, but is not identicalto it.	The SVS is the subject of this RFI, and the SVS has no responsibility for thecreation of such data products.  The SVS may assist organizations with the responsibilityto produce such products, or may prototype visualization systems using new technologies,but the SVS has no operational or data generation responsibility.QUESTION: Does any of the SIVO servers and/or systems acquire any satellite mission datain (near)-real-time to generate, display and/or animate images/data to provide/supportimage/science data quality assurance function on the mission? Or support missionoperations center (MOC) operations?ANSWER: No.  See the previous answer. QUESTION: Does SIVO anticipate an increase in its workload during the coming years due tosome new missions going operational?  Or, the new missions do not really affect SIVOworkload.  What demand factors affects SIVO workload?  Outreach community?  Sciencecommunity?  NASA internal mission demands? ANSWER:  In terms of numbers of personnel, SVS workload does not critically depend onthese factors.	The SVS must propose for new work in order to expand in any area.  Anincrease in SVS workload is possible but not guaranteed. The due date for responses has not changed.Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  Thesedocuments will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWWbrowser application.

<DESC>The following changes are noted below from the original announcement:
The required number of pages for technical quotes on page 2, "Technical Submission" Section, has changed from 10 pages to 25 pages.
Incorrect FAR Provision 52.212-3 on page 7 was replaced with corrected FAR Provision 52.212-3.
Submitted technical questions has been responded to, and included in this Amendment to the solicitation.  The following are the questions with responses:
Q:  1.  Could you clarify precisely the shrimp species that should be covered in the scope of work?  The statement of work identifies shrimp as Penaeus.  Many of the species formerly classified in the genus Penaeus have been reassigned to new genera in the family Penaeidae.  Thus, the common brackish water, whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) is now classified as Litopenaeus vannamei.  Today, the most commonly cultivated "shrimp" is Macrobrachium rosenbergii, also known as the giant river prawn.  Penaeus varieties are produced inland in low salinity water in some southern states.  Does the scope of work cover the latter species or the former, or both?  
A:  Both, however be sure to only address the freshwater species for the freshwater contract and be careful not to include saltwater species as there is a separate contract for that.
Q:  2.  What are the reasons for the choice of species?  Large-mouth bass, bream and freshwater shrimp are produced on a relatively small scale in US aquaculture.
A:  The Farm Bill specifically mandates that these species be included.
Q:  3.  Is the intention to explore insurance cover for aquaculture production of these species for all of the following: food, fee fishing, and recreational or capture fisheries stock enhancement?
A:  No
Q:  4.  Is the intention to explore insurance cover for the production of fingerlings for sale?  
A:  Yes
Q:  5.  Can RMA make available the various USDA/RMA/FCIC funded studies that were undertaken as part of the six-year National Risk Management Feasibility Program for Aquaculture (2001 to 2007)?
A:  Yes, PDF of previous studies is in the Aquaculture attachment included with solicitation located at:  http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/solic/solicitations.asp Q:  6.  In very broad terms what were the general conclusions of this program? 
A:  This information will be provided in the attached study included with solicitation located at:  http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/solic/solicitations.asp
Q:  7.  What were the conclusions on the availability of data for the purposes of identification of average yields, and product pricing and rating?  
A:  This information will be provided in the attached study included with solicitation located at:  http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/solic/solicitations.asp
Q:  8.  What actions were taken to review new products on the basis of the output from the program?
A:  This information will be provided in the attached study included with solicitation located at:  http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/solic/solicitations.asp
Q:  9.  Is there any information available to RMA that would identify how many aquaculture enterprises are covered under current revenue products such as AGR-Lite?  
A:  This information will be provided contingent upon award. 
Q:  10.  Bearing in mind the long list of requirements specified in the Statement of Work, the 10-page limit for submissions represents a serious constraint on description of approach, methodology, project management, quality control, and capabilities.  Can the page limit be amended to 20 pages?   
A:  Yes, the page limitation will be changed to 25 pages.
Q:  11.  The solicitation includes a list that includes farming a number of freshwater species including shrimp (penaeus).  Many of the family Penaeidae are marine organisms and are farmed in a marine environment.  The prawns, such as the Macrobrachium, are freshwater farmed.  Can you clarify which shrimp or prawn species are included in the solicitation as the risks from freshwater farming differ from marine? 
A:  This solicitation is focusing only on the freshwater species.  AQD has issued a second solicitation for Saltwater species.  Many of the marine farmed species will fit better under the Saltwater project. 

When submitting quotes, offerers shall acknowledge amendment 2 to the solicitation within the cover letter of the quote.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions posed by interested parties.  
1)	Do most facilities use all three WiFi channels in 2.4GHz: 1, 6 and 11? Both Cisco and Aruba do automatic and dynamic channel selection based on load distribution and interference mitigation. The guest WiFi would have great impact to that, although it's very doubtful that they use more than a fraction of the available total capacity in the 2.4GHz channels.
ANSWER:  Yes, it is standard practice to assign all three US non-overlapping 2.4 GHz channels (1, 6, and 11) for Dynamic Channel Assignment.
 
2)	Do any/most facilities also use 5.8GHz (11a/n)? If so, is most WiFi traffic in this band?
ANSWER:  The Design does include the 5.8 GHz band as well (802.11a), this is currently set aside for our Voice and Video applications.  Given new technologies with RRM and interference avoidance, it is probable that all sites will begin to make use of dual band systems
3)	Are there any required RF signal field strength limitations imposed by VA for 2.4 or 5.8GHz? This would be microvolts per cubic meter, much as in the FCC regulations for health and safety, but also applied to medical device impacts, e.g., in the CCU ward for wireless telemetry devices (which do not operate in WiFi/ISM bands).
ANSWER:  The Government is not aware of any but is checking with the Biomedical community.
4)	Likewise, are there any required RF signal transmission duty cycle limitations imposed by VA for 2.4 or 5.8GHz? This would be in percent, or be mandated use of frequency hopping as is the case for 900MHz (n/a here).
ANSWER:  The Government is not aware of any but is checking with the Biomedical community.
5)	Are there fire code regulations for devices below/outside the plenum space, e.g., ceiling mounted access points? In-plenum devices have common code requirements. 
ANSWER:  The National Wireless Project makes standard practice of installing below plenum spaces (i.e. below ceiling installations).  However, there are specific guidelines for Elevator, Stairwell, and Mental Health areas which take into account Life Safety, Fire Code, Patient Safety, and JCAHO requirements.

THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): Dix Corporation, W912BV-10-C-1013<br><br>As part of Operations and Maintenance, Army, Recover Act, this modification has been issued to Dix Corporation, to perform the following work:  This modification purchases all the long lead items and materials to complete the following work:   Trolley Bumpers and Stops--A trolley bumper and stop system shall be designed and manufactured to cushion and stop the trolley at the limits of travel as per ASME B30.2 Section 2-1.82.  The trolley bumpers must be energy-absorbing with the capacity to stop the trolley when traveling with power off in either direction at a speed of at least 50 percent of rated load speed.  The bumper and stop system will be designed in such a way as to operate in both upstream and downstream directions without interfering with the existing walkways.  The bumper stops will be a bolt down design so they can be temporarily removed or relocated in the future.  Gantry Bumpers and Stops--To achieve the same travel as with bumpers removed, new bumpers shall be designed and manufactured to meet ASME B30.2 Section 2-1.8.2 standards.  The bumpers shall be designed to achieve energy-absorbing (or energy-dissipating) capacity to stop the gantry when traveling with power off in either direction at a speed of at least 40 percent of rated load speed.  The bumpers and installation brackets shall be designed to install on the gantry legs at the existing bumper location and allow the crane to stop at maximum travel preventing the gantry wheels or sweeps from coming into contact with the concrete stops.  Modify Trolley Rail Sweeps--New trolley rail sweeps shall be designed and manufactured to replace the existing sweeps and meet ASME B30.2-2005 Section 2-1.9 standards.  They will be designed to mount in the existing sweep locations and not interfere with normal trolley operations.

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with CT Corporation System, 111 18th Avenue, 13th Floor, New York, New York, 10011, for continued hosting and use of the CaseVault case management web collaboration tool. The modification to existing commercial purchase order Tcc-10-HQ-C-0016 will increase the ceiling of the purchase order to allow for use of the services through 7/1/2011, at a level reflective of actual use over the past year. The estimated award amount is $350,000. The purchase order was initially awarded on a sole-source basis to CT Corp after extensive market research determined that no other source offered the technical capability and experience for direct integration with iBlaze software from CT Summation. CaseVault is currently supporting litigation cases for the OCC and continued use of CaseVault is required so as not to disrupt current activities. There are currently more than 3 million pages loaded into the system. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; a solicitation document will not be issued. All information received within 7 days after the date of this notice with pricing and sufficient technical documentation to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement will be considered by the OCC.
