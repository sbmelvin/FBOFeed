<SUBJECT>Feasible Amount of Mass Reduction for Light Duty Vehicle for Model Years 2017-2025
<SOLNBR>DTNH22-10-R-11111
<CONTACT>Peter Shultz, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 366-9561, Fax (202) 366-9555, Email pete.shultz@.dot.gov
<DESC>Introduction: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). NHTSA has been issuing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for the last 30 years under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA). EPCA requires DOT to establish average fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks at "the maximum feasible average fuel economy level that the Secretary [of DOT] decides the manufacturers can achieve in that model year." When setting "maximum feasible" fuel economy standards, DOT is required to "consider technological feasibility, economic practicability, the effect of other motor vehicle standards of the Government on fuel economy, and the need of the United States to conserve energy."<br />The CAFE standards will increase annually, and for Model Year (MY) 2016 are estimated to require a combined industry-wide fleet fuel economy of 34.1 mpg. On May 21, 2010, President Obama directed NHTSA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to work with the State of California and take the next steps to improve fuel economy and reduce Green House Gas emissions from mobile sources for model years 2017-2025. Based on agency's discussions with manufacturers about how they plan to comply with CAFE standards in those model years, the agency anticipates that the industry will make use of vehicle mass reduction as a means for reducing vehicle fuel consumption in the future. <br />Using state-of-the-art computer modeling, the contractor will design, develop and validate a light weight vehicle design of a mid-size passenger car based on a model year 2008 or newer Honda Accord or equivalent mass efficiency mid-size passenger car using advanced design, material and manufacturing process projected to be available during the MY 2017-2025 timeframe. The engineering design shall include sufficient detail so that computer modeling can be performed to demonstrate crashworthiness of the vehicle concept. The contractor shall also provide a comprehensive cost estimate for the design, including both detailed direct (piece) and indirect cost estimates. The proposed design must be commercially feasible for high volume production (around 200,000 units per year). The power train of this concept vehicle should be downsized to match the newly designed light-weighted vehicle to maintain vehicle acceleration and/or towing comparing to the baseline vehicle. The contractor should provide an incremental mass difference between the powertrain chosen and the baseline powertrain without a full scaled powertrain study.
<p>&nbsp;Contract Award: NHTSA intends to award a single, cost-reimbursement contract for twelve (12) months. The contract may also include a provision by which three (3) one-year option periods can be exercised (in one-year increments) resulting in a total possible performance period of four (4) years.</p>
<p>The Request for Proposals will be available for full and open competition.</p>
<p>Solicitation: The solicitation will be available for downloading from www.fbo.gov on or about September 20, 2010. The anticipated award date for this resultant contract is expected to be on or about December 17, 2010.</p>

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION
Phytoplankton analysis on field collected phytoplankton samples from Lake Mead, AZ-NV.
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial service prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 
(ii) This solicitation, R10PS80803 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).
(iii) This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-43.
(iv) This solicitation is 100% small business set-aside. NAICS Code is 541620. Size standard is $7.0 millions of dollars.
(v) This combined synopsis/solicitation is for the following commercial services: Phytoplankton analysis on field collected phytoplankton samples from Lake Mead, AZ-NV.
(vi) Description of requirements for the services to be acquired: For 240 samples of Phytoplankton analyses are required on field-collected phytoplankton samples from Lake Mead, AZ-NV. Samples will be collected on a monthly basis, preserved with glutaraldyde, and shipped to the contractor. In order to maintain consistency with the established database, it is essential that the contractor use procedures that are the same as those that have been used for the past twenty (20) years.
Phytoplankton need to be identified to genus, and species where possible. Results must to be reported on a monthly basis for all stations sampled, both as cell counts (cells/mL) and biovolume (m3/mL).  Raw data must be provided in Excel spreadsheets, with algal genera sorted by division for each sampling station. For presentation purposes, both algal cell counts and biovolumes must also be lumped into the following major groups: Diatoms (Bacillariophyta), Green algae (Chlorophyta), Cryptomonads (Cryptophyta), Yellow-brown algae (Chrysophyta), Blue-green algae (Cyanophyta), Euglenoids (Euglenophyta), Dinoflagellates (Pyrrhophyta), Miscellaneous algae (includes microflagellates, unidentifiable cysts, and Gonyostomum semen, which is in the division Chloromonadophyta).
Samples are to be processed using a research-grade compound microscope equipped with variable optics, including Phase Optics (400x), epifluorescence, and a trinocular head for photography.  The magnification used will depend on the size of dominant taxa, and the size and number of particulates.  Counting is to be done at multiple magnifications to correctly enumerate and identify taxa present that can vary by several orders of magnitude in size.  If samples are dominated by cells below 10-20 ?m, or if cells are fragile and difficult to identify, the majority of counting will be completed at 400x-1000x.  A minimum of 400 natural units per sample will be enumerated, exclusive of miscellaneous microflagellates.  QA/QC will be performed on approximately every tenth sample for random distribution and identification verification.
Biovolume measurements will be completed by measuring the greatest axial linear dimension (GALD), which is the length, width and depth of different aspects of the colony or cell.  Cell and colony shapes will be approximated to a geometric figure and or figures and the appropriate calculations made.  These measurements provide a general indication of the edibility of an algal cell for zooplankton, with GALD measurement of <30 m usually considered edible and GALD >30 m usually considered inedible.  Up to a total of 30 natural units (sometimes higher on exceptionally variable taxa) will be measured for each taxa depending on variability and number encountered. The use of literature values for biovolume calculations is not acceptable.
Raw data are to be recorded on count sheets and transferred to a data analysis and management program. The program should retain original input data for future reference and error checking. 
Permanent mounts should be prepared for each sample and maintained in an archive in case questions arise concerning species identification.  While this increases analytical costs, results from the Lake Mead limnology project have the potential to affect billions of dollars in future construction and access to archived samples could prove to be extremely useful if questions on changes in algal characteristics arise.
The HPMA method (Crumpton, 1987, a simple and reliable method for making permanent mounts of phytoplankton for light and fluorescence microscopy. Limnol. Oceanogr. 32: 1154-1159) should be used to produce the archival algal sample slides because it provides an optically clear background while permanently infiltrating and preserving the sample for archival purposes. Original samples should be retained in case clarification or further identification is necessary.
The initial award will be for samples collected during calendar year 2010. Up to two additional option years may be included, depending upon Reclamation's ability to obtain funding for future sampling. Approximately twenty (20) samples will be collected each month, with a maximum of 250 samples collected during the year.
(vii) This work should start in September-October 2010. The work to be performed is located in section (v).
(viii) The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition.
(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The Government will award a fixed price purchase order to the best value offeror conforming to the terms and requirements of the solicitation. 
1) Technical Capability - The offeror's proposal will be evaluated to the extent the technical capability demonstrates experience and proficiency in 1) Previous experience with algal identification and enumeration, 2) Previous experience on providing data for long-term monitoring programs, 3) Previous experience with the preparation of archival slides, 4) Previous experience with algal identification at Lake Mead, which is necessary to maintain continuity with existing monitoring programs.
2)  Past Performance - Past performance evaluation will focus on the quality of previous work produced by the offeror.  Key considerations include: (1) collection of phytoplankton samples 2) satisfactory performance in collection of phytoplankton samples under Federal contract.  This factor is less important when compared to technical capability.
3) Price- Technical capability and past performances, when combined, are significantly more important when compared to price.
The relative order of all evaluation factors is (1) Technical Capability, (2) Past Performance, (3) Price.  When combined technical capability, past performance are significantly more important than price.
(x) The offeror must have completed the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) which is the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items. The web site address is https://orca.bpn.gov/.
