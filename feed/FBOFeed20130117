In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION OF FLIGHT CRITICAL SYSTEMS FOR NEXTGEN AA INTEGRATED MODEL CHECKING AND SIMULATION OF NEXTGEN AUTHORITY AND AUTONOMY. NASA/ARC intends to continue the work begun at the University of Virginia (UoV) under the existing principal investigator (PI) who will be taking a new position at Drexel University and the end of January 2013. NASA intends to fulfill this requirement with the same PI through Drexel University. Since the PI has already been working on this effort and has obtained the unique experience necessary to fulfill this requirement, it is imperative that the work continue with the existing team to avoid delay and duplication of effort. Based on the above, it is neither advantageous nor cost effective for the government to re-compete this on-going requirement. Since this is an ongoing effort it would not be advantageous to the Government to re-compete the ongoing requirements. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 24, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	 .

<p>Unit of Issue: EA</p>
<p>Destination Information: FOB Destination, Inspection and Acceptance at Destination</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: 126 days</p>
<p>The Small Business size standard is 500 employees. <br />This is an unrestricted acquisition.</p>
<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.<br />This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>The solicitation (RFP) will be available in DIBBS on its issue date of 02/04/13.</p>

<DESC>Arcata Associates, Inc. has a requirement for 1 each 100 Watt L/S Band-Redundant solid state power amplifier (SSPA), enclosed in NEMA weatherproof envirement enclosure (outdoor application) with remote RS0233 interface WV Model 1750-1850/2025-2120/100PA-R Rev N/A. Arcata Associates, INc. intends to purchase the items from WV COMMUNICATIONS, INC. 1125A BUSINESS CENTER CIRCLE NEWBURY PARK, CA 91320. WV Communications has a long standing reputation of high reliability transmitter equipment which has been demonstrated at many other ranges as well as here at DFRC. DFRC currently has two identical systems to the one being procured used on the MOF1 and on the MFTS (ATF2) systems. This system has proven to be very reliable and has never failed during mission support regardless of the environment.  DFRC had procured with the MOF unit numerous spare components that can be shared between the MOF, MFTS and Triplex systems saving the Government money by not having to procure additional spare components. Other vendors have a long lead time of nearly 12 months. WV communications can deliver the equipment within approximately 120 day ARO. Due to the criticality of the Triplex systems uplink capability, time is of the essence.  One vendor (from an earlier procurement) has yet to provide equipment that meets our demanding thermal requirements, below freezing in the winter and exceeding 120 degrees F. in the summertime (we've suffered repeated failures due to temperature of moderate levels, the system cannot be used in the heat of the summer). The criticality of these systems dictates that the system provides reliable uplink commanding regardless of the environment. If the aircraft fly, we must support with reliable equipment. Loss of an uplink signal often terminates a critical mission. Arcata Associates, Inc.intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. local time on Feburary 01, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by Arcata Associates, Inc. not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Arcata Associates, Inc. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>Arcata Associates, Inc. has a requirement for IT Project Support. Arcata Associates, Inc intends to extend the existing requirement for the Consulting Services of Cycronix 21 Surrey Lane, PO Box 6061 Laconia, NH 03246 for period of performance that extends to January 15, 2014. Cycronix has been chosen as the source to provide these services based on the following reasons: Cycronix personnel formerly supported the efforts of the existing Global Test Range Development Lab at DFRC which supports NASA in the research, engineering, development, and operation of prototype systems that serve non-traditional range customer groups typically interested in off-range operations.  Cycronix personnel participated in the development and integration of DataTurbine into both embedded devices and enterprise-class data systems that include but are not limited to  data systems of in-house design, commodity devices using the Android operating system, systems on aircraft, and systems running on virtualized hardware in the data center.  Cycronix personnel have extensive development, design, and system architecture experience related to their support of previous DFRC projects.	Previous experience of Cycronix personnel with DFRC research, engineering, development, and implementation efforts contribute to their unique understanding of the Dryden development environment.  Code MI requires the ability to expand its capacity to meet its needs in IT systems engineering, application innovation, and strategic architecture and infrastructure planning. We envision flexible expansion via support services from Cycronix on an as requested basis.   We envision sequences of small software development and IT infrastructure design oriented projects with delivery deadlines typically on the order of a few weeks to projects lasting several months. Arcata Associates, Inc. intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. local time on January 28, 2013.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters Office of Education, in cooperation with the NASA Johnson Space Center and other NASA Centers, is releasing a Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) for NASA Internships.  On or about January 16, 2013, this CAN will be available electronically through the NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES) at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/	 and then clicking the link through the menu listings "Solicitations" to "Open Solicitations." Institutions eligible to respond to this CAN are limited to higher education institutions, nonprogit organizations, and consortia or groups of organizations and institutions serving higher education students, whose mission includes capturing student interest and/or improving student performance in science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) or related fields.  The estimated annual value of the award is $3,000,000 to $10,000,000 per year, for a period of performance not to exceed 5 years. It is anticipated that this award will be an indefinite quantity and cost reimbursement cooperative agreement.	The recipient of this single award will support sub-agreements at 10 NASA centers delineated by unique cooperative agreement numbers assigned by the NASA Shared Services Center. All centers will follow the same guidelines. The breakdown by center is necessary to ensure costs are tracked correctly.  This will allow each NASA facility to easily transfer funding from any technical or administrative organization for support of NASA Internships.  The single entity recipient of this award will be responsible for identifying and submitting costs and drawdowns per each centers cooperative agreement number. Due to the variability of this funding model, the successful proposer must have an accounting system considered adequate for tracking and reporting costs applicable to the agreement from multiple funding sources. (See Table 2, Section II for a list of current NASA internship locations.) NASA is looking for a flexible and scalable partner who can be innovative and impactful while delivering, sustainable, demonstrable and measureable results. A Notice of Intent (NOI) is requested to assist NASA in assessing the possible response to this CAN; and to determine the number of subject matter experts required for the Proposal Review Panel. NOIs should be submitted by the proposer to NSPIRES by midnight (11:59 p.m.) Eastern Time, February 13, 2013. Instructions for submitting the NOI and the proposal in NSPIRES are found under Section III of this announcement (Proposal and Submission Information). Interested proposers must register with NSPIRES before it can be accessed for use.  In order to avoid any conflict of interest in assigning reviewers to proposals, please include a list of participating/partnering institutions in your NOI. All proposals in response to this CAN must be submitted electronically via the NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES) (http://nspires.nasaprs.com	) or Grants.gov.   Electronic proposals must be submitted in their entirety by 11:59:59 PM Eastern Time on the proposal due date of March 13, 2013. Respondents without access to the Web or who experience difficulty using the NSPIRES proposal site (http://nspires.nasaprs.com     ) may contact the Help Desk at nspireshelp@nasaprs.com or call 202-479-9376. This solicitation leading to the award of a Cooperative Agreement is issued pursuant to title 14 CFR Part 1260 for educational and nonprofit institutions and 14 CFR part 1274 for commercial organizations. Notwithstanding the posting of this opportunity at FedBizOpps.gov, Grants.gov, or at both sites, NASA reserves the right to determine the appropriate award instrument for each proposal selected pursuant to this announcement. The points of contact for technical and programmatic questions regarding this CAN are: Technical Officers:  Ms. Carolyn Knowles Office of Education NASA Headquarters 300 E Street, SW Washington, DC 20546 Carolyn.knowles-1@nasa.gov Mr. Robert Musgrove Office of Education Johnson Space Center 2101 NASA Parkway Houston, TX 77058 robert.p.musgrove@nasa.gov	 NASA Internship Solicitation Support: Tamra Ross NASA Research & Education Support 2345 Crystal Drive  Suite 500 Arlington, VA 22202 tkross@nasaprs.com	 202-479-9030, Ext. 213 202-479-0511 (fax) Questions regarding this announcement must be presented in writing to Tamra Ross at tkross@nasaprs.com within 30 calendar days of the release date in order that responses may be obtained and disseminated within 5 business days.

<DESC>The Navy Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU), Panama City, FL, intends to award a sole-source firm fixed price contract to the Geotechnical Instruments (U.K.) LTD, Sovereign House, Leamington Spa UK CV31 3JR for three new Hyperbaric CO2/O2 Monitors. Geotechnical Instruments is the original manufacturer of the Hyperbaric Monitor and has worked with the US Navy for a period of four years developing, testing, and modifying it to meet the US Navy requirements.  Services can only be satisfied from the original source for this contract due to Geotechnical Instruments experience of twenty years manufacturing, testing, and servicing Hyperbaric Monitors for the US Navy.  Geotechnical Instrument put extensive effort in manufacturing a second generation prototype monitor using current state of the art electronics.
  It would take another manufacturer a considerable amount of time to produce a monitor for testing as Geotechnical Instrument is the only source with the in-depth knowledge of Hyperbaric Monitors needed by the US Navy.  Thus, Geotechnical Instrument is the only source that can perform this requirement.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
  The Department of Defense will no longer award contracts to contractors not registered in the System for Award Management Registration (SAM) database. Lack of registration in the SAM database will make the offer ineligible for award; Registration may be accomplished by accessing the SAM website at http://www.sam.gov/.    NAICS 334513 applies.  Small Business Size standard associated with this code is 500 employees.  PSC 6630.  Contract Specialist: Mr. Corey Rezner, NEDU, 321 Bullfinch Road, Panama City, FL 32407-7015, (850) 230-3221.

This is a Request for Information (RFI) by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD). This RFI is published in accordance with FAR Part 15.201(e), and is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), or a commitment by the U.S.
 Government, nor should it be construed as such. Respondents are advised that NSWCDD is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of any information submitted in response to this RFI. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or reimburse RFI preparation costs incurred by any offeror when providing the information requested under this notice. If a solicitation is released at a future date, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.

It is the responsibility of any potential offeror to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.


Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) has a requirement for the manufacture, assembly, inspection, and acceptance of Gun Weapon Systems (GWS) components such as; Ammunition Handling System (AHS), Trainable Gun Mounts (TGM), Gun Computer Cabinets (GCC), Gun Power Cabinets (GPC) assemblies, and all future redesigned and upgraded assemblies that come from research and development stages of BMS programs.
 All of the mentioned assemblies are used for future BMS airborne gunship applications. Similar GWS components have been produced for previous Battle Management System (BMS) programs with little to no consistency between manufacturers. This effort will concentrate on having awarded streamlined machining and manufacturing companies manufacture future GWS components, which are designed by BMS engineers. This will improve the efficiency during the production and integration stages of the BMS programs. The total effort will cover the manufacturing, assembling, inspection, and delivery of future GWS components built for BMS programs. 

The Contractor shall receive a Technical Data Package (TDP) or drawings from the Government, which includes all design and fabrication specifications, mechanical drawings, and assembly procedures for 30mm and 105mm GWS systems.
 The Contractor shall inspect the TDP or drawings, and maintain close communication during the decomposition and manufacturing preparation stage. The Contractor shall manufacture all parts within the TDP or drawings. The Contractor shall assemble the particular GWS components with the manufactured parts. The Contractor shall follow all tolerances and specifications given by the Government, and assemble the GWS components. The Contractor shall deliver the assembled GWS system or components to NSWCDD where it will be fully integrated into the Gun Weapon Pallet (GWP). 

The Contractor shall have the following certifications;
-ISO 9001
-AS9100

The Contractor shall have and use a manufacturing facility located within 5 hours of NSWCDD.
 Additionally, NSWCDD engineers require the ability to respond to urgent or rapid development prototyping or technical and developmental changes to technical specifications. This primarily happens before final approval of a TDP, which requires on-the-spot test fits or certain minor changes. The purpose behind this is to prevent spending substantial Government dollars for production parts, which is considered wasteful by the Government. 

The Contractor shall identify any long-lead components that are necessary for a fully assembled Ammunition Can and TGM.

The Contractor shall revise and make the same changes that are documented by the Government during the Governments production and integration cycles.

The Contractor shall submit Engineering Change Proposal(s) (ECP) to the Government that addresses any issues found during manufacture and assembly process.
 

The Contractor shall document all manufacturing and assembly processes and changes, and submit the documentation to the Government.

The Contractor shall divide the deliverable items into three cost items for logistics of Delivery Orders; AHS, TGM, GPC, GCC, and non-manufactured items. 

The Contractor shall receive, track, inventory, issue, and monitor all material, equipment, technical data, and logistic support items throughout the entire acquisition process. 

The Government has a strong desire to fabricate/manufacture as many of the components as possible in house. 

The Contractor shall have ability to fabricate and assemble sheet metal parts in house.

The Contractor shall have the capability and facilities to weld.
 

The Contractor shall have the capability to machine parts with dimensions up to 20 feet.

The Contractor shall have the capability to machine parts weighing up to 2,000 pounds. 

The Contractor shall be capable of machining directly from SolidWorks CAD models.

The Contractor shall have the capability of various heat treating processes. 

The Contractor shall have the capability of various specialized coating capabilities to include phosphate coating and hard cote anodize. 

The Contractor shall develop a shipping plan to deliver assembled items to NSWC, B198.
 After this shipping plan has been approved by the Government, the Contractor shall use this plan throughout the contract period of performance. The Contractor shall not change this delivery method or plan unless approved by the COR. 

The Contractor shall provide monthly progress reports.

The Contractor shall participate in any teleconferences with NSWC as required.

The Contractor shall participate in a contract kick-off meeting with NSWC and shall provide presentation materials.

The Contractor shall develop and conduct a Quality Assurance Plan. After approval from the Government, the Quality Assurance Plan shall be placed under Contractor configuration control. Any revision shall require Government approval.

<DESC>This posting is NOT a Request for Proposals.
SPAWAR Systems Center (SSC) Atlantic intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to procure services and solutions in support of SSC Atlantic's mission to rapidly deliver and support solutions that enable information dominance for our Naval, Joint, National and Coalition Warfighters.
SSC Atlantic has requirements for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Combat Systems, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C5ISR) electronics and communications services and solutions in support of mission capabilities within its Portfolio mission areas.  SSC Atlantic has developed an acquisition strategy centered on these primary business portfolios.  The proposed acquisition ("8(a) Incubator") augments this strategy by providing a multiple-award vehicle through which SSC Atlantic can meet its mission needs while providing an opportunity for firms in the developmental phase of the 8(a) Business Development Program to build their competitive and institutional know-how in a competitive environment.
The proposed acquisition anticipates a multiple award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Performance-Based, Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee type contract with provisions for Firm-Fixed-Price and Fixed-Price incentive orders.  The expected period of performance is a one-year base period with two one-year option periods.  The total potential ceiling is estimated at $99M. Successful offerors will share the ceiling until it is exhausted by task orders.  No task orders or funding are guaranteed beyond the minimum guarantee stated in the forthcoming RFP.  It is anticipated that some task orders awarded under the proposed contract may be issued on a sole-source basis under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c)(5) and FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(E).
Places of performance will include SSC Atlantic and SSC Atlantic customer locations, CONUS and OCONUS, but primarily within the Charleston, SC; New Orleans, LA; and Tidewater (Virginia) areas.
Eligibility will be limited to those firms in the developmental phase of the 8(a) Business Development Program (13 CFR 124.507(c)(1)), SBA approved 8(a) joint ventures (13 CFR 124.513(a)(1)) where at least one participant is in the developmental phase of the 8(a) Business Development Program at offer submission, and SBA approved Mentor-Protg joint ventures provided the Protg firm is still in the developmental phase of the 8(a) Business Development Program at the time the offer is submitted (13 CFR 124.520(d) (1) and 13 CFR 124.507(c)(1)).  No informal or undocumented joint ventures will be eligible.
Please note:  Eligibility requirements will be strictly enforced, and documents clearly establishing a firm or joint venture's eligibility will be requested in the forthcoming RFP.  Firms failing to provide sufficient documentation will NOT be evaluated.  When the RFP is posted please read the documentation requirements carefully.
Due to time constraints in the RFP process and the high workload at the SBA, the Government recommends requesting appropriate documents from SBA as soon as possible (prior to issuance of the RFP if possible).  Documents from CCR, SAM, or other government-wide systems will not be sufficient.
Please see the document attached to this posting for details regarding eligibility and documentation of eligibility.
Awards will be made using the tradeoff process to firms determined to represent the best value to the Government.  At this time, the Government expects to evaluate technical capability, management approach, past performance, and cost, with technical capability, management approach, and past performance being more important than cost.
As soon as practicable, a more detailed draft Performance Work Statement, Section L, and Section M will be posted along with a forthcoming market survey (prior to RFP release) that will invite eligible firms to provide input on their capability to perform the proposed requirements and the proposed evaluation process.
At this time, the Government does not anticipate utilizing specific dollar value limitations for determining relevance of experience/capabilities.
Please submit all questions/comments concerning this announcement, in writing only, to matthew.g.hudson@navy.mil.

This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in these data if it has been obtained from another source without restriction. A contract shall not be awarded as a result of this RFI. The US Army Contracting Command, Fort Dix, NJ, on behalf of Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (PM CAS) is interested in gathering information to further its understanding of current Fuze industry capability. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command (ACC)-New Jersey and the Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems (PM-CAS) is conducting market research to identify potential sources that are capable of supplying the FMU-153A/B Point Detonating (PD)/Delay Fuze used in 105mm High Explosive (HE) Artillery Projectiles on U. S. Air Force Special Operations gunships. <br>  <br> The FMU 153 A/B fuze will be for use by the United States Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). The FMU-153A/B fuze may be set for either PD or Delay depending on the type of target. In the PD mode the fuze may be used against soft targets or for registration on hard targets. In the Delay mode, the fuze may be used against hard targets where penetration is desired. The FMU-153 A/B fuze is basically the same as the MK399 MOD1, except for a heavier nose section.  It is used in the Air Force 105mm weapon against Air Force ground targets.  The FMU 153 A/B PD/Delay fuze is a combination of two (2) proven fuze designs: The MK399 MOD1 PD/Delay and the MK407 MOD1 PD/Delay fuzes. The combination is the packaging of the internal components from the MK407 MOD1 into the body of the MK399 MOD1. The repackaging was direct and simple since the cavities in the fuze bodies are the same dimensions. Therefore, there was no need to redesign parts or closing screws due to size changes.  The Government anticipates soliciting offerors under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3) and FAR 6.302-3(b)(1)(iv)(B), Industrial Mobilization; Engineering, Development, or Research Capability; or Expert Services, from companies within the National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB) in order to maintain or create the required domestic capability within the U.S., its outlying areas, and Canada.  The anticipated award will be a single 5 year Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to deliver to the United States Air Force Tactical Fuze production requirements for FY13 through FY17. It is anticipated that a single ID/IQ contract will be awarded for a period of five years (12 month base w/four 12 month ordering periods). The minimum FMU-153 A/B PD/Delay Fuze order expected in any one year will be approximately 5,500 fuzes up to a maximum quantity of 65,000 Fuzes over a 5 year period. <br>  <br> All Contractors shall provide their size standard in accordance with NAICS code 332993.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY <br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is conducting market research to support the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research requirement for one (1) Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) Detector Module to include installation and post&#8208;warranty maintenance.</p>
<p>This is a sources sought to determine the availability and capability of small business manufacturers or small businesses capable of supplying a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is&#8208; 334516 &#8208; Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Part I: General Information</p>
<p>A. Introduction</p>
<p>Characterization of bio-conjugated nanoparticles and detection/quantification of oligonucleotides/proteins/peptides are crucial for development of ultrasensitive viral pathogen diagnostic methods for and the research of blood borne pathogens and emerging diseases. Recently the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) acquired an Agilent 7100A Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) instrument equipped with an Agilent Ultraviolet-Diode Array Detector (UV-DAD) for use in this research work. The sensitivity of the UV-DAD detector is insufficient for identifying picomolar/femtomolar levels of samples. To further enhance the capability of the CE system, the FDA/CBER requires a Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) Detector.<br />B. Background</p>
<p>The CE technique provides ultrahigh resolution and great separation speed for a broad range of complex biological samples found in life sciences such as nucleic acids, peptides, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, pharmaceutical compounds, nanoparticles, viruses and cells. However, the sensitivity of the standard CE detector, UV-DAD, is insufficient for identifying samples with concentrations at or below picomolar levels, which greatly hinders efforts on the study of HIV, influenza and viruses from other emerging diseases, discovery of related biomarkers, and development of ultrasensitive diagnostic tools against the pathogens. A typical LIF detector, however, is up to 100,000 times more sensitive than UV detection. The significantly higher sensitivity of the LIF detector makes it highly desirable for sensitively and selectively detecting low-abundance analytes in complex biological matrixes, and thus greatly benefits the CE method development/validation, nanoparticle bio-conjugate characterization and general clinical research.</p>
<p>C. Scope</p>
<p>An ultrasensitive LIF detector is important to the CE study of pathogens and rapid identification of oligonucleotides, proteins, small compounds and nano/micrometer-sized particles. The LIF detector together with the existing Agilent 7100A CE system will be employed in the characterization of bio-conjugated nanoparticles, analysis of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) products and peptides/proteins/antibodies from HIV/influenza or other viruses, as well as the discovery of nucleic acid/peptide/protein biomarkers for diagnosis of blood borne pathogens in existing and emerging diseases.</p>
<p>Part II: Work Requirements<br /><br />A. Technical requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Capabilities: ultrasensitive fluorescence detection and quantification of fluorescent-dye-labeled or natively fluorescent proteins, nucleic acids (DNA/RNA), polysacchoarides, small compounds, virus/bacterial particles and nanomaterials.

<DESC>This is a Source Sought Notice only. This notice does NOT constitute a request for proposal, request for quotes, or invitation for bid. The intent of this notice is to identify potential offerors for market research purposes and to determine whether to set aside for small businesses.

Norfolk Naval Shipyard is specifically seeking Small Businesses (SB) with current relevant qualifications, experience, personnel and capabilities to perform the following requirement:

The Demineralizer Feedwater is a critical part of waterfront work on vessels being serviced by Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY). This demineralization process allows all impurities and minerals to be stripped from city water to allow it to be used onboard Navy vessels in the boiler and engine of the ship.
 As a result of the delicate nature of this operation, any water used for this process must be of the highest quality; therefore, these trailers must be monitored and tested daily to ensure that the water meets the specifications in the statement of work. See critical parts of specifications.

This requirement is for contractor services to provide feedwater and the portable rigs needed to transport, for use at Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY). Once these rigs are on site, they are connected to a supply line which is city water and the demineralizer system removes all harmful minerals and produces Grade A Water. An effluent (liquid waste) line is connected to the demineralizer rig and this feedwater is used as boiler water, flushes, in the engines and various other locations on the ship.
 NNSY requires these services to perform daily operations.

The proposed contractor will provide sufficient material, labor, equipment, supervision to fulfill all requirements of the contract.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 221310 with a size standard of $7.0 Million. This procurement will be awarded using the Simplified Acquisition Procedures 13.5. The Government anticipants a Firm-Fixed Price Contract. The anticipated award date is To Be Announced (TBA).

Location: Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Building 1500, 2nd Floor, Portsmouth, VA 23709-5000.

Period of Performance: TBA

IMPORTANT NOTICE:

Interested sources are invited to respond to this sources sought synopsis should email Contract Specialist, Anjune Ennis (Debraux) at anjune.debraux@navy.mil and Contracting Officer, Valerie Moore at valerie.moore@navy.mil no later than 24 January 2013 at 2:00 PM EST.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is seeking qualification statements from Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms for various A-E services in the states covered by EPA Region 5.  The states in the covered area are Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin. EPA intends to award one or more indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts under this acquisition.  Each contract is expected to have a five-year performance period, with a minimum order amount of $25,000.  The estimated value of a contract is $5 million.  Task orders are expected to typically range between $25,000 and $250,000, although some will likely be higher or lower.  Loaded hourly rates (inclusive of overhead and profit) for each major discipline will be negotiated for each contract year.  These loaded rates will serve as the basis for pricing task orders.
Task orders under each contract are expected to include the preparation of designs, plans, specifications, cost estimates, studies and reports, surveys, and construction phase services.  Projects may involve alterations, renovations and additions to research facilities and office buildings, including site and infrastructure.  The work will primarily involve government-owned property, but leased property may be included.  Work will be submitted in hard copy report format, hard copy D-size drawings, and/or CADD and other electronic formats.
The services required may include all major professional A-E disciplines, including architecture, electrical and mechanical engineering, structural engineering, civil engineering, landscape architecture, cost estimating, lab planning, space planning, and construction phase assistance.  Required disciplines will vary by project.  Additional information relative to specific EPA projects to be performed under any resulting contract(s) is not available at this time.
The required A-E services are being procured in accordance with the Brooks Architect-Engineer Selection Act (P.L. 92-582) as implemented by FAR 36.6 and EPAAR 1536.6.  Selection will be non-project specific. Firms will be selected for contract negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.
This procurement is a 100% set-aside for small business concerns.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330, ?Engineering Services?, and the relevant small business size standard is average annual receipts for the last three fiscal years not exceeding $14 million.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) Database prior to contract award (FAR 4.1102).

Interested persons with technical and logistical capabilities may contact the Contract Specialist via email only regarding this procurement and may identify capabilities for providing services of this kind. Contract Specialist: Suzanne Angelo, suzanne.angelo2@va.gov, no later than January 25, 2013 @1330 PT. Provided below is a draft (subject to revision) Statement of Work for the required services. Service Disabled and Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB and VOSB) contracting with VA are to self-register in VetBiz if seeking consideration under PL 109-461 (www.vetbiz.gov - Vendor Information Pages - VIP). All contractors are required to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) (www.sam.gov). Contractors should complete On-Line Representations and Certifications at this same site. Consult your State Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) for technical assistance with these requirements. (http://www.dla.mil/db/procurem.htm)

  Background.  
The RR&D Center has ongoing studies of the effect of prosthetic foot characteristics on intact limb forces associated with knee osteoarthritis that require assistance.

1.	This study will use a novel device to track foot bone motion in feet that are surgical candidates for foot reconstructive procedures. We aim to evaluate feet pre-surgery to explore subtle functional differences, and then again 1 year post-surgery to determine if the feet have been restored to normal. Feet come in a wide range of sizes and shapes, and often arch height (low or high) is the most common descriptor. Some feet which are nominally classified as low or high arched are actually just part of normal variation and are not of interest to this study. Rather, we aim to examine symptomatic (painful) feet that have aberrant shapes and are candidates for surgery. Pes planus (low arch) is the most common foot condition in Americans; treatment is not well-standardized and may involve conservative or surgical options. There is little agreement among surgeons as to which procedures to perform, but an important consideration is the presence of hindfoot valgus. Without this deformity, painful flatfeet can often be corrected with medial column procedures, but if hindfoot valgus is present, then a calcaneal osteotomy is required. Pes cavus (high arch) is also prevalent in the US and among patients seeking surgical remedy, there is a key separator that divides pes cavus patients into two subgroups; these feet are either flexible and forefoot driven, with a plantar flexed first metatarsal and a correctible hindfoot varus, or they are fixed, with a rigid deformity. The former is often correctible with soft tissue procedures, while the latter requires an osteotomy of the first metatarsal and/or the calcaneus. The general concept in all these cases is to restore the load path through the foot to the ground. Studying foot bone motion and plantar pressure is a direct means of evaluating this, both within foot type group pre-surgically and compared to neutrally aligned subjects post-surgically. While plantar pressure measurement technologies are well established, quantifying foot bone motion in vivo is a non-trivial task. Despite great strides in recent decades in motion capture and medical imaging, these techniques remain fraught with problems when applied to the foot. For instance, motion capture requires multiple markers on the same bone, which due to the many small and intricately shaped bones in the foot necessitates grouping bones together. The technique also suffers from soft tissue motion artifact. Other methods, such as computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have long scan times that preclude dynamic data collection. Until recently, the gold standards for motion analysis, including markers mounted via bone pins and dynamic radiostereometric analysis of tantalum beads, were highly invasive. Recently, biplane fluoroscopy has become an alternative to traditional retro-reflective systems or to the non-traditional but highly invasive systems. However, the foot provides some unique challenges to this technique, mostly due to the small, overlapping nature of the foot bones. Our group has developed a biplane fluoroscope system that is tailored to address the unique issues of the foot. Veterans, in particular older Veterans, are likely to suffer from foot problems such as pes planus, arthritis or diabetes related tissue changes, at a higher prevalence than the general population, and as such, they stand to benefit from the research that our group is proposing.


2.	The purpose of this study is to use our biplane fluoroscope to quantify foot bone motion of pes planus and pes cavus subjects pre- and post-surgery. We will compare and contrast these feet to a group of neutrally-aligned subjects to see how the pre- and post-surgical feet differ. Our Specific Aims are: [1] Refine our existing biplane fluoroscopy system. To decrease processing time, we will move from a central processing unit (CPU)-based to a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based software structure. We will also improve our calibration with enhanced three-dimensional (3D) localizer and distortion correction frames; [2] Compare the foot bone motion and plantar pressure of pes cavus, pes planus, and neutrally aligned subjects. Pre-surgically, we will study four groups of patients: 1) pes planus without hindfoot valgus, 2) pes planus with hindfoot valgus, 3) flexible pes cavus and 4) fixed pes cavus. We will study the same four groups 1-year post-surgery, as well as a control group of neutrally aligned patients.

<p>SYNOPSIS:<br />This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />The USCG HC-144 is a pressurized, twin-turboprop aircraft with a high cantilever wing and retractable tricycle undercarriage. It is powered by two General Electric CT7-9C3 turboprops which drive Hamilton Sundstrand 14RF-31 four-blade reverse-pitch propellers. The aircraft is specifically equipped to perform all USCG missions which include: search and rescue, maritime safety, security, logistics, as well as national defense and protection of natural resources. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the 160M042 Series IEDS is Hamilton Sundstrand, Windsor Locks, CT (Cage Code: 0YJV4).</p>
<p>USCG OBJECTIVES:<br />USCG, Aviation Logistics Center, Elizabeth City, North Carolina is seeking sources that can Repair/Overhaul/Upgrade of the Hamilton Sundstrand Air Cycle Machine (ACM) currently installed in the Coast Guard's HC-144A aircraft. Hamilton Sundstrand, Windsor Locks, CT, is the ACM's original manufacturer (OEM). ACMs are used for pressurization and cooling of the aircraft. In an effort to improve ACM reliability the Coast Guard is seeking sources with experience in the repair, and overhaul of part number (P/N) 782630-5 in accordance with (IAW) Component Maintenance Manual 21-51-48 Rev 7, dated Aug 07/07. In addition, the Coast Guard is seeking information from potential sources who can recommend improvements that will increase reliability of the unit ultimately lowering operational costs. Potential modifications may include replacement of the steel bearings (P/N M100HX76) with ceramic bearings or recommend the use of Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA) replacements. The USCG will not be able to provide manuals or drawings for this requirement.</p>
<p>PART NUMBER NOMENCLATURE</p>
<p>782630-5 Hamilton Sundstrand Air Cycle Machine (ACM)</p>
<p>REPLIES:<br />Responses to this notice should include company name, address, and telephone number, point of contact (POC) and provide the following additional information: (1) Evidence of certification as a FAA authorized repair center with experience in repair/overhaul of ACMs; (2) Demonstrate engineering expertise to design or recommend modifications; (3) Have access or the ability to obtain OEM specifications or provide sufficient technical data to ensure that a repaired/overhauled/modified ACM meets OEM specifications. The Coast Guard does not own nor can it provide OEM specifications; (4) Demonstrate ability to procure OEM replacement parts or provide technical specifications for Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA) replacements; (5) Demonstrate past performance information for the past two years for engineering changes and/or repair/overhaul for similar or like components and; (6) Possess a quality system which meets ISO 9001-2000 or one that is acceptable to the Coast Guard.</p>
<p>The Government considers the applicable NAICS code to be 336413-Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing. Respondents are requested to provide information the additional following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POCs and contract numbers? (9) If possible, provide POCs for civilian users for general usage of product questions.</p>
<p>After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the USCG still plans to proceed with an acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunity website. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis. Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the USCG to award any contract.</p>
<p>Responses to this sources sought notice shall e-mailed to John.R.Travers@uscg.mil. TELEPHONE RESPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award. All interested parties must respond to that potential future solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement.

<DESC>FEDBIZOPS  --  Special Notice The Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Regional Office, Columbia Cascades Area Office, Bend field Office (BFO) intends to negotiate one sole-source contract to control or manage noxious vegetation at Reclamation facilities within the Bend Field Office jurisdiction:  Rogue River Project (Agate, Emigrant, and Howard Prairie Lakes), Crooked River Project (Prineville Reservoir), and Deschutes Project (Wickiup, Crane Prairie and Haystack Reservoirs), through an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program.   One contract will be negotiated with Crook County, Oregon.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 926140, Agricultural pest & Weed Regulation, Govt., and the small business size standard is not applicable, Reclamation has determined under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, that the Crook County Weed Control possesses the unique qualifications for these services for Bureau of Reclamation lands in Oregon.  The unique source determination is based on the following: The nature of the required work is complex, continuous, and at a program management level.  Persons contracted for this work must understand Reclamation's mission and land management needs.  The Work involves considerably more than just spraying noxious weeds on Reclamation lands.  The supplies and services required by Reclamation through the BFO for operation of the IPM are: (1) technically uncommon and not widely available commercially (expertise in plant identification, herbicides, biological control agents, and the regulations which govern them, and state applicator certifications for field work);  (2) required to be implemented across a large geographic scale (across four counties spanning hundreds of miles and several very different physiographic provinces); (3) broad in scope (chemical, biological, and regulatory expertise) and require familiarity with the coordination needs and on-going efforts of county, state, and federal weed control personnel; (4) are not readily available from a private sector contractor.  To appeal to private sector contractors, the scope of work for Reclamation's IPM program would have to be significantly simplified, greatly reduced in geographic scope, and reduced in its expectation that Reclamation's IPM mission would be addressed.  The resulting contracts would be larger in overall number, smaller in dollar amounts, and more geographically and work specific.  Reclamation's IPM program extends significantly beyond weed spraying, and needs to be managed effectively within the larger context of the state and the region, and across local, state, and other federal jurisdictions.  To achieve consistency in IPM programs across all levels, a management partnership with state and county-level organizations is the most efficient alternative. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and award of this requirement will not be delayed to qualify a new contractor.  Firms believing they can provide the services listed above must provide written notification to the Contracting Officer with supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. All responses received within 15 days of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Inquiries will be accepted by electronic mail to jmathews@usbr.gov or fax 208/378-5108.

<DESC>Amendment to Posting of Jan 15, 2013 - The Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) are pleased to be co-hosting this vendor collaboration event. If you have already registered and received an e-mail confirmation, then you do not need to re-register. PLEASE NOTE: register at OMWI-Outreach@occ.treas.gov as discussed below. DO NOT CONTACT RHONDA TRENT.
<p>Vendor Collaboration Event - Top Teaming Tactics: What Primes Really Want</p>
<p>FREE EVENT IS OPEN TO ALL BUSINESSES. Businesses not registered PRIOR to the event will not be allowed to participate &#9472; NO WALK-INS.</p>
<p>The OCC and FHFA are co-hosting a vendor outreach event entitled Top Teaming Tactics: What Primes Really Want to provide technical assistance for small businesses and women and minority-owned businesses interested in entering or growing their contract opportunities with the Federal government.</p>
<p>The OCC charters, regulates, and supervises national banks and federal savings associations. The OCC's goal is to ensure federal financial institutions operate in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with laws requiring the fair treatment of customers and fair access to credit and financial products. The OCC's annual procurement expenditures are approximately $140 million, with the top spend categories primarily in the following North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes: 541519; 541611; 541513; 541310; 524210; 541512; and 518210.</p>
<p>The FHFA is an independent regulatory agency responsible for the oversight of the housing government-sponsored enterprises including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks. FHFA is also the conservator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These institutions play critical roles in supporting the nation's housing finance system. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantee mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and hold mortgages and MBS for investment. The Federal Home Loan Banks lend money to banks and other financial institutions using mortgages as collateral and also invest in mortgage-related assets. FHFA's mission is to ensure that these institutions operate in a safe and sound manner so that they serve as a reliable source of liquidity and funding for housing finance and community investment. The FHFA's annual procurement expenditures are approximately $55 million; with the top spend categories primarily in the following NAICS codes: 531120, 541110, 541611, 541511, 541513, and 423430.</p>
<p>Both OCC and FHFA utilize the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Schedules (Multiple Award Schedules) Program for many of their contracting needs.</p>
<p>The agenda for Top Teaming Tactics: What Primes Really Want includes: (1) what primes really want; (2) your "fit" checklist; (3) teaming types; (4) teaming agreements and beyond; and (5) the meeting and briefing toolkit. Attendees will also participate in a structured networking session with representatives from other businesses.</p>

<DESC>The Government intends to issue a modification action for the extension of contract period from March 3, 2013 to September 3, 2013 of the Griswold dba ClaVal Co contract SPM76003D9701.&nbsp; This project was initiated to afford additional coverage while DLA works on the successor project.&nbsp; The contract is a long term contract currently in its 10th and final year.&nbsp; Griswold dba ClaVal Co is the only approved source of supply for&nbsp;all NSNs.&nbsp; Primary point of contact is Laurie Baisden at <a href="mailto:laurie.baisden@dla.mil">laurie.baisden@dla.mil</a>.&nbsp; Items will be procured on an "all or none" basis per NSN.&nbsp; All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.&nbsp; One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979.&nbsp; All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars.&nbsp; All interested suppliers may submit an offer.&nbsp; The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or sumit proposals.&nbsp; This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.&nbsp; However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date ofpublication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.&nbsp; a determination by the government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.&nbsp; Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />This acquisition is for the supplies for which the government does not possess the complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore the government intends to solicit and contract with the only aproved source under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).&nbsp; Griswold dba ClaVal Co (86184) is the sole approved source.&nbsp; While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors described in the solicitation.&nbsp; All terms and conditions as indicated in the contract remain for the specified extension period.&nbsp; NSNs to be covered under this project include:<br /><br />

<DESC>All interested parties are invited to participate in an Engineering and Technical Related Services (ETRS) Industry Day to be held on 12 February 2013 from 9:30 am to 1:00pm at The Cannon Gate Conference Center at Picatinny Arsenal in Dover, NJ (07806-5000).  Government attendees will include representatives from the Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head Divisions (NSWC IHD) - Picatinny Detachment, Systems Integration Department and the NSWC IHD Procurement Office.  

This acquisition is anticipated to provide services in direct support of the NSWC IHD Picatinny Detachments primary mission of providing In-Service Support to Major, Medium and Minor Caliber Gun Systems operated by the US Navy.
  The objective of this event is to provide an opportunity for early industry involvement in the Government's proposed approach for future procurement of the ETRS requirement.  The ETRS requirement will provide engineering and technical related support services in the following key areas: 1) Weapon Systems Engineering, Technology, Engineering and Logistics, 2) Technical Systems Engineering Analysis and Basic Engineering Studies of Weapon Systems and Performance, 3)Engineering Studies Necessary to support new concepts, designs, and programs to support acquisition life cycle,  4) Technical Services such as technical documents, drafting, illustrations, etc., 5) Development and Execution of overall contract and management plan to include metrics measuring contractor performance against proposal expectations, 6) Furnishing data item deliverables, as well as performance management plan and surveillance tools for the government to use in monitoring the contract.
  

Following this Industry Day, it is envisioned that a Request For Proposal (RFP) will be issued for the ETRS requirement.  The contracting approach will involve the issue of an RFP followed by proposal submission by all interested vendors.  This will ultimately lead to a contract award.  

After an evaluation involving NSWC IHD Picatinny Detachment Systems Integration Department personnel, one proposal will be selected for further acquisition. Input received from this Industry Day will facilitate refinement of the competitive acquisition strategy. Industry input is desired to allow for an effective acquisition program with well-defined requirements in the Request for Proposal (RFP). 

Attendees are requested to register for the Industry Day event by completing the attached Picatinny Arsenal Registration Form and submitting it to Patricia Gorski at patricia.gorski@navy.mil and Cc edward.rogan@navy.mil by 31 January 2013.
 

For contractual issues please contact Eddie Rogan at edward.rogan@navy.mil.  The Industry Day agenda as well as technical information regarding the ETRS requirement will be available on FedBizOpps beginning on 22 January 2013.  Questions regarding the technical information are encouraged after 22 January 2013.  All questions submitted on or before 31 January 2013 will be answered not later than 07 February 2013.  Questions submitted after that date will be answered during the Industry Day.  Questions should be submitted to Hany Lansing at hany.lansing@navy.mil and Eddie Rogan at edward.rogan@navy.mil.  Attendees will have the opportunity to ask questions during the Industry Day.  All questions and answers will be posted after Industry Day.

Attendance at the ETRS Industry Day is not a prerequisite for ultimately submitting any future proposals, however, it will provide a valuable opportunity for questions, answers, and industry input.
  All briefs and discussions will remain at the unclassified level.  Industry Day is solely to offer interested parties early involvement in the Government's proposed approach for future procurement of the ETRS requirement. This announcement is for informational purposes only, does not constitute an invitation for bid or Request for Proposal, and is not construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a contract or order.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information obtained during the workshop or for the time and expense of the industry participants involved, nor is the Government obligated to any future acquisition or procurement action. Furthermore, the Government will not pay for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement nor will the government return any data provided.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans District intends to Sole Source an award for the New Orleans District's Interim Closure Structures (ICS), Preventive Maintenance,  Repairs, Upgrades  and Certification Responsibilities of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) System at the Outfall Canals (Orleans Avenue, London Avenue, and 17th Street Canals),  by issuing a new IDIQ contract that will consist of a base year and 4 optional periods of performance at the Interim Closure Structures (ICS) to replace the current contract with Prime Control (W912P8-09-D-0023) that is expiring .  The New Orleans District's Interim Closure Structures (ICS) was developed and constructed over successive phases to provide flood risk management protection for the New Orleans metropolitan area. Over past years and through the direct efforts of the current maintenance contractor, Prime Controls, the ICS SCADA system has inevitably evolved into a unique, complex system having a large set of design changes crafted to meet system monitoring, control and security requirements.   This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  A determination not to compete this proposed effort as Full and Open competition is solely at the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice nor will a Request for Proposal be issued based upon this Notice of Intent.

<DESC>Sole Source Notice of Intent<br><br>The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers - Information Technology (ACE-IT) Most Efficient Organization (MEO) intends to solicit on a sole source basis to Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems, Inc., 6801 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20817-1803 for classified and unclassified Information Management and Information Technology (IM/IT) support services.  This sole source falls under the Justification and Approval (J&A) for an extension of the current contract, W91WMC-07-D-0001.  Period of performance for continuation of services will be from 1 October 2013 thru 30 September 2014.<br><br>Lockheed Martin is a long time collaborator with ACE-IT.  As the primary contractor for W91WMC-07-D-0001, Lockheed Martin is responsible for overseeing IM/IT support services as directed at supporting USACE locations within the continental United States (CONUS), Pacific Ocean Division, Honolulu District, Alaska District, and Puerto Rico totaling approximately 41,000+ end-users.

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>(i) Technical capability of the items/services offered to meet or exceed the Government's requirement.<br />(ii) Past Performance<br />(iii) Price.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important when compared to price in determining the best value to the government. If the PAG determines that competing technical proposals are essentially equal, the price factor becomes increasingly important and may become the determining factor in the source selection decision.</p>
<p>Technical capability will be determined by review of information submitted by the offeror which must provide a description in sufficient detail to show that the offeror has the capability to perform the required services which demonstrates the technical approach and understanding to meet the Government's requirement. The response should include who, what, when and how the requirement will be accomplished. Such documentation should include technician certification from the original equipment manufacturer within the past calendar year.</p>
<p>Past Performance<br />Past Performance will be determined by review of recent Government Contracts.

Contractors shall include the firm's DUNS number with quote.</p>
<p>Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options (FAR 52.217-8 and 52.217-9) to the total price for the base requirement. For evaluation purposes, the Government will apply &frac12; of the Option Year 3 pricing in its evaluation of the 52.217-8 option pricing which, for evaluation purposes, would occur following the conclusion of Option Year 3. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Offerors are afforded the opportunity to inspect the system prior to the date set for receipt of quotes by contacting the Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer identified herein to schedule an appointment. Failure to inspect the system will not relieve the successful offeror from fully meeting the requirements of the resulting contract at the price offered.</p>

<DESC><p>Description: NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE</p>
<p>The Department of Treasury intends to issue a Firm-Fixed Price, Sole Source Contract to Infinite Software Resources (ISR) under the authority of FAR 12.603 and 13.106-1(b)(1), Only One Responsible Source.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for one (1) experienced administrative position to provide administrative support to a Federal Employee who requires such assistant on a regular basis. This is an immediate need for an employee who has been granted reasonable accommodation by the supporting Office of Human Resources. The period of performance will be for approximately 240 days. Further delay in not providing this accommodation could violate the Rehabilitation Act and further delay providing this service and places the agency at risk. Due to the time sensitive nature of this requirement, full and open competition would delay the efforts that have already been achieved and would equate to duplication of time and money.</p>
<p>A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. This notice is neither a request for proposal/quote nor a solicitation for offers. All questions pertaining to this notice must be in writing and emailed to Contracting Officer, Truline Rodgers at Truline.l.rodgers@irs.gov by 8:00am on January 22, 2013. Response to this notice is not required.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotations (RFQ) NIH-NLM-2012-427/SRE. The resultant order will be a firm-fixed price purchase order.
<p>In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to procure professional services to assist in its goal to provide order fulfillment for the NLM in all components of its InformationRx outreach program.This acquisition is a 100% total small business set aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561431-Private Mail Centers with a small business size standard of $7.0 million.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The Outreach Initiative charged to the National Library of Medicine (NLM) by the Board of Regents is to raise public awareness about the services and programs of the NLM. In furtherance of that mission, the NLM developed the "Information Prescription Project," a free outreach program offered by the NLM to physicians and health professionals to refer their patients to MedlinePlus.gov - a trusted and reliable consumer health information resource. The goal is to have MedlinePlus be the website your doctor prescribes. This national health information resource outreach program was launched in 2004 as a collaborative effort between the NLM and the American College of Physicians (ACP) Foundation as one possible answer to the health literacy challenge that affects nearly half of all American adults. Since its launch in 2004, the NLM has expanded its collaborative effort to include the American Osteopathic Association, the National Medical Association, and the American Association of Physician Assistants.</p>
<p>Purpose/Objective:<br />Physicians and health professionals can use InformationRx health information outreach resources to direct their patients to MedlinePlus content, in English or Spanish. The physician's objective may be to help a patient prevent a debilitating illness, understand a new diagnosis, become comfortable with a new treatment plan, or simply learn to better manage a chronic condition. Participating physicians tell NLM that an information prescription helps improve patient communication, encourages compliance, and reduces the number of poor quality internet searches that patients sometimes do on their own. In other words, the InformationRx project can save valuable time, empower patients, and enhance the quality and outcome of an interaction - during an office visit and after a patient returns home. The InformationRx program is a rigorous outreach and evaluation project that seeks to increase pubic and health professional awareness of NLM services and programs.</p>
<p>To accomplish the identified objectives, the NLM is seeking the services of a Contractor to assist in its goal to provide order fulfillment for the NLM in all components of its InformationRx outreach program.</p>
<p>Tasks/Deliverables:<br />Specifically, the Contractor shall:</p>
<p>&#9679; Be the fulfillment house for a variety of different Information Rx health information outreach resource materials and shall coordinate inventory with the NLM<br />&#9679; Receive data daily from web shopping cart page attached to www.informationrx.org<br />website<br />&#9679; Receive fax orders from customers on the Contractor-provided toll free fax number (data to include name and ship to address, product, order quantity); and NLM will have access to inventory and order information through the Contractor's Pro-Mail software<br />&#9679; Enter manual orders into the fulfillment system as needed as a data entry cost. Order fulfillment shall include generation of package label/packing slip to include distribution center information; pick, pack and ship product<br />&#9679; Provide and host a website, www.informationrx.org, for interested partners to place orders. The Contractor shall fulfill website orders and provide account management and promail access. There will be no sharing of the data collected with anyone other than the National Library of Medicine.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:<br />The period of performance will be twelve (12) months from date of award, with four (4) additional 12-month option periods.</p>
<p>Payment:<br />Partial payments will be made. Monthly invoices are required.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria<br />Technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the purchase order; however, price is also important to the overall award decision. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The Government can make tradeoffs among pric and technical factors in determining which Quoter offers the best value by awarding to other than the lowest price Quoter or other than the highest technically rated Quoter. Quoters are advised that award will be made to that Quoter whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>In determining which quote represents the best value and results in the lowest overall price alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs, the Government shall evaluate quotes using the following technical evaluation criteria, which are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation processes:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>The following technical evaluation criteria below are listed in relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes.</p>

<p>2. Personnel/Staff Qualifications (25 Points)</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrated qualifications, experience and availability of all proposed personnel, including any consultants and/or subcontractors, and evidence of relevant past work. <br />&bull; Provide resumes of all proposed project personnel that document previous pertinent experience and references<br />&bull; Evidence that proposed team can accomplish tasks in specified timeframe.</p>
<p>3. Organizational Capabilities, Experience and Commitment (25 Points)</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(d) Any unauthorized deviation in the Production Schedule which results in a delay in the completion of work on a vessel past the established performance period completion date may entitle the Government to remedies for late performance, including, but not limited to, liquidated damages.</p>
<p>1352.271-75 Delivery and Shifting of the Vessel (Apr 2010)<br />(a) The Government shall deliver the vessel to the contractor, at the location specified in the contract.</p>

However, the contractor shall not be responsible for any such loss or damage discovered after redelivery of the vessel unless the loss or damage is discovered within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel and loss or damage is affirmatively shown to be the result of the fault or negligence of the contractor. To induce the contractor to perform the work for the compensation provided, it is specifically agreed that the contractor's aggregate liability on account of loss of or damage to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and Government-owned materials and equipment, shall in no event exceed the sum of $1,000,000.00. As to the contractor, the Government assumes the risk of loss or damage to the Government-owned vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and said Government-owned materials and equipment in excess of $1,000,000.00. This assumption of risk includes but is not limited to loss or damage from negligence of whatsoever degree of the contractor's servants, employees, agents or subcontractors, but specifically excludes loss or damage from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of contractor's personnel, who have supervision or direction of all or substantially all of the contractor's business, or all or substantial all of the contractor's operation at any one plant. However, as to such risk assumed and borne by the Government, the Government shall be subrogated to any claim, demand or cause of action against third persons which exists in favor of the contractor, and the contractor shall, if required, execute a formal assignment or transfer of claims, demands or causes of action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall create or give rise to any right, privilege or power in any person except the contractor, nor shall any person (except the contractor) be or become entitled thereby to proceed directly against the Government, or join the Government as a co-defendant in any action against the contractor brought to determine the contractor's liability, or for any other purpose.</p>
<p>(c) The contractor indemnifies and holds harmless the Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, and the vessel against all suits, actions, claims, costs or demands (including without limitation, suits, actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury and property damage) to which the Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, or the vessel may be subject or put by reason of damage or injury (including death) to the property or person of anyone other than the Government, its agencies, instrumentalities and personnel, or the vessel, arising or resulting in whole or in part from the fault, negligence, wrongful act or wrongful omission of the contractor, or any subcontractor, its or their servants, agents or employees; provided that the contractor's obligation to indemnify under this paragraph (c) shall not exceed the sum of $1,000,000.00 on account of any one accident or occurrence in respect of any one vessel. Such indemnity shall include, without limitation, suits, actions, claims, costs or demands of any kind whatsoever, resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring during the period of performance of work on the vessel or within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel. Any new equipment warranties that extend beyond the 90 days after redelivery of the vessel shall be assigned to the Government upon redelivery of the vessel. With respect to any such suits, actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring after the expiration of such period, the rights and liabilities of the Government and the contractor shall be as determined by other provisions of this contract and by law; provided that such indemnity shall apply to death occurring after such period which results from any personal injury received during the period covered by the contractor's indemnity as provided herein.</p>
<p>(d) The contractor shall, at its own expense, procure, and thereafter maintain such casualty, accident and liability insurance, in such forms and amounts as may be approved by the Contracting Officer, insuring the performance of its obligations under paragraph (c) of this clause. In addition, the contractor shall at its own expense procure and thereafter maintain such ship repairer's legal liability insurance as may be necessary to insure the contractor against its liability as ship repairer in the amount of $1,000,000.00, or the value of the vessel as determined by the Contracting Officer, whichever is the lesser, with respect to each vessel on which work is performed. The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies, However, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, such insurance need not be procured whenever the job order requires work on parts of a vessel only and the work is to be performed at a plant other than the site of the vessel. Further, the contractor shall procure and maintain in force Worker's Compensation Insurance (or its equivalent) covering its employees engaged in the work and shall ensure the procurement and maintenance of such insurance by all subcontractors engaged in the work. The contractor shall provide evidence of insurance as required by the Government.</p>
<p>(e) The contractor shall receive no allowance in the contract price for inclusion of any premium expense or charge for any reserve made on account of self-insurance for coverage against any risk assumed by the Government under this clause.</p>
<p>(f) As soon as practicable after the occurrence of any loss or damage, the risk of which the Government has assumed, written notice of the damage shall be given by the contractor to the Contracting Officer.

If claim is made or suit is brought thereafter against the contractor as the result or because of such event, the contractor shall immediately deliver to the Government every demand, notice, summons or other process received by it or its representatives. The contractor shall cooperate with the Government, and, upon the Government's request, shall assist in effecting settlements, securing and giving evidence; obtaining the attendance of witnesses, and other assistance required in the conduct of suits.

All such personnel shall comply with contractor rules and regulations governing personnel at its shipyard, including those regarding safety and security.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor further agrees to allow a reasonable number of officers, employees, and designated personnel of offerors on other contemplated work, the same privileges of admission to the contractor's facility and access to the vessel(s) on a noninterference basis, subject to contractor rules and regulations governing personnel in its shipyard, including those regarding safety and security.</p>

However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(e) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ___ Are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ___ Are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

EVALUATION  COMMERCIAL ITEMS (FAR 52.212-2) (JAN 1999)

The Government will award a single firm-fixed priced purchase order resulting from this solicitation/synopsis to the responsible quoter, whose submission conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.
 Price and past performance are the evaluation factors. The technical factor is past performance. 

The quoters Past Performance represents the Technical Submission. The technical evaluation will consider the quoters technical submission more important than the quoters price submission.

One copy of the Technical submission (Volume I) and one copy of the Price Submission (Volume II) are requested to be submitted in separate volumes. 

Note:  each page of each copy of the Technical Submission and Price Submission shall be affixed with the following legend:

	SOURCE SELECTION INFORMATION  SEE FAR 2.101 AND 3.104




Volume I  Technical Submission
Part 1 of 2

The quoter shall demonstrate relevant past performance or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past performance.
 Relevant past performance is performance under contracts or efforts (within the past five years) that is of the same or similar scope, of the same or similar magnitude, and of the same or similar complexity to that which is described in the solicitation.

Quoters who present same or similar contracts should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts to the requirements of the solicitation. The quoter should provide the following information regarding its past performance:

	1. Contract number(s),
	2. Name and phone number of a point of contact at the federal, state, local government or 	     	    	commercial entity for which the contract was performed,
	3.
 Dollar value of the contract,
	4. Period of Performance,
	5. The number of Interns provided,
	6. Detailed description of the work performed,

To demonstrate its past performance, the quoter shall identify three (3) of its most relevant contract or efforts within the past five (5) years, and provide any other information the quoter considers relevant to the requirements of the solicitation. Quoters should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts or efforts to the requirements of the solicitation. The references will be evaluated in the aggregate in order to allow quoters who may not have the entire scope, magnitude, and complexity of the requirement under one individual contract to still be considered acceptable if experience with the full scope, magnitude, and complexity of the requirement can be demonstrated within the allotted number of references as described above.


Note: The Government reserves the right to obtain information for the use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.
 Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. However, the submission of an quoter with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous submission to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful offer when compared to the submission of other quoters. The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance. If an quoter fails to provide any past performance information which  is similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity to that which is detailed in the solicitation or fails to affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance, the offer may not be awardable.
 The Government will consider the quality of the quoter's past performance. This consideration is separate and distinct from the Contracting Officers responsibility determination. The assessment of the quoters past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the quoter and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the solicitation. In determining the rating for the past performance evaluation factor, the Government will give greater consideration to contracts which the Government feels are most relevant to the solicitation.

If the submission is determined unacceptable in the Past Performance factor, the submission may not be considered for award.
  The Government reserves the right to award the purchase order to other than the lowest priced quoter.

Volume I  Technical Submission
Part 2 of 2

For Technical Approach, the quoter shall describe their proposed plan to recruit and identify the interns, get security clearances, and arrange housing and transportation.


Limitations:

This volume (parts 1 and 2 inclusive) is limited to a maximum of TWENTY (20) PAGES in length inclusive of any chart(s), diagram(s), and/or graphics(s). Each page is defined as one sheet, 8 x 11, with one inch or greater margins on all sides, using a font with a point size of 12 or greater (e.g. Times New Roman style with 12 point font).  Lines should, at a minimum, be single-spaced.
 Pages shall be consecutively numbered. Multiple pages, double pages, and  two-sided pages,  will count as an equivalent number of 8 x 11 pages. Pages submitted in excess of the above limit will NOT be evaluated but will be returned to the quoter.






Volume II  Price Submission

Volume II shall include the completed solicitation and a complete and detailed cost breakdown with all supporting documentation. The price proposal shall support the technical proposal. If the price proposal does not support the technical proposal, the quoters proposal rating may be downgraded. The price proposal shall include all elements of cost/price and such other cost information as considered appropriate to support the quoters quote.
 

Spreadsheets should be functional spreadsheets containing all necessary formulas (i.e., not read-only spreadsheet). Spreadsheets should not be locked or password protected.

<p>FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999) is as supplemented below:</p>
<p>This is a best value acquisition using the trade-off approach. The USCG intends to award a single Firm Fixed Price IDIQ Contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer is most advantageous to the Government.<br />Selection and award of a Firm Fixed Price IDIQ Contract will be based on, in descending order of importance, 1) Technical Approach and Capability, 2) Relevant Past Performance, and 3) Price. Technical Approach and Capability is considered to be more important than Past Performance; however when combined they are significantly more important than price. As the Technical and Management Approach and Relevant Past Performance ratings converge, price may become more important.</p>
<p>The USCG will evaluate the offers that meet the requirements of the solicitation against the following evaluation criteria: <br />Factor 1 - Technical Approach &amp; Capability: The Government will evaluate each offeror's technical approach to determine their capacity to meet all the requirements outlined in the PWS this will include the evaluation of the understanding of the PWS, an evaluation of the course descriptions and outlines, course facilities, training aids, and the resumes' of personnel designated Key IAW HSAR 3052.215-70</p>
<p>Factor 2- Relevant Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the past performance of the offeror for relevancy. The offeror shall provide past performance information for services directly related and relevant to the services to be performed under the PWS. To be considered relevant, the services must have been performed within the past three years. The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information other than the information submitted with the proposals received in conducting the evaluation. A Contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, but will receive a neutral rating. The USCG may consider past performance information regarding predecessor companies or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is considered relevant.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price: The offeror shall propose pricing for all courses. The offeror shall include their course cancellation policy, if any. Cancellation policies will be evaluated based on the government canceling one of each course per contract year 30 days before course convening, and one of each course per contract year 15 days before course convening. The Government will evaluate the total overall price based on the maximum estimated quantity of courses and the cancellation ceiling to determine price reasonableness.<br />FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (Nov 2012)<br />FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Feb 2012)<br />FAR 52.212-5 -- Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items (Nov 2012)</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justification for Other Than Full And Open Competition</p>
<p><br />1. Agency and contracting activity:</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN).</p>
<p>2. Nature/description of the action being approved:</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard C3CEN Electronics Repair Facility (ERF) has a requirement, on a sole source basis, for the purchase of electronic repair and replacement parts to be used in centralized depot repair of U.S. Coast Guard Electronic Equipment, specifically the Short Range Aid to Navigation (SRAN) High Wattage Power Supply (HWPS). The Coast Guard needs to repair these HWPS as they become unserviceable.</p>
<p>3. Description of supplies/services:</p>
<p>A Purchase Request will be issued for the purchase of 16 each 1A1 Circuit Board Assemblies (CBA's) manufactured by Delta Integration, Inc., the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). The parts requested are exact replacements to be used in the repair of the SRAN HWPS.</p>
<p>Total Estimated Value: $10, 500.00</p>
<p>4. Identification of the justification and the rationale:</p>
<p>This statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) implemented by FAR Subpart 6.302-1, entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".</p>
<p>5. Demonstration that the nature of the acquisition requires use of authority cited:</p>
<p>The OEM specifications for these items are proprietary commercial property. The Coast Guard did not purchase this information when the SRAN HWPS were originally purchased. Delta Integration, Inc. originally manufactured the components contained in the SRAN HWPS. Adequate item information, documentation, and specifications are not available to develop an appropriate purchase description for full and open competition. Delta Integration, Inc. is the only known manufacturer meeting system requirements for form, fit, function, configuration, records, and integration with the SRAN HWPS repair/replacement parts. Any variances would have a negative impact by preventing these SRAN High Wattage Power Supplies from functioning, which would adversely impact Short Range Navigation Equipment powered by the HWPS, which reduces safety and mission performance.<br />6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:</p>
<p>A Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be posted on FedBizOps with the statement Any Contractors that are authorized Distributors of Delta Integration Inc. is encouraged to provide a Firm Fixed Price<br />.<br />7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable:</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will determine price fair and reasonableness based on previous purchases of the same or similar items IAW FAR 13.106-3.</p>
<p>8. Description of Market Research:</p>
<p>Market research as prescribed in FAR Part 10 was conducted by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. The Internet was searched using part numbers and item names for a list of manufacturers/vendors that could provide SRAN HWPS replacement parts. The market research showed that only Delta Integration, Inc. replacement parts could meet the minimum technical specifications to ensure compatibility with existing electronic and mechanical circuitry and to ensure that safe operational parameters are maintained.</p>
<p>9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:</p>
<p>The material, technical specifications and supplementary data are proprietary to the OEM and cannot be provided to other manufacturers, which eliminates any opportunities for full and open competition. High Wattage Power Supplies are basic, however, a vital requirement for conducting safe navigation. Without Delta Integration, Inc. specific repair/replacement parts for these SRAN High Wattage Power Supplies, the Coast Guard would have to recapitalize new acquisitions for the entire Coast Guard fleet. The SRAN HWPS is the DC Power Supply used for all SRAN equipment (to include Fog Horns, Signal Lights, RACONs, Fog Detectors, etc.) and is used in most navigable shipping channels serviced by the Coast Guard. The estimated cost for replacing every HWPS in the fleet, while maintaining performance and technical standards, is cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>10. Listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:</p>
<p>None at this time.</p>
<p>11. Statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisitions for supplies or services required:</p>
<p>None at this time. <br />12. Contracting Officer's Certification:</p>
<p>I certify that this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p>James A. Lassiter <br />Contracting Officer</p>
<p>13. Evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel.</p>
<p>I certify this procurement meets the Government's minimum need and the supporting data which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>Anthony S. Kritsings<br />Technical Representative</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695

1.	Title of Project:  Amputation System of Care Training Materials

Scope of Work:  The contractor shall provide all manpower, resources and materials necessary to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), through the Employee Education System (EES), subscription for "Amputation System of Care" (ACA) training supplies, educational materials, and one year of ACA & "Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities" (CARF) corporate membership for 22 Veteran Integrated Service Networks (VISN) across the United States.  

3.0  Background:   VHA has experienced over the past decade an huge influx of amputee patients and a congruent amount of designated healthcare providers that care for these patients into the VHA healthcare system.  In order to support the healthcare providers and patients alike, ACA magazines/materials outline experience in providing the required educational training/support materials.  Also, the approaches outlined in the magazine will enable VHA to move from a 'disease model' of care into a patient centered 'wellness model'. This approach is also critical in order to provide better amputation care to VHA's foreseeable influx of amputee veterans seeking VHA healthcare.  The system that is incorporated in ACA's materials will place VA in a unique position of being the best approach to assist VA and its patients in improved "amputation of care".

In addition, VHA requires annual ACA/CARF membership for 22 VISN as well as 7 Regional Amputation Centers (RACs) and 15 Polytrauma Amputation Networks (PANS).   EES requires access to ACA/CARF corporate membership in order to support VHA's ongoing research for clinical training and education management decisions that directly impacts our nation's veterans quality of healthcare.  
4.0   Period of Performance:  The period of performance shall be for one year from the date of contract award.  In addition the government requests four (4) additional one (1) year option years.   
4.1.  Government Recognized Holidays.  Unless specifically authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer, no services will be provided and no charges will be incurred and/or billed to any order on this contract on any of the Federal Holidays listed below.	
       New Years Day			     Labor Day

	Presidents' Day	Veterans' Day
	Memorial Day	Thanksgiving Day
	Independence Day	Christmas Day

6.0 Type of Contract:  The Government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed-Price contract.
7.0  Contract Pre-Performance Meetings:  The contractor shall participate in regularly scheduled planning teleconference meetings throughout the performance of the contract.

If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.

Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PAST PERFORMANCE #2: PRICE #3: DELIVERY. PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ??6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ??6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC><strong>AMENDMENT #1: This amendment is to provide the Response to Vendor Inquiries.<br /><br /></strong><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotations (RFQ) NIH-NLM-2012-427/SRE. The resultant order will be a firm-fixed price purchase order.
<p>In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to procure professional services to assist in its goal to provide order fulfillment for the NLM in all components of its InformationRx outreach program.This acquisition is a 100% total small business set aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561431-Private Mail Centers with a small business size standard of $7.0 million.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The Outreach Initiative charged to the National Library of Medicine (NLM) by the Board of Regents is to raise public awareness about the services and programs of the NLM. In furtherance of that mission, the NLM developed the "Information Prescription Project," a free outreach program offered by the NLM to physicians and health professionals to refer their patients to MedlinePlus.gov - a trusted and reliable consumer health information resource. The goal is to have MedlinePlus be the website your doctor prescribes. This national health information resource outreach program was launched in 2004 as a collaborative effort between the NLM and the American College of Physicians (ACP) Foundation as one possible answer to the health literacy challenge that affects nearly half of all American adults. Since its launch in 2004, the NLM has expanded its collaborative effort to include the American Osteopathic Association, the National Medical Association, and the American Association of Physician Assistants.</p>
<p>Purpose/Objective:<br />Physicians and health professionals can use InformationRx health information outreach resources to direct their patients to MedlinePlus content, in English or Spanish. The physician's objective may be to help a patient prevent a debilitating illness, understand a new diagnosis, become comfortable with a new treatment plan, or simply learn to better manage a chronic condition. Participating physicians tell NLM that an information prescription helps improve patient communication, encourages compliance, and reduces the number of poor quality internet searches that patients sometimes do on their own. In other words, the InformationRx project can save valuable time, empower patients, and enhance the quality and outcome of an interaction - during an office visit and after a patient returns home. The InformationRx program is a rigorous outreach and evaluation project that seeks to increase pubic and health professional awareness of NLM services and programs.</p>
<p>To accomplish the identified objectives, the NLM is seeking the services of a Contractor to assist in its goal to provide order fulfillment for the NLM in all components of its InformationRx outreach program.</p>
<p>Tasks/Deliverables:<br />Specifically, the Contractor shall:</p>
<p>&#9679; Be the fulfillment house for a variety of different Information Rx health information outreach resource materials and shall coordinate inventory with the NLM<br />&#9679; Receive data daily from web shopping cart page attached to www.informationrx.org<br />website<br />&#9679; Receive fax orders from customers on the Contractor-provided toll free fax number (data to include name and ship to address, product, order quantity); and NLM will have access to inventory and order information through the Contractor's Pro-Mail software<br />&#9679; Enter manual orders into the fulfillment system as needed as a data entry cost. Order fulfillment shall include generation of package label/packing slip to include distribution center information; pick, pack and ship product<br />&#9679; Provide and host a website, www.informationrx.org, for interested partners to place orders. The Contractor shall fulfill website orders and provide account management and promail access. There will be no sharing of the data collected with anyone other than the National Library of Medicine.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:<br />The period of performance will be twelve (12) months from date of award, with four (4) additional 12-month option periods.</p>
<p>Payment:<br />Partial payments will be made. Monthly invoices are required.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria<br />Technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the purchase order; however, price is also important to the overall award decision. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The Government can make tradeoffs among pric and technical factors in determining which Quoter offers the best value by awarding to other than the lowest price Quoter or other than the highest technically rated Quoter. Quoters are advised that award will be made to that Quoter whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>In determining which quote represents the best value and results in the lowest overall price alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs, the Government shall evaluate quotes using the following technical evaluation criteria, which are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation processes:</p>

<DESC><strong>AMENDMENT #2: This amendment is to provide additional Responses to Vendor Inquiries.<br /><br /><br />AMENDMENT #1: This amendment is to provide the Response to Vendor Inquiries.<br /><br /></strong><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotations (RFQ) NIH-NLM-2012-427/SRE. The resultant order will be a firm-fixed price purchase order.
<p>In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to procure professional services to assist in its goal to provide order fulfillment for the NLM in all components of its InformationRx outreach program.This acquisition is a 100% total small business set aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561431-Private Mail Centers with a small business size standard of $7.0 million.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The Outreach Initiative charged to the National Library of Medicine (NLM) by the Board of Regents is to raise public awareness about the services and programs of the NLM. In furtherance of that mission, the NLM developed the "Information Prescription Project," a free outreach program offered by the NLM to physicians and health professionals to refer their patients to MedlinePlus.gov - a trusted and reliable consumer health information resource. The goal is to have MedlinePlus be the website your doctor prescribes. This national health information resource outreach program was launched in 2004 as a collaborative effort between the NLM and the American College of Physicians (ACP) Foundation as one possible answer to the health literacy challenge that affects nearly half of all American adults. Since its launch in 2004, the NLM has expanded its collaborative effort to include the American Osteopathic Association, the National Medical Association, and the American Association of Physician Assistants.</p>
<p>Purpose/Objective:<br />Physicians and health professionals can use InformationRx health information outreach resources to direct their patients to MedlinePlus content, in English or Spanish. The physician's objective may be to help a patient prevent a debilitating illness, understand a new diagnosis, become comfortable with a new treatment plan, or simply learn to better manage a chronic condition. Participating physicians tell NLM that an information prescription helps improve patient communication, encourages compliance, and reduces the number of poor quality internet searches that patients sometimes do on their own. In other words, the InformationRx project can save valuable time, empower patients, and enhance the quality and outcome of an interaction - during an office visit and after a patient returns home. The InformationRx program is a rigorous outreach and evaluation project that seeks to increase pubic and health professional awareness of NLM services and programs.</p>
<p>To accomplish the identified objectives, the NLM is seeking the services of a Contractor to assist in its goal to provide order fulfillment for the NLM in all components of its InformationRx outreach program.</p>
<p>Tasks/Deliverables:<br />Specifically, the Contractor shall:</p>
<p>&#9679; Be the fulfillment house for a variety of different Information Rx health information outreach resource materials and shall coordinate inventory with the NLM<br />&#9679; Receive data daily from web shopping cart page attached to www.informationrx.org<br />website<br />&#9679; Receive fax orders from customers on the Contractor-provided toll free fax number (data to include name and ship to address, product, order quantity); and NLM will have access to inventory and order information through the Contractor's Pro-Mail software<br />&#9679; Enter manual orders into the fulfillment system as needed as a data entry cost. Order fulfillment shall include generation of package label/packing slip to include distribution center information; pick, pack and ship product<br />&#9679; Provide and host a website, www.informationrx.org, for interested partners to place orders. The Contractor shall fulfill website orders and provide account management and promail access. There will be no sharing of the data collected with anyone other than the National Library of Medicine.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:<br />The period of performance will be twelve (12) months from date of award, with four (4) additional 12-month option periods.</p>
<p>Payment:<br />Partial payments will be made. Monthly invoices are required.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria<br />Technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the purchase order; however, price is also important to the overall award decision. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The Government can make tradeoffs among pric and technical factors in determining which Quoter offers the best value by awarding to other than the lowest price Quoter or other than the highest technically rated Quoter. Quoters are advised that award will be made to that Quoter whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>In determining which quote represents the best value and results in the lowest overall price alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs, the Government shall evaluate quotes using the following technical evaluation criteria, which are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation processes:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria</p>

Because of the correction to the Solicitation Number on the W912DS-13-R-0011 announcement, can you confirm that Solicitation W912DS-13-R-0011 is not a part of Solicitation W912DS-13-R-0007? <br>   <br> A1. W912DS-13-R-0011 is the solicitation number for curbside debris removal.  It was amended because two different solicitation numbers were included in the initial FBO.gov post.

Synopsis.     <br>      <br>   The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information (RFI) or Sources Sought Announcement (SSA), or to otherwise pay for the information requested.  Your response will be treated as information only.  This RFI/SSA shall not be considered as an invitation for bids, request for quotations, or a Request for Proposals (RFP).  It shall not be used as a proposal.  This RFI/SSA is issued for the purpose of conducting pre-solicitation planning and market research to determine production capabilities for the procurement of the counterfire target acquisition radar (AN/TPQ-53) system including training in support of OCONUS tasks.  This RFI/SSA is a market research tool to determine potential sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a RFP.   <br>      <br>   This RFI/SSA is being issued to satisfy a requirement of the February 2012 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) which required Product Manager Radars (PM Radars) to conduct market research to ascertain industry's ability and interest in satisfying AN/TPQ-53 production requirements.  The information gained from the RFI/SSA will be used to support development of a business case analysis which assesses the feasibility of reintroducing competition for FRP in FY14.  It is the intent of this RFI/SSA to accomplish the following four objectives:   <br>      <br>   a.  Conduct market research to determine interested sources capable of producing and delivering AN/TPQ-53 FRP assets.   <br>      <br>   b.  Obtain information from interested sources on their radar technology capabilities and abilities to meet the specifications of the AN/TPQ-53 system.  Capability statements will not be utilized for any purpose other than for market research.    <br>      <br>   c.  Obtain information from interested sources on their production and manufacturing capabilities to meet system requirements within the proposed acquisition timeline.   <br>      <br>   d.  Request capability statements to assist in developing a procurement strategy to meet the U.S. Army Counterfire Target Acquisition Radar needs.   <br>      <br>   2.  Introduction.   <br>       <br>   a.  Program Description.  The U.S. Army PM Radars and the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) have a requirement for the FRP assets of the AN/TPQ-53.     <br>      <br>   The AN/TPQ-53 radar system will serve as the Army's replacement for the AN/TPQ-36 and 37 radars.  The AN/TPQ-53 system capability shall satisfy known current and future force concept requirements by interfacing with the global information grid and future force battle command systems.  The enhanced capabilities of this radar will provide the Warfighter with continuous and responsive counter-battery target acquisition for all types and phases of military operations.  The AN/TPQ-53 is a highly mobile radar system that will detect projectiles in-flight, as well as determine and communicate the firing point location of rockets, artillery and mortar (RAM).  It will be deployable and capable of operation in varying terrain and climatic conditions.  The system shall provide both 90 and 360 degree azimuth detection coverage against all threats at increased ranges, enhanced human machine interface, ease of programmability, and built-in capacity for growth.  It also will accurately locate and classify hostile weapon locations at greater ranges and coverage patterns to permit more effective detection and counter-battery fires.    <br>      <br>   b.  Program Background and Procurement History.  Current and future forces have a critical and immediate need for a RAM locating system that provides 360 degree detection coverage to mitigate capability gaps in force protection and target detection.  Current indirect fire detection systems lack the mobility and agility to meet the requirements of the supported force and are too large and slow to support units in all types of military operations.  Brigade combat teams and Fires Brigades must quickly secure the operational area and the current counterfire systems introduce unnecessary risk to operations.   <br>      <br>   In 2006, the government awarded a contract to Lockheed Martin following full and open competition.  This contract provided for the design of the AN/TPQ-53 radar and the purchase of four radars.  Twelve additional radars were purchased under the same contract in response to a directed procurement in July 2008.  The Army Acquisition Executive approved the acquisition of up to 20 radars.  Seventeen of the 20 were purchased via letter contract in April 2010.  Three additional assets were procured in August 2011.  On 29 February 2012, the government competitively awarded a firm fixed price contract (W15P7T-12-C-C015) for procurement of up to 54 low rate initial production assets and spares.  The table below provides procurement history information.     <br>      <br>   Contract Number	Award Date	Contractor	Extent Competed/Authority   <br>   W15P7T-06-C-T004	26 Sep 06	Lockheed Martin	Competed   <br>   W15P7T-06-C-T004	25 Jul 08	Lockheed Martin	Option Award (FAR 17.2)   <br>   W15P7T-06-C-T004	12 Apr 10	Lockheed Martin	Letter Contract; award of 17 systems as part of an undefinitized contract action (UCA) (FAR 16.302-1)   <br>   W15P7T-06-C-T004	11 Aug 11	Lockheed Martin	UCA Definitization; award of 3 systems (FAR 16.302-1)   <br>   W15P7T-12-C-C015	29 Feb 12	Lockheed Martin	Competed   <br>      <br>       <br>   3.  Full Rate Production Acquisition Approach.    <br>      <br>   a.  Acquisition/Procurement Strategy Planning Information.  The FRP contract will be a single award, firm fixed price (FFP) contract comprised of a base year, with multiple separately priced options and range quantities.  Spares, new equipment training, and technical manuals will also be acquired on a FFP basis.  The contract will include cost plus fixed fee provisions for services.  The scope of cost plus efforts will include, but not be limited to:  operations; maintenance and repair; interim contractor support; test support; studies and analysis; field support representatives; threat support upgrade; software maintenance and updates; technology insertion and fielding support.  PM Radars anticipates release of the solicitation in fourth quarter fiscal year 2013 (4QFY13), with an anticipated award date of 3QFY14.     <br>      <br>   b.  FRP Requirements.  All AN/TPQ-53 Performance Work Statement (PWS) and Performance Specification requirements will be stated in performance based terms.  Proposed systems are required to be production ready upon contract award.  PM Radars plans to structure contract requirements to ensure industry has the flexibility to employ existing manufacturing and management processes.  Industry will further have the flexibility to propose and use facilities, plants and processes, which are the same as they use for commercial production.    <br>      <br>   PM Radars anticipates contract award in 3QFY14.  AN/TPQ-53 FRP is planned to commence in FY 14.  If all options are exercised, production of approximately 70 systems is planned for from FY14 to FY18.    <br>   The government estimates a production quantity range between 12-25 systems per year.  As currently planned, a key factor of the source selection process will include a Live Ammunition System Demonstration (LASD).  The demonstration is planned to take place during first and second quarter FY14 and would require contractors to provide a production representative system for demonstration to a LASD test plan, PWS and Performance Specification of the system.  LASD results will be used to evaluate the risk(s) of achieving the required performance within the specified schedule and demonstration of production readiness of the system.   <br>      <br>   Production systems will utilize the Army's family of medium tactical vehicles (FMTV) with the long term armor strategy (LTAS) armored cab as the prime mover of the system.  It is intended that the FMTV LTAS will be provided as government furnished equipment (GFE) upon award of the production contract.     <br>      <br>   Other key objectives of the FRP contract and the AN/TPQ-53 radar program are to reduce operational support and life cycle sustainment costs of the radar system, while ensuring the program is delivering the best technologies and most effective capabilities to the Warfighter.   <br>      <br>   A copy of the draft Performance Specification, as well as a copy of FMTV LTAS technical data package, will be made available to interested parties upon request.    <br>      <br>   4.  Request for Information.    <br>      <br>   The government is interested in receiving information from industry on the aforementioned proposed Acquisition Strategy; your company's radar technology capabilities and the ability to meet the AN/TPQ-53 radars system specifications; technology innovations; your production and manufacturing capabilities to meet system requirements within the planned production timeline;  identification of cost drivers; recommended milestone schedule for accomplishing production requirements, training in support of OCONUS; and any other information that may be relevant.  This will enable the government to assess an appropriate acquisition strategy and your company's ability to meet the requirements and specifications of the system.   <br>   Responses should include the following pieces of information at a minimum:   <br>      <br>   a.  State whether or not your firm is interested in participating as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor on the AN/TPQ-53 FRP contract.   <br>      <br>   b.

<p dir="ltr" align="left">Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The solicitation, attachments, and any subsequent amendments will be available at <a href="https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP"><span>https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP</span></a><span> on the issue date of 02/04/13. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c )(1). Approved source is: Ontic Engineering (45934). While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY FOR A LABOR HOUR CONTRACT WITH TRAVEL IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL TRAVEL REGULATIONS FOR CONTRACT AUDIT SERVICES. 

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from accounting firms capable of performing government contract/contractor audit and advisory services nationwide. Government contract audits and attestation engagements such as, examinations provide an opinion and agreed upon procedures performed in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS). These services include, but are not limited to: examination of proposals, incurred costs, interim and final contract billings, contract audit closing statements, financial capability, accounting systems, estimating systems, purchasing systems and other internal controls within the contractors operational environment. Non-audit services include, but are not limited to: comparison of accounting practices used for proposals against incurred costs, verification of direct/indirect costs with the way they are recorded in the books and records, verification of labor rate calculations, and verification of proposed or claimed amounts to supporting data.  

FAA expects tasks to focus on contractor incurred cost audits in compliance with (GAGAS) and Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) audit programs and methodologies/definitions per DCAA Audit Manual (both found under www.dcaa.mil).  

The successful contractor shall be a licensed Certified Public Accounting firm with at least 5 years of experience in performing audits in accordance with GAGAS. 

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

In order to make a capability determination and to be considered eligible for participation in a subsequent request for proposals, should one occur, the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors ; Work Samples.  Submit redacted copies of two (2) federal audit reports prepared by your firm of audits performed by your firm: All proprietary information must be marked.

The Capability statement should specifically identify your experience in the types of audit service the FAA is looking for providing the reference contacts names, addresses and emails.  

a.	Work Samples. Redacted copies of two audit reports prepared by your firm should be marked as Proprietary Information on each page. 

b.	One Incurred Cost Audit

c.	Either a Forward Pricing Rate Proposal  Audit or Forward Pricing Proposal Audit

d.	Either a Post-Award Accounting System Audit or Paid Voucher Review 

(B)	Completed Business Declaration Form (attached).

(C)	Geographical areas where your company can provide services.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.
This is a Request for Information (RFI) by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD).  This Request for Information is published in accordance with FAR Part 15.201(e), and is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.
  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), or a commitment by the U. S. Government, nor should it be construed as such.  Respondents are advised that NSWCDD is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.  There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or reimburse  RFI preparation costs incurred by any offeror when providing the information requested under this notice.  If a solicitation is released at a future date, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.
THIS REQUIREMENT WAS SYNOPSIZED ON 09/12/2012 AND MODIFIED WITH A NEW FSC GROUP (5895/MISCELLANEOUS COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT) ON Oct 17, 2012 WITH A CLOSING DATE OF 21 December, 2012.
  THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS BEING EXTENDED TO CLOSE OF BUSINESS 01 April 2013.

It is the responsibility of any potential offeror to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement. 
This sources sought (RFI) is for investigating COTS (CommercialOff-The Shelf) software and hardware CODECs (Code-decode) for the purpose of both bandwidth reduction within a tactical environment and enabling the ability to transmit multimedia data through bandwidth limited communication systems. as set forth in the specifications attached hereto.  


Compression Algorithm Requirements Statement of Work

The First Mile Communications team at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) will test and evaluate Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) compression systems in both hardware and software configurations.
 

NSWCDD has an interest in investigating software and hardware CODECs (code-decode) for the purpose of both bandwidth reduction within a tactical environment and enabling the ability to transmit multimedia data through bandwidth limited communication systems. Compressing images and videos are both of interest.

FMC has been funded through the Deployable Force Protection (DFP) program to evaluate current available CODEC solutions that can be fielded efficiently and cost-effectively. While this RFI comes with no monetary compensation, it will provide an opportunity for small companies with novel CODECs to receive attention from decision makers in the military currently seeking codec solutions to address the bandwidth issues stated above.

CODECs must, at a minimum:
1.	Contain a complete code-decode solution, with all appropriate executables
2.	Run on or be compatible within  Windows 7 operating systems
3.	For hardware solutions, the system must be compatible with either USB or Ethernet hardware interfaces
4.	Come with a one year royalty free nonexclusive no cost license for evaluation


In an effort to determine how a CODEC will perform in an environment applicable to the DoD, a set of established criteria will serve as guidelines throughout the evaluation.
 CODECs will be graded based on performance in the following areas:

To-network latency: This includes the delays incurred in processing of network data.  Latency and bandwidth are obviously interrelated, but the goal is to avoid excessive bottlenecking that prevents data from filling the network pipe.
-	 1 to 3 second latencies may be acceptable if: 
o	1) Higher picture quality is achieved 
o	2) Higher bandwidth efficiency

Bandwidth utilization
-	The evaluation will be targeted at a range between 4 and 100 kilobits per second (kbps)
-	The maximum bandwidth utilization should be no more than 120% of the average bandwidth profile.
-	The system shall demonstrate the ability to dynamically configure the video bandwidth settings to adapt to real-time changes.
-	User shall have the ability to select either constant bit rate or variable bit rate 
-	Option to  reduce I-frame refresh size throughgradual decoder refresh option
-	Ability to select/de-select B frame inclusion

Decompressed Image/Video Quality
-	A Picture Quality Analyzer (PQA) will be used to evaluate image quality.
 Assessment of decompressed images/video will be compared to original images/video to quantify image degradation.

Frame rate/frame size
-	User shall have the ability to dictate desired frame rate, ideally including the range of one frame per second up to 32 frames per second. The frame rate may be adjusted in order to reach a targeted bandwidth.
-	User shall indicate frame sizes QCIF (176x144) to CIF (352x288). The ability to choose a frame size of SQCIF (128x96) up to 4CIF (704x480) is ideal but not required.  Adherence to PAL or NTSC standards desired.

Usability- Questions of the following nature will be considered:
-	What are the challenges of implementing the CODEC in a military environment?
-	Can resolutions and compression streams be changed on the fly? 
-	How often is a program restart required?
-	What is the CPU consumption of any downloaded software required for CODEC?
-	What are the storage requirements of relevant CODEC software?
-	What are the physical dimensions of the CODEC (if a hardware solution)

The government reserves the right to collect other data not listed here in order to fairly evaluate all compression algorithms.

The following is also requested, if applicable:
1.	Prior test data/test reports 
2.	Methods for optimization
3.	If H.264 based, describe baselines
4.	Long term implementation cost estimates

Every business submitting a novel CODEC will receive a report produced by NSWC Dahlgren Division at the end of the evaluation.
 This report will not be distributed beyond the government. The reports may be distributed outside of NSWCDD to other government organizations that express interest in the CODEC. The CODEC itself will remain in the hands of NSWCDD government personnel. NSWCDD reserves the right to demonstrate CODEC performance to the DoD and its contractors. Submission of a CODEC does not guarantee its demonstration at any point in time.

The Government does not intend to make an award based on the submission of a CODEC for evaluation or otherwise pay for the information requested. Submission of a CODEC and supplementary papers is voluntary and does not obligate the Government or NSWCDD to pay or entitle the submitter to payment.
 Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this Request for Information (RFI). Feedback from the government regarding CODEC performance is not a guarantee of future initiative funding.

Responses to this RFI should include as much detailed technical information as possible. 
There are no limitations on what a response should include, but it should have at a minimum:

This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposals are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Office of Operations (HOP), has a requirement for operations support activities to improve transportation system operations. The FHWA HOP has determined the need to issue a sole source contract to the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) to support key program areas as they relate to the use of technology and knowledge transfer to influence the development of policies and procedures within State departments of transportations (DOTs) to provide improved benefits to the traveling public by optimizing the operations of state transportation systems. ITE is an international educational and scientific association of transportation professionals. ITE's specific areas of focus are meeting mobility and safety needs; both of which align with the FHWA Office of Operations' (HOP) roles and responsibilities for congestion reduction, incident management, work-zone safety, and freight mobility.  ITE is comprised of a community of nearly 17,000 transportation professionals including transportation engineers, transportation planners, consultants, educators, and researchers. ITE is a source for expertise, knowledge and ideas that HOP can tap quickly, efficiently, and effectively.  No other association has such a wealth of resources and full alignment with HOP's responsibilities, requirements, and needs.  This is a re-procurement of an existing requirement currently being performed by ITE under Contract No. DTFH61-06-D-00042 awarded as a sole source award. Pursuant to FAR 6.305, "Availability of the Justification," this Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOTFOC) document is hereby posted and made publicly available at www.FedBizOpps.gov. Per FAR 5.207 (c) (16)(ii) all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
