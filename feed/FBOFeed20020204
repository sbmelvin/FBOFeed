<DESC>Aircraft Maintenance.  The National Interagency Fire Center has a need to increase the amount of time services can be obtained under five existing aircraft maintenance contracts that expire in February.  This extension of time is needed in order to keep the fleet maintained until follow-on contracts are in place.  Competitive follow-on contracts are in the process of being solicited under Request for Proposals Number 49-02-01, and we anticipate new contracts to be awarded in May of 2002.  Due to the emergency nature of our work, it is critical that the services be maintained without a break in service.  
Aircraft maintenance services include the inspection, repair, alteration, installation or modification, refurbishment, overhaul and painting of aircraft, and the purchase, installation, and rebuilding of aircraft parts, engines, propellers, components, accessories, and avionics.  Any offeror interested in submitting a technical proposal is given notice that the repair qualifications and knowledge of the aircraft being repaired must be demonstrated.  The following technical criteria must be addressed and will be evaluated (more detailed text available upon request):  (1) Past Performance, (2) Knowledge and Understanding of the Work, (3) Facilities and Equipment, (4) Experience, and (5) Offeror Location.
The NIFC believes that the existing five contracts should be extended for a short time.  All other interested firms may submit technical proposals in response to this notice.  Proposals shall address the technical evaluation criteria above, and must be received by the close of business on March 4, 2002.  A determination not to open this short term requirement to competition is solely within the discretion of the Government based upon it's evaluation of proposals received.
Please note that proposals received as a result of this notice will be considered only for the purpose of determining whether it is appropriate and possible to obtain competitive procurements for this short-term requirement.  No solicitation document is currently available. 
When calling be prepared to state name, address, and solicitation number.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered. ********

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-LSDDP-Review
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, LSDDP Project Office Manager, Phone (716) 942-4244, Email lsddp@wvnsco.com
<DESC>A Large Scale Demonstration and Deployment Project (LSDDP) has been initiated to demonstrate and deploy technologies to support the decontamination and decommissioning of radioactively-contaminated cells located at the West Valley Demonstration Project (WVDP) in West Valley, NY, the Battelle Columbus Laboratories Decommissioning Project (BCLDP) in West Jefferson, OH, and the Hanford site in Richland, WA.  These cells contain radioactively contaminated piping, equipment, and loose debris that must be removed.  The goal of the LSDDP is to select technologies that can reduce costs, shorten schedules, enhance safety, and decrease mortgage costs at the above facilities and at similar sites across the DOE complex.  Further information regarding specific technology needs are identified at the LSDDP website www.wv.doe.gov/lsddp.  In addition, general information regarding previous LSDDPs is available on the D&D Focus Area website www.netl.doe.gov/dd under the (Projects) heading.

The LSDDP will identify innovative, improved technologies for characterization, size reduction, decontamination, remote handling and retrieval, remote viewing, dismantlement, or application of contamination fixatives.  Performance indicators such as cost, technical effectiveness, implementation capability, worker exposure, and secondary waste generation will be measured and reported for each technology demonstrated.

Candidate technologies should be fully developed and ready for large-scale demonstration.  The LSDDP will consider technologies that present a clear advantage over baseline practices and should be documented through previous field application in either a nuclear or non-nuclear setting, or in bench-scale operations.  Technologies selected for demonstration will be utilized in actual facilities with high radiation and contamination levels.  Technologies that have been previously demonstrated in an LSDDP will not be considered for this LSDDP.

Selection of potential suppliers for the LSDDP will be established through a two (2) step process (i.e., Step I - Expressions of Interest and Capability Review and Step II - Request for Proposal (RFP) Participation).  Under Step I, interested suppliers are requested to submit documentation demonstrating their capability to perform or provide equipment for a large scale deployment demonstration.  The LSDDP Evaluation Team will evaluate the responses to determine which suppliers best meet the evaluation criteria.  Suppliers which are determined by the LSDDP Evaluation Team to best meet the evaluation criteria will be eligible to participate in Step II through the receipt of a formal RFP.  Suppliers not selected to participate in Step II will be notified in writing. For a complete description of the evaluation criteria and submittal and schedule requirements, please refer to the LSDDP web-site http://www.wv.doe.gov/lsddp/FedBizOps.html.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT 
WANTS TO ACQUIRE SITE
JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI

Public notice is given that the General Services Administration (GSA) will conduct an investigation of possible sites to be acquired for the construction of a new United States Courthouse in Jackson, Mississippi.  As part of this investigation, GSA hereby solicits either donation of a site to the United States of America or a no-cost option to purchase property.

Approximately 4 to 5 acres is required within the downtown delineated area described as the area bounded by the following:

           EAST:    Jefferson Street from South Street to High Street
           SOUTH:   South Street from the Railroad tracks to Jefferson 
  Street
           WEST:    Railroad tracks from Hamilton Street to South Street
           NORTH:   High Street from Jefferson Street to John Street, 
  and from John Street to Hamilton Street and from 
  Hamilton Street to the railroad tracks

Owners of parcels totaling less than the size of the site specified, but to which abutting parcels may be added to produce a site of the required size, are encouraged to offer such properties for inspection.  

Sites which may be donated to the Federal Government are solicited, as well as sites which are for sale.  Offers of a donated site or of a no-cost option to purchase property should be submitted in letter form and include an accurate description and sketch of the site offered.  Offers should be received on or before February 22, 2002.

Owners may submit their own proposals.  Proposals submitted by agents must be accompanied by documentary evidence of the agent?s authority to make such offers.  This is to advise persons submitting offers, that the Government considers any offer to be a firm option through October 1, 2002, or as extended by agreement of the parties.  The Government will make every effort to expedite the site selection.

Representatives of GSA will be in Jackson on March 11, 2002, for the purpose of the site investigation and can be contacted on this date from 1:00 to 4:00 P.M. at 100 W. Capitol Street, Suite 501A, or at 601-965-4449, ext. 13.

This advertisement is not a basis for negotiation, and the right is hereby reserved as the interest of the Government may require, to reject any or all offers and give consideration to sites other than those offered in response to this advertisement.

This site acquisition is being conducted pursuant to statutory authority contained in the Public Buildings Act of 1959, as amended.  40 U.S.C. 601, et seq.  Pursuant to this authority, GSA is authorized to conduct this site selection without regard to the competitive procurement procedures contained in Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, commonly referred to as the Competition in Contracting Act.

The following criteria are being used to consider offered sites, which satisfy the minimum requirement:

The site must be located in the defined delineated area in downtown Jackson; the site must be of sufficient size as defined above; and, the owner must have marketable title.

General evaluation factors to be considered are:  ability of the site to meet certain environmental requirements, ability of the site to comply with certain regulatory requirements; functionally of the site; and, design development features of the site that would impact the proposed project. 

In addition to the above criteria, the total cost of the project considering both the acquisition cost of the site and estimated development and operating costs will be considered.  The Government will select the site considered tobe most advantageous to the United States after all factors have been considered.  In order to ensure that the selected site is most advantageous to the United States, the Government will also consider any unique attributes or other nuances of a site deemed worthy of consideration, even if not listed above.

None of the above listed evaluation criteria are considered to be more important than any other.  However, as sites are evaluated, each site?s unique attributes may result in one or more criteria becoming more important as to that particular site.  The final selection of the site is within the sole discretion of the government.

The facility will have state of the art communications technology, fiber optic cable and the latest computer equipment capable of rapidly reporting data b ase strengths.  Acquisition strategy for the complex is to be a two-phase design-build request for proposals. ****   This project will be procured using the two-phase design-build selection procedures set forth in FAR 36.3.  In phase one, offerors will receive a request for proposal letter including the project description, submittal requirements, and evaluation factors for both phases.  The evaluation factors for phase one will be offeror past performance, quality of construction, timeliness of performance, documentation, customer satisfaction, subcontractor management, technical approach narrative, offeror relevant expe rience.  No more than five offerors will be invited to participate in phase two. The Government anticipates that the phase two documents will be issued on or about April 4, 2002. Award will be made to that offeror whose proposal contains the combination of  those criteria offering the best overall value to the Government.  This will be determined by comparing differences in the value of technical and management features with differences in cost to the Government.  In making this comparison, the Government is  concerned with striking the most advantageous balance between technical and management features and cost to the Government.  As technical scores and relative advantages and disadvantages become less distinct, differences in price between proposals are of increased importance in determining the most advantageous proposal.  Conversely, as differences in price become less distinct, differences in scoring and relative advantages and disadvantages between proposals are of increased importance to the determinati on.  The Government reserves the right to accept other than the lowest priced offer.  The right is also reserved to reject any and all offers.  The basis of award will be a conforming offer; the price or cost of which may or may not be the lowest.  Offeror s are reminded to include their best technical and price terms in their initial proposal and not to automatically assume that they will have an opportunity to participate in discussions or be asked to submit a revised offer.  The Government may make award of a conforming proposal without discussions, if deemed to be within the best interests of the Government.  There are no options under consideration at this time, however the need for options will be re-evaluated upon completion of the Phase Two RFP solici tation preparation and prior to the Phase Two Requests for Technical and Price Proposals being issued.  Estimated cost range of project is from $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00. Network Analysis System will be required.

<CONTACT>Xinia Llovet-Zurinaga, 508-233-4146
<DESC>NA The US Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager - Force Sustainment Systems, Natick, MA, has a requirement for a cargo parachute that will enable cargo aerial delivery operations, using standard low velocity airdrop extraction techniques, from an altit ude of 500 feet Above Ground Level (AGL).  It is intended that this new cargo parachute will replace both the G-11 and G-12 cargo parachutes.  This new cargo parachute, used in either a single or clustered configuration, shall have the following performanc e characteristics: capable of delivering combat loads having rigged weights between 2,520 pounds through 22,000 pounds (objective) (15,500 pounds (threshold)); capable of deploying/recovering from military cargo aircraft traveling between 130-150 knots ind icated air speed (KIAS); deliver loads in ground wind speeds of 17 knots (threshold) (21 knots (objective)); maximum rate of descent at ground impact shall not exceed 28.5 ft/sec; provide a successful airdrop completion rate of 92 percent without a system abort; capable of being used in mass formation airdrops of supplies and equipment, singularly, and sequentially using current tactics for delivery of Strategic Brigade Airdrop (medium) loads; deliver loads in fully mission capable (FMC) condition with mini mal modification to standard airdrop rigging (threshold) and FMC condition with no change to the airdrop rigging (objective); capable of being packed and rigged in a time greater than the time required for current comparable LVAD loads with like capacities  (threshold) or a time equal to or less than that of current operations (objective); be fully compatible with existing airdrop components (i.e. Type V platform and associated airdrop hardware) (threshold) or with new or modified components (objective); cap able of operation and storage in the same climate categories (hot, basic, cold, and severe cold) as current LVAD operations; be supportable by the standard Army logistics system, and maintainable by MOS 92R rigger personnel at organizational level; must la nd the airdropped cargo within a low circular area of probability.  It is desired that this new cargo parachute be compatible for application to all platform and container low velocity cargo airdrop, including C-17 Dual Row Airdrop Capability (DRAC) and th e developmental Enhanced Container Delivery Capability (ECDC).  Emphasis on durable lightweight materials and low/simplified maintenance is highly desired.  Proposals that discuss existing systems, which demonstrate substantial compliance with 500' LVADC p erformance requirements, will be favorably considered than entirely new designs or engineering approaches. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on the Soldier Systems Center web site located at https://www3.natick.army.mil/ under Business Opportun ities/Ongoing Acquisitions/DAAD15-02-R-0013 on or about March 6, 2002. NO hardcopies will be mailed. Telephone calls will not be accepted. Questions may be sent to Xinia Llovet-Zurinaga, Contract Specialist, via e-mail at Xinia.Llovet-Zurinaga@natick.army. mil or fax (508) 233-5286 or 4998. Firms will not be reimbursed for any cost associated with proposal preparation.  Proposal evaluation will include, but not be limited to, the following processes: A RFP will be issued and offerors' proposals will be evalu ated to determine the item's ability to meet the above requirements.  A competitive range will be established and offerors of proposals that fall within the range will be issued purchase orders for prototype parachutes to be tested and evaluated.  A minimu m of five prototypes parachutes must be ready for testing 60 days after issuance of purchase order.  Offerors will be required to provide packing/rigging, repair and training support during these tests, and will be compensated for such support as a separat e Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) in the purchase order. These prototypes will be tested and evaluated against performance requirements and will compete agains t a government developed cargo parachute referred to as the SB-60.  A down-select to one or more cargo parachutes will be conducted and will be based on the offeror's proposal and results of the initial test and evaluation of the prototype parachutes.  A c ontract will then be awarded to the successful offerors to include an option for Demonstration/Validation (D/V) and an option for Developmental/Operational Testing (DT/OT).  D/V will include CLINs for parachutes, engineering, and testing support.  The D/V option will be part of the base effort requiring 2-10 parachutes from each vendor and will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee type contract.  Test items will undergo evaluation for fit, form and function, and will also be subjected to airdrop testing.  After testing  and evaluation, a down-select will be conducted by an Integrated Product Team (IPT) to exercise an option to a single offeror to deliver 5 (minimum) to 75 (maximum) production ready parachutes.  These items will be subjected to DT/OT to determine if they satisfy all performance requirements identified in the ORD.  This option will include CLINs for parachutes, engineering, and testing support.  Also included in this option will be the requirement for the delivery of a Technical Data Package (TDP) (to inclu de complete drawings and detailed specifications).  Upon completion of DT/OT testing, a Production Delivery Order (OPTION - Firm Fixed Price) may be issued to meet the Army's initial estimated fielding requirements of approximately 1,165 cargo parachutes.  Follow on production contracts may be awarded, based on the TDP, to acquire the remainder of the Army's estimated fielding requirements of approximately 10,481 cargo parachutes.  This acquisition will be conducted on a Full and Open Competitive basis.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. EPA, Office of Research and Development intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Annette L. Bunge of the Colorado School of Mines to develop experimental protocols for measuring release rates of chemicals from soil using a technique called Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) and develop guidance for how to decide if this is a rate limiting step and, if so, how the release rates would be used to estimate dermally absorbed dose.  The contractor shall prepare and deliver a Quality Assurance Plan 30 days after contract award and prepare and deliver a  report on laboratory protocols for measuring soil release 90 days after contract award.  This notice is not a request for quotations.  EPA's reseach indicates Dr. Annette Bunge with the Colorado School of Mines is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement based on the fact that the conceptual  basis for SPME was developed by  Dr. Bunge.  Her research has demonstrated that for many chemicals, the rate at which a chemical is released from soil is the limiting step for how much is actually absorbed into the skin.  Any firms believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirements may submit  technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the statement of work.  Such documentation must be submitted to the Point of Contact within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this  notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition  Procedures.

<SUBJECT>A -- HIGH PRODUCTIVITY COMPUTING SYSTEMS (HPCS) INDUSTRY STUDY
<SOLNBR>BAA02-09
<RESPDATE>020503
<ARCHDATE>02062003
<CONTACT>Robert Graybill, Program Manager, DARPA/ITO, Phone none, Fax 703-522-7161, Email none
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for the Industrial Research and Development component of the first phase of the High Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS) program.  The HPCS program will provide the DoD with significant technology and capability advancements for the national security and industrial user communities by filling a high-end computing gap that exists between today's High Performance Computing (HPCs) systems based on late 80's technology and the promise of quantum computing.  These new systems will address ongoing technical challenges that confront both development and use of current high-end systems and applications, such as programming productivity, performance, portability, scalability, reliability, and tamper resistance.  The end product will be economically viable high productivity computing systems with both scalable vector and commodity HPC system functionality for the national security and industrial user communities.  The proposed technology development plan is part of a three-phase program that may extend up to the end of this decade. The three phases are concept study, research and development (R&D), and full scale development.  The major overall objective is to provide high productivity computing system solutions to fill both the technology and high end computing platform gap in order to address national security missions that will exist by the end of this decade and into the next decade.  Early identification of high-end computing application computing requirements, metrics, and productivity prediction tools will be used throughout the program to assess both technical and schedule progress.  This Phase 1 industry concept study solicitation is focused on the identification of critical revolutionary technologies and candidate system concepts required for the follow on R&D and full scale development phases. The ultimate long term program objective is to provide pilot HPCS systems by the end of this decade.  Research is sought in the following technical areas and is intended to be consistent with overall Phase 1 industry concept study goals.  1)  Industry R&D: The key tasks are to perform HPCS system concept studies resulting in a final concept review and Phase 2 recommendations by the end of Phase 1. The successful execution of this task is dependent on the ability to develop a balanced total solution by incorporating HPCS application and end user requirements, developing meaningful scalable productivity "value" metrics, identifying and assessing critical technologies (Tasks 2 and 3), and leveraging research efforts being performed by universities, research laboratories, and government agencies.   The challenge will be to develop the concepts for a "productive" system that will have the ability to double in value every 18 months not just peak performance (Moore's Law), over the next two decades. Throughout this effort, DoD operational and research software applications will serve as the requirements driver for architecture and software research and systems assessment.  Industry adoption is seen as a central strategy to ensure that cost-effective solutions are made available to the national security community.  2)  Technology Component:  The major technology areas requiring development in support of the next generation of productivity systems are: (1) System Architecture; (2) Programming Models; (3) Software Technology; and (4) Hardware Technology.  This task demands an industry "whole system" perspective. It is expected that a full assessment will be made of complementary DARPA technology projects, industry developments, and government agency research.  3)  Application Analysis and Performance Assessment Component:  Key to the research and development of new high productivity computing systems is the ability to measure and understand critical performance characteristics for the entire system - both hardware and software.  The ability to characterize and predict performance will provide a clearer picture of future hardware and software requirements and serves as a critical basis for evaluation and development of high-end systems.  Therefore, it is vital that a broad spectrum of potential HPCS applications be analyzed to extract the key HPCS system design characteristics, parameters, constraints and programming environments.  PROGRAM SCOPE:  The Phase 1 efforts envisioned under this BAA will be 12-month concept studies with an expected start in 3QFY02.  HPCS proposers shall address all three tasks and pursue a balanced technology and system development path.  Up to five awards under this BAA are expected with each award to fall into the range of $2.5 Million to $3 Million.  Each selected activity will incorporate support for two HPCS Principal Investigators' meetings and up to three individual program effort reviews, plus a number of technology review meetings intended to enable the consideration of other relevant research activities.  Additional HPCS program background information is available on http://www.darpa.mil/ito/research/hpcs.html. The efforts funded under this BAA shall specifically consider and examine technologies being investigated and advanced by the ongoing DARPA Data Intensive Systems (DIS) and Polymorphous Computing Architectures (PCA) programs.  Data on these programs can be found at the DARPA ITO web site.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.   Research should result in prototype hardware and/or software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on a specific system or solution.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.  Proposals may involve other research groups or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.  PROGRAM MANAGEMENT:  The industry R&D component of the HPCS program solicited by this BAA is perceived as industry led teams with university and research laboratory involvement as required to support this solicitation.  A desire is to leverage and incorporate as feasible complementary parallel research efforts being performed by universities, research laboratories, and government agencies. Multiple contract types will be considered including other transactions.  Throughout all phases of the HPCS effort, DoD operational and research software applications will serve as the requirements driver for architecture and software research and systems assessment.  Industry adoption is seen as a central strategy to ensure that cost-effective solutions are made available to the national security community. The new HPCS performance predictors and benchmarks/stressmarks to be developed as part of the HPCS program will provide an accurate measure of emerging HPCS concepts and commercial industry HPCS products and their effectiveness for intended DoD applications.  GENERAL INFORMATION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Information Technology Office (DARPA/ITO) requires completion of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Cover Sheet Submission for each Proposal, by accessing the URL below:  http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=02-09   After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet Submission, the proposer must submit the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page.  Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and submitting it attached to the "original" and each designated number of copies.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of your Proposal.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.  NEW REQUIREMENTS/PROCEDURES:  The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA/ITO Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report.  These reports will be electronically submitted via the DARPA/ITO Technical - Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The goal of this solicitation is to seek applications for research and development processes which will enable the commercial deployment of several emerging ironmaking technologies in the U.S.A. within the next six years. The goal is to provide the domestic steel industry with additional alternative quality ironmaking capacity that is less dependent on the availability of coke.  This solicitation targets ironmaking processes that displace coke with coal, natural gas, and other reductants/fuels.  This solicitation addresses a critical Steel Technology Roadmap need for advanced alternate ironmaking processes to achieve commercial scale.  Multi-partner collaborations among steel companies, and equipment suppliers and/or engineering firms is mandatory.  Up to $3,000,000 in federal funds are expected to be available to fund the selected ironmaking projects for the first year.  It is anticipated that equivalent funds should be available for any subsequent years. DOE anticipates making two (2) to three (3) cooperative agreement awards each with a duration of three years or less.   A minimum 50% non-federal cost share is required. Cost share may be provided as cash or in-kind cost share, but may not include other federal funding.

 No, there was no survey completed in 2001.

5.	What do the initials "JB", "EA", and "LT" stand for on the Schedule?

Response:

JB is job, EA is each, and LT is lot.

6.	Will the contractor have information on NIST employee email addresses and home addresses?

Response:

The contractor will not receive the NIST email addresses or home addresses.  Any communication from the contractor to the staff or management will be made through the Program Office.

The solicitation will be issued for full and open competition.  A draft listing of the items to be procured and the estimated quantities for the full five-year period are attached.  The brand named items have been identified as meeting or exceeding the Government's minimum requirements, but are not established as the standards upon which other offered brand named items will be evaluated.  A paper copy solicitation will not be issued.  The final solicitation will be posted to this website (www.eps.gov).  The Government will evaluate offers for multiple awards and will use a savings of $500 as a benchmark amount for determining if it is cost-effective to make more than one award.  However, due to the administrative burden of administering multiple contracts, the Government does not anticipate awarding more than 3 contracts as a result of this solicitation.

<DESC>Water Desalination Process
Technology Transfer Opportunity

Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico, has invented a new low-temperature, low-pressure process for desalting water (SD-7057).  This process combines direct osmosis with other operations and has the potential for significant increases in overall energy efficiency compared to the current state of the art to produce a purified water stream.  The process may require less pretreatment of feed streams prior to the purification process.  Among other factors, the development of optimized membranes for direct osmosis will be key to the success of this process.  Sandia is making this technology available to companies interested in further developing and maturing this technology into a market-ready water purification process for commercialization.  Interested parties should anticipate participating in, and funding a multi-year, research and development project at Sandia to further develop the technology for commercialization.  Respondents should have experience with industrial membrane and membrane system design and fabrication, osmotic distillation or direct osmosis, water treatment technologies, surface and ground water chemistry, and chemical process engineering.  
For further information, please respond by mail or fax to Alane Dulski no later than February 28, 2002, at:  Sandia National Laboratories, MS 1380, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185-1380.
