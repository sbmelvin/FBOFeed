<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) has a requirement for certain modifications to the IMS-1500C radiotheodolite to increase the effectiveness of the system.  Most, if not all, of the modifications are expected to be software modifications.  The IMS-1500C radiotheodolite is deployed at 10 upper air sites in the Caribbean; additionally, there is an IMS-1500C radiotheodolite used for testing purposes at the NWS Sterling, Virginia test facility.  The modifications shall be delivered and installed at all 11 sites within 140 days after contract award.  NOAA intends to negotiate this requirement on a sole source basis with International Met Systems (InterMet), located in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  InterMet is the sole manufacturer of the IMS-1500C, and is the designer and developer of the software used in the IMS-1500C radiotheodolite.  InterMet is the only known source having both the technical know-how and the proprietary information required to perform the necessary modifications to the IMS-1500C radiotheodolite.  Although NOAA expects that only InterMet can perform the required work, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Solicitation DG133W-07-RP-0178 will be issued on or about August 14, 2007 and will close on or about September 13, 2007.  See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Anna Sandebring.  The contractor will design and perform experiments using FACS to measure the following interrelated parameters of cell viability and mitochondrial function; meet with Laboratory of  Neurogenetics (LNG) personnel to review progress, answer questions, and provide expert advice in support on ongoing studies of mitochondrial function; assist individual LNG scientists and technical personnel in the design of confocal microscopy experiments estimating mitochondrial morphology and connectedness using FRAP;  perform siRNA experiments to interfere with mitochondrial fusion and fission processes, perform staining experiments and provide LNG staff with blinded images for morphological analyses; perform electron microscopy analyses of cell lines and collect and analyze data.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1).  The cited authority is applicable because Anna Sandebring has expert credentials to meet the requirements for this contract.  She has postgraduate level education in Neuroscience and, relevant to this contract, has been trained at the Karolinska Instituet, Stockholm, in FACS and mitochondrial function assays.  In previous work performed as a Special Volunteer at NIA, she has been involved in the characterization of stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in cell lines engineered to be deficient in PINK1.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) intends to issue, a solicitation and purchase order to BAE Systems, Inc., for annual software telephone support for BAE Systems HAG PIII for DII Guard Application and STOP Operating System.     This requirement is for one year and no hardware support is required.     Software must be National Security Agency approved at the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) Class B3 level.     Software lease period is 1 year.  Quantity of leases is seven.  The RFQ document is available via email from Ms Jan Lanham at Janet.Lanham@DISA.MIL.   Telephone: 618-229-9545.

The BAE Systems HAG PIlI system is a turn-key hardware and software National Security Agency (NSA) approved computing platform that enables the PTC to offer services in cross-domain communications and secure messaging across multiple classification levels throughout the Pentagon's Command and Control Defense Messaging Network for its various customers.  The HAG systems are composed of vendor proprietary hardware and software, and are a critical component consistent with the operating environments in which it runs.  The PTC owns and uses several HAG systems which allow information to safely pass between protected secure classified networks, as well as between secure classified and unclassified networks.
The HAG's hardware platform and software have been successfully evaluated by NSA's Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), at the Class B3 level, to prove the system not only incorporated required security features, but has the ability to handle high levels of assurance and testing. To date, there are no other NSA approved systems that can replace the BAE HAG systems. Without the BAE Systems HAGs or its respective software support coverage, the PTC assumes sole operational risks and responsibility of the secured features of the HAG's software platform with no way to guarantee, restore, or successfully protect the messaging and communication exchanges between its secure classified and unclassified networks. 

The purchase/renewal of the BAE Systems HAG PIlI telephone support will ensure adequate software assurancefor the PTC's existing HAG systems which have undergone extensive NSA testing and received NSA approval to operate. The HAG systems have been technically accepted and proven interoperable with other PTC components, its communication infrastructure, and the Pentagon Enterprise Network. The BAE System HAG is the ONLY NSA approved product that is certified and authorized for use to support the PTC mission within DMS.  The estimated cost is $30,000.

Providing a central location within the Federal Government for information about education and providing comprehensive reference services on matters related to education. This purchase order will include access to ProQuest Digital Dissertations and Theses (renewal), ProQuest Education Journals Online with ERIC (renewal), ProQuest National Newspapers9 (new), and Newspaper Direct Press Display for 3 simultaneous users (new). All databases operate on the ProQuest search engine platform and are unique to ProQuest.

ProQuest is the only provider of access to full-text dissertations and theses.

In order to support the critical mission and recognizing ProQuest's status as the representative to the organization undertaking this work, ED intends to place a contract on a sole source basis to ProQuest, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), for Information technology services, including telecommunications services related to providing access to selected electronic databases. Because all these databases operate on the search engine which is proprietary, ProQuest qualifies to perform the needed work and is the only source that will satisfy ED's requirement. All responsible sources, however, may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the agency. 

Naics Codes applicable to this requirement include 518112, web search portals; 511110, newspaper publishers; and, 51120 periodical publishers.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for One VSTARS /S8 system and accessories, a PRO-SPOT Target Projection System, and VSTARS and PRO-SPOT training and support services. The requirements for this portable photogrammetry system are that it is capable of: 1) Measuring the location of sparse flush-mounted retro-reflective targets mounted on the ceiling and walls of the 40-Ft x 80-Ft Wind Tunnel Test Section. An area of the ceiling approximately 100ft x 60ft will be covered with targets placed every 8ft in X and Y. Ceiling target locations need to be measured with an accuracy of 1 part in 100,000. 2) Measuring, with high spatial resolution, the as built geometry of wind tunnel models (e.g., rotor blades) with similar accuracy as identified above.  .  NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from Geodetic Services Inc. because Geodetics is the only provider of close-range photogrammetry tools capable of providing the desired measurements to an accuracy of 1 part in 100,000. What makes Geodetics VSTAR system unique is the integration of their software into the camera head, resulting in the INCA (Intelligent Camera) and simultaneously making a very user-friendly system.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 10, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports research to understand, and ultimately prevent and/or treat, infectious and immune-mediated diseases that continue to threaten millions of lives each year.  The Government has a requirement to design and conduct a multi-site Phase II/III clinical trial for Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). NIAID intends to solicit this project utilizing full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541710. It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about June 15, 2007.  The objective of a contract will be to advance the field of clinical management for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) and to determine the optimal outpatient treatment strategy.  If selected the contractor would be expected to provide the scientific, technical, and managerial infrastructure, facilities, and other resources required to design and conduct a multi-site Phase II/III clinical trial.  In addition, the contractor must have the ability to determine the efficacy of off-patent oral antimicrobials and/or wound care for the treatment of outpatients with uncomplicated community-acquired skin and soft tissue infection in areas in the U.S, where the prevalence of CA-MRSA is high. An uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection is defined as the presence of wound infection, abscesses, folliculitis, cellulitis or erysipelas. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections are defined as the isolation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from the relevant disease process from subjects who have not been hospitalized within the previous fourteen (14) days. In order to preserve the efficacy of vancomycin and linezolid, evaluation of these two antimicrobials would not be supported under this effort. In addition, clinical trials of invasive diseases (e.g., bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomylitis or pneumonia) or clinical trials with hospitalized patients would not be supported under this contract. Clinical trials under this effort would require a minimum of two (2) and a maximum of five (5) clinical trial sites. Each clinical trial site, included would also be required to have access to one hundred and twenty (120) subjects with skin and soft tissue infection every three (3) months to ensure enrollment of a minimum of forty (40) subjects every three (3) months.  It is estimated that a total effort of approximately 9.65 FTEs per year will be needed to accomplish this project.  
This RFP will be available electronically on/about April 15, 2006, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to award of a contract. NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. NO FACSIMILE AND E-MAIL TRANSMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED. See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 08 should be submitted by 15 April 2008; FY 09 by 15 April 2009; and FY 10 by 15 April 2010.  White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 30 Sep 2010, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

 The overall technical objectives of this BAA are to use innovative, disruptive technologies to collect and process ELINT signals and their associated SIGINT information.  Technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence and enhanced or new digital processing hardware / software, will be used to:  (1) Dynamically characterize and correlate databases that use existing multi-source, multi-platform, real-time collection systems;  (2) Enhance collection system efficiency to include multi-platform collection optimization and management;  and (3) Automate digital signal processing hardware and software analysis to enable a man-on-the-loop concept to address the increased volume of data and increased time criticality of analysis, both necessary to support Effects Based Operations of the future. 

The scope of this effort concerns several areas and covers a broad range of issues, which include, but are not limited to the following:  (1) Target specific characteristics identification/correlation; (2) Automated collection, signal ID sorting and first level processing; (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing/analysis technology at both the Operational/Tactical and Scientific and Technical Intelligence (S&TI) levels;   (4) Software aboard UAV platforms which specifically address SIGINT objectives; (5) Advanced knowledge-based processing; and (6) Network centric collection management .

Detailed scope and definition of problems are as follows:  (1) Target characteristic identification/correlation:  Battlefield management depends heavily on ELINT and Electronic Warfare (EW) assets to provide current threat analysis for successful deployment of war-fighting resources.  One area that supports this analysis is target specific operating characterization and equipment/unit correlation which is normally a ?brute-force/labor intensive? effort:  (2) Automated collection, signal identification (ID) sorting and first level processing.  Dense, hard-to-get, advanced modulated, and Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) signals dictate the need for automated, dynamic collection using both on-board / off-board assets.  This area should also allow for the improvement in signal sorting and identification, discrimination (?flagging?) of out-of-limits signals, especially threat systems whose measurable values can readily be characterized.  Continual high-resolution sampling of Intermediate Frequency Modulation (IFM), pulse sorting, and deinterleaving processes using ?fingerprinting? techniques should continue to be investigated as a means to support flagging and automated tracking efforts; Signal identification algorithms for next generation target radars.  (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing:  Environment complexity, as well as advanced collection hardware technology, demands growth in the digital ELINT processing arena.  Efforts should take into consideration current analysis technology available, reduction in processing of routine activity allowing time to be spent on more critical tasks, methods employing horizontal, parallel processing, and how best to insert these solution(s) into existing systems.  (4) Software aboard UAV platforms which specifically address SIGINT objectives:  Given current levels of activity, operational requirements, hostile environments, and resources being heavily tasked, collection systems will need to coordinate and collaborate automatically with UAV-type SIGINT platforms.  Host processing systems will enable net-centric collection and targeting using low power and weight digital receivers and a processing schema that operates modularly, in parallel, and in firmware.  (5) Advanced Knowledge-Based Processing Techniques:  Timely and accurate decision support to the warfighter require innovative knowledge-base processing for sensor management, emitter ID, flagging, and SIGINT fusion to include but not limited to techniques for automated knowledge acquisition and knowledge modeling, real-time inferencing, and real-time operating system. (6) Network centric collection management: Networked SIGINT sensors extend the sensor virtual collection space, thus significantly enhancing the potential to collect LPI/difficult waveform signals. Therefore, network centric collection management should be investigated to include but not be limited to multi-platform signal correlation and multi-INT sensor cueing. Attention should be paid to fusing the sensor measurements and network data bandwidth to support collection management.  Deliverables will be technical reports and, when appropriate, demonstrations. 

II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $24.5M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 08 - $8.0M; FY 09 - $8.5M; and FY10 - $8.0M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between $250,000 and $350,000 per fiscal year.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants or cooperative agreements depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. If the offeror wishes to restrict its white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b).

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance,  will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.


3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  

VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:

Technical POC:  1Lt Aaron J. Teter 
Telephone: (315) 330-7557

In accordance with AFFARS 5315.90, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<P>
Advance notice of this project has been previously published at FedBizOpps through the posting of draft solicitation documents, inclusive of a draft Statement of Work and responses to contractor submitted requests for clarification. These documents were posted using Reference-Number-SSA-TSRP-(VOIP)-2006, and can be accessed at: <U>http://www.fbo.gov/spg/SSA/DCFIAM/OAG/Reference%2DNumber%2DSSA%2DTSRP%2D%28VOIP%29%2D2006/Synopsis.html</U>. Interested parties are encouraged to access these previous draft postings to familiarize themselves with the general requirements of the SSA under TSRP.

<P>

<P>
This notice is NOT A SOLICITATION or request for information.

Any information received in response to this notice will not be considered, and will be discarded.
<P>
<B>Synopsis of Requirements :</B>
<P>
The Social Security Administration (SSA) will replace its current Private Branch eXchange (PBX) telephony systems at specified sites with an Enterprise Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony solution, to support current and future requirements and the transition to Internet Protocol (IP) Telephony, hereafter known as the Telephone Systems Replacement Project (TRSP). The SSAs current PBX systems have limitations that impact productivity, efficiency, and cost in completing the Agencys mission.  In addition, there are concerns about the technical support for the existing PBX systems.  The target Enterprise VoIP architecture for the replacement system will utilize centralized call processing equipment located on Agency premises and several premise based systems, employing an Agency-provided data network infrastructure for transport.  This VoIP system architecture will provide greater functionality, interoperability, flexibility, survivability and a consolidated operational and management infrastructure.  It will be a robust, scalable, and flexible infrastructure that will provide significant business value in the near term, and will best position the Agency for the future.  The solution will deliver a single logical system that will provide telephone, Automatic Call Distribution (ACD), Automated Attendant (AA), Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and voicemail services across Agencys Headquarters and Field Office organizations, including 10 regional offices, 6 Program Service Centers, and over 1500 Field Offices, to name a few.  
<P>
The TSRP solution will consist of contractor provided hardware, software, and professional services to install and integrate the TSRP solution with the SSAs GFE, and remove the end of life telephony systems.  The GFE include the Agencys Wide Area Network (WAN) and Local Area Network (LAN) network infrastructure, and WAN and PSTN transport facilities and services. The Contractor will provide a migration path from the existing key system voice platform to support telephony and other voice communication sessions among people who are geographically dispersed though an innovative, comprehensive solution that combines, voice, video, and data applications on the Agencys existing data network infrastructure. TSRP will also include a Contractor provided Managed Services component for addressing the management, control, administration and maintenance of the enterprise VoIP solution.  These services will entail close cooperation with the Agencys current Information Technology (IT) groups, as well as the Agencys GFE and provider(s).  
<P>
The upcoming TSRP solicitation will fully specify the following contractor provided supplies and services:
<P>
1.	Connectivity between hardware, software, and telecommunications equipment.
<P>
2.	A single logical telephony system for the Agencys existing Field Offices. 
<P>
3.	Multiple single site telephony systems for some of the Agencys large sites and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) locations.
<P>
4.	Specifications required to engineer, furnish, integrate, install, test, and place in service (cutover) the TSRP solution, as well as support of the System equipment.
<P>
5.	Training of government personnel.
<P>
6.	Ongoing on-site maintenance and management with trained and certified individuals.
<P>
7.	Removal and disposal of obsolete telephony equipment from the Agencys offices.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>With this announcement, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District issues a pre-solicitation notice for the following project:  hydraulic dredging at Westport River & Harbor, Massachusetts. This solicitation is a 100% Small Business Set-A side. The NAICS code for the work described below is 237990 with a size standard of $18,500,000.00. The estimated cost of this work is between $500,000 and $1,000,000. The Westport River & Harbor is located in the Town of Westport, Massachusetts, on the sh ore of Buzzards Bay, bordering Rhode Island.   The harbor is a coastal estuary with an inlet opening south into Buzzards Bay between a barrier beach to the east and head land to the west. The harbor has general depths of 8 to 15 feet below mean lower low w ater (mllw), while the entrance has a controlling depth of about 6 feet below mllw.  The proposed project consists of dredging an entrance channel, 9 feet mlw by 150 to 200 feet wide, through the inlet to Westport Harbor (from RN12 to GC-23).  The channel would connect deep water in Buzzards Bay with deep water in the harbor, a distance of about 9,700 feet, of which only three areas, totaling about 4,550 feet of channel require dredging. Disposal site is a 2,400-foot long section of Horseneck Beach located between 1,600 and 4,000 feet east of the inlet. The required approach is to place about 19,500 cubic yards of clean sand onto the Town-owned portion of Horseneck Beach, and working the material on the beach to establish appropriate beach profiles.  A one-f oot allowable over depth and side slopes of one on three are included in the channel design and quantities. Sediment Characteristics:     The results of grain size analysis indicated that the proposed dredged material is composed of approximately 99% sand.  The sandy material is dominated by fine and medium grained sands.  Sea State Conditions:  from October through January, northerly winds result in calm waters inside marker RN-8.  Strong southerly winds may produce 5 foot swells.  Outgoing tide may produce  currents up to 4 knots.     Storm events may result in swells greater than 5 feet. The environmental dredging window for this project permits work from October 1, 2007 through January 31, 2008. The solicitation shall be made available via Internet on or a bout August 14, 2007. To download the solicitation, prospective contractors shall register with and download the solicitation from www.fedteds.gov. Registration instructions are available at this website. Amendments, if any, will be available at this Inter net site. Neither telephonic, mailed, nor faxed requests for solicitation documents will be accepted. All responsible Small Business concerns may submit a bid, which will be considered by the New England District.

<DESC>The Munitions Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Eglin AFB, FL BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR TACTICAL CAPABILITIES FOR BATTLEFIELD AIRMAN AND SECURITY FORCE, MNK-BAA-06-0003 is hereby amended.  The following information is provided to expand the research area of Tactical Electrical Energy to include Personnel Protection Gear of the Occupants: 

Tactical Electrical Energy

The goal of this work is to perform component and vehicle research in the areas of:  advanced battery development, power management, and integrated vehicle design and body armor.  The objective is to develop highly mobile, quiet, lightweight, electrical vehicles for SOF, Security Forces, and Battlefield Airman personnel.  This work also includes the analysis, design, and assessment of electrical power systems for their use at deployed or remote locations.  The capability of deploying and moving electrical power on the battlefield is mission essential.  This research on mobile, electrical power should also be considered for use with other government agencies and organizations.  The efforts described may require individual component level development as well as fabrication to develop a mobile power capability.

Personnel Protection Gear

In support of the original goal of MNK-BAA-06-0003, it is also intended research should include the armor worn by the vehicle occupants.  Weight is a key factor in delivering capabilities to the battlefield, which includes the combined weight of the vehicle, supplies, and troops.  The design should take into account the ability to interchange vehicle body armor for personnel armor and visa verse.  The solution should be an integrated design.  Therefore, the objective is to include not only vehicle armor, but the armor carried by the troops and the design and fabric of the protective clothing that could incorporate the interchangeable armor.  There is also an objective to incorporate low power electrical sensors, devices, etc. into the fabric and armor plating to provide commanders with tactical C4ISR information about power management and system health status.  Care and design considerations should be taken with respect to tactical vehicles used by SOF troops.  New or modified equipment (material) should not inadvertently ground the vehicle or generate electrical interferences.

<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports research to understand, and ultimately prevent and/or treat, infectious and immune-mediated diseases that continue to threaten millions of lives each year.  The Government has a requirement to design and conduct a multi-site Phase II/III clinical trial for Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). NIAID intends to solicit this project utilizing full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541710. It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about June 15, 2007.  The objective of a contract will be to advance the field of clinical management for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) and to determine the optimal outpatient treatment strategy.  If selected the contractor would be expected to provide the scientific, technical, and managerial infrastructure, facilities, and other resources required to design and conduct a multi-site Phase II/III clinical trial.  In addition, the contractor must have the ability to determine the efficacy of off-patent oral antimicrobials and/or wound care for the treatment of outpatients with uncomplicated community-acquired skin and soft tissue infection in areas in the U.S, where the prevalence of CA-MRSA is high. An uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection is defined as the presence of wound infection, abscesses, folliculitis, cellulitis or erysipelas. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections are defined as the isolation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from the relevant disease process from subjects who have not been hospitalized within the previous fourteen (14) days. In order to preserve the efficacy of vancomycin and linezolid, evaluation of these two antimicrobials would not be supported under this effort. In addition, clinical trials of invasive diseases (e.g., bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomylitis or pneumonia) or clinical trials with hospitalized patients would not be supported under this contract. Clinical trials under this effort would require a minimum of two (2) and a maximum of five (5) clinical trial sites. Each clinical trial site, included would also be required to have access to one hundred and twenty (120) subjects with skin and soft tissue infection every three (3) months to ensure enrollment of a minimum of forty (40) subjects every three (3) months.  It is estimated that a total effort of approximately 9.65 FTEs per year will be needed to accomplish this project.  
This RFP will be available electronically on/about April 15, 2006, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to award of a contract. NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. NO FACSIMILE AND E-MAIL TRANSMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED. See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

Opportunity Announcement

Modification 2 to Opportunity Announcement:

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has received questions regarding this opportunity announcement.  However, due to the general nature of the information required for responses to this announcement, no further technical information will be made available at this stage.  Although there is no indication of when Xcel will be issuing a RFP for the Solar? Rewards Program, when an RFP is issued, additional technical information will be provided.  For the solar project developers who respond to this announcement, the responses will be held on file at NREL.

The purpose of this opportunity announcement is for DOE and NREL to select two or three interested solar project developers.  As stated in the opportunity announcement, the selected developers will be given more detailed site information, and a site tour, for their use in preparing a more detailed proposal for submission to Xcel, once an RFP is released by Xcel.

Also as stated in the announcement, only the following information is required:
 
Past Experience. DOE and NREL will consider past experience in financing, designing, installing, owning, operating, and maintaining PV systems of similar size and complexity. The developer must have experience with a minimum of one installed and operating PV system of at least 500 kW. If the developer forms a joint venture or other teaming arrangement, these same considerations will be applied to the parties to the joint venture or teaming arrangement cumulatively. Additional response information may be included such as: 

(1)       More extensive experience with PV projects, including projects under 
power purchase agreements. 
(2)       Experience with Xcel Energy's Solar*Rewards Program.
(3)       Experience with Federal government projects.

Pricing Approach. Explain the approach for minimizing the SO-REC price and the price of electricity generated.

Financial Capability. Provide verifiable information demonstrating that the developer is in sound financial condition and has the ability to secure the necessary financing to meet the project's requirements now and in the future. The developer's financial capability will be reviewed for stability and adequacy to meet its long-term capital and cash needs to own, operate, and maintain the PV system. If the developer is selected to submit its proposal to Xcel and plans to secure financing from an outside source, an official letter from the financier confirming the financial arrangement will be required. 

PV Supply. If the developer is selected to submit its proposal to Xcel, the developer must provide a letter from its PV supplier and/or manufacturer substantiating the availability of PV modules for the project.

The response due date remains unchanged at August 3, 2007.

==================

June 6, 2007

Summary:

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) located in Golden, Colorado and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Golden Field Office (GO) are seeking opportunities to collaborate with a solar energy project developer for the purpose of developing an on-site solar electricity generation project at NREL. Development of this project is encouraged by a utility incentive program that was implemented in Colorado for purposes of compliance with Colorado's Renewable Energy Standard (RES). The Colorado Legislature recently increased the RES to require higher percentages of solar electricity generation by qualifying retail utilities. Though not subject to the RES, DOE and NREL are customers of Xcel Energy, Inc. (Xcel), a major U.S. investor-owned electric and natural gas utility with regulated operations in Colorado that is subject to compliance with the RES. Prospective developers responding to this Opportunity Announcement must be willing to prepare and submit a proposal to Xcel Energy's Solar*Rewards Program as a third-party developer for a customer-sited photovoltaic (PV) system at NREL. 

Project Structure:

DOE and NREL expect the developer to be capable of designing, financing and installing a ground-mounted PV system that can produce a minimum of 1,200 MWH per year. The system will be located on Federal government property at NREL's South Table Mountain (STM) site in Golden, Colorado. Approximately five acres of land will be available for the project. In addition, DOE and NREL expect the developer to own, operate and maintain the PV system for at least twenty years. In addition to the ground-mounted system, other opportunities may exist to develop roof-mounted PV projects on existing DOE-owned buildings at NREL, as well as on buildings currently in the design phase for which construction has not yet begun. 

Based on prior Xcel Request for Proposals (RFP), DOE and NREL anticipate that the financial structure for the project will include the following elements: (1) a 20-year power purchase agreement for DOE to purchase the entire electricity output of the PV system; (2) a one-time rebate payment from Xcel to the developer in the amount of $2.00 per watt for up to a maximum of 100 kW per system, payable upon confirmation of the Commercial Operation Date; (3) monthly payments from Xcel to the developer for all Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SO-RECs) generated for a 20-year period; and (4) any Federal or state tax credits for which the developer may be eligible. 

 
Prospective developers must be willing to enter into specific agreements with various parties which may be involved in the successful execution of this project. These agreements include the following: (1) a no-cost easement with DOE for access to the land; (2) a power purchase agreement with the Western Area Power Administration (Western) for the electricity generated by the ground-mounted PV system; (3) a site use agreement with the NREL Division of the Midwest Research Institute for installation, operation and maintenance activities conducted at the site; (4) a third-party rebate contract with Xcel; and (5) a third-party SO-REC contract with Xcel for all SO-RECs generated.

Project Selection and Timing:

While no announcement has yet occurred for 2007, DOE and NREL expect Xcel to issue another RFP for customer-sited PV generating facilities above 100 kW and up to 2 MW DC under Xcel's Solar*Rewards Program. Typically, Xcel provides very short response times for proposal preparation after an RFP is released. In order to allow more time for developers to prepare a proposal for submission to Xcel, DOE and NREL intend to identify solar project developers prior to Xcel's release of an RFP. Because of the financial incentives offered through Xcel's Solar*Rewards Program, future execution of this project depends on the developer's proposal being selected by Xcel under an upcoming RFP.

Based on responses to this Opportunity Announcement, DOE and NREL intend to select two or three solar project developers. The selected developers will be given more detailed site information and a site tour for their use in preparing a more detailed proposal for submission to Xcel. DOE has begun an environmental assessment (EA) for this project pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. The EA will be completed by DOE at no cost to the developer. DOE and NREL will allow the developers flexibility to decide the level of effort they wish to put into proposal preparation prior to issuance of an RFP by Xcel. All proposal preparation and development costs are to be borne by the developer. At such time as Xcel issues an RFP, DOE and NREL will ask the developers to submit their final proposals to DOE and NREL for review. Based on this review, DOE and NREL will cooperate to select one developer who will then submit its proposal to Xcel. All selection decisions will be final and are within the sole discretion of DOE and NREL. 

Based on past experience, DOE and NREL expect that Xcel's process will be highly competitive and their selection criteria will be based largely on SO-REC price. Prospective developers are encouraged to create a financial structure for the project aimed at minimizing the SO-REC price and the price of electricity generated.

 
Response Requirements:

Response length is limited to two, double-sided pages, 8.5 in. x 11 in., with no smaller than 12 point font and 1 inch margins. 

Responses shall include the following information:

Past Experience. DOE and NREL will consider past experience in financing, designing, installing, owning, operating, and maintaining PV systems of similar size and complexity. The developer must have experience with a minimum of one installed and operating PV system of at least 500 kW. If the developer forms a joint venture or other teaming arrangement, these same considerations will be applied to the parties to the joint venture or teaming arrangement cumulatively. Additional response information may be included such as: 

(1)	More extensive experience with PV projects, including projects under power purchase agreements. 
(2)	Experience with Xcel Energy's Solar*Rewards Program.
(3)	Experience with Federal government projects.

Pricing Approach. Explain the approach for minimizing the SO-REC price and the price of electricity generated. 
 
Proposed PV System Technical Specifications. Describe the type of PV cells, efficiency, mounting, tracking method if used, interconnection plan, and recommended provisions to minimize PV system visibility (including light reflection) for the ground-mounted system. 

Financial Capability. Provide verifiable information demonstrating that the developer is in sound financial condition and has the ability to secure the necessary financing to meet the project's requirements now and in the future. The developer's financial capability will be reviewed for stability and adequacy to meet its long-term capital and cash needs to own, operate, and maintain the PV system. If the developer is selected to submit its proposal to Xcel and plans to secure financing from an outside source, an official letter from the financier confirming the financial arrangement will be required. 

PV Supply. If the developer is selected to submit its proposal to Xcel, the developer must provide a letter from its PV supplier and/or manufacturer substantiating the availability of PV modules for the project.

<DESC>This amendment deletes the requirement for the contractor to have a secret clearance. This combined sources sought/synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  A contract may not be awarded as a result of this combined sources sought/synopsis.  The US Army Contracting Agency, Contracting Center of Excellence (CCE) at the Pentagon, on behalf of US Army, HQDA Office Chief, Public Affairs, intends to procure technical support and subject matter expertise in supporting the development, coordination, integration, synchroniza tion, implementation and assessment of an external strategic communications program that powerfully communicates the Armys strategic messages to key audiences.  The Armys communications challenges involve many diverse audiences and the Army must clearly communicate the purpose of the Army, highlight Army and Soldier achievements, portray the Army and Soldiers in a positive light and keep the American public connected to the American Soldier.  Accomplishing these efforts will effectively support the Armys  strategic goals of Maintaining Public Support which can be directly tied to positive Recruiting and Retention of the Army as a small business set-aside or under full and open procedures.  Only small businesses are to submit capability packages.  Intereste d small businesses that are certified and qualified as a small business concern in NAICS code 541820 with a size standard of $6.5 million are encouraged to submit their capability packages outlining their experience in the following key areas or tasks.  Re spondents are requested to submit a capability statement that clearly addresses their corporate capabilities to deliver required services. The capability statement is not to exceed 30 pages.  Respondents must answer the following questions in their capabil ity statements. (1)	What technical expertise and past performance experience does the contractor have in performing high-end, corporate level strategic and tactical public relations activities and missions?  Specifically, what experience does the contractor have in creati ng and executing integrated outreach programs?  Include the contract number, customer, contract value, type of contract, period of performance, prime contractor, brief description of services, Contracting Officers Representative (COR) name COR email addre ss and the CORs telephone number.   (2)	What technical expertise and past performance experience does the contractor have in pitching and securing media coverage of events?  Also, what expertise does the contractor have in creatively developing a media hook to secure a story in print or broa dcast media on a particular subject?  Specifically, what kind of media contacts and relationships does the contactor have at the national level and for non-traditional/niche media (culturally-diverse, entertainment, sports, etc)? Describe your professional network that will enable you to maintain a corporate culture in a variety of locations around the country.  What specific tools and resources does the contractor use to measure and analyze the effectiveness of Public Relations pr ograms? If at least two responsible small business concerns are determined by the Government to be capable of performing this requirement based on an evaluation of the capability packages submitted by 10:00 AM 23 July 2007 EST, the requirement will be solicited as  a 100% set-aside for small business concerns.  If capability packages are not received from at least two responsible small business concerns by the response date or if the Government determines that no small businesses are capable of performing this requi rement based upon an evaluation of the capability packages submitted this requirement will be solicited under full and open procedures.  No other synopsis will be posted for this requirement. To assist us in maintaining a list of interested small businesse s for this potenti al procurement, please provide your companys name, point of contact (POC), address, phone number, and business size under the above NAICS code to the POC for this procurement Adam Kitay.  A Firm Fixed Price Contract is anticipated.  The period of performa nce for this requirement is a 12 month base period with three one year options.

<DESC>We are conducting market research looking for companies that could provide Nursery Grow Bags, in Ground, 10" wide with a Root Trapper Base, 15" tall, that would be constructed of knit fabric, durable nylon type material with optimum hole diameter of 5/64 of an inch.  This allows fibrous roots to grow outside of the bags to take advantage of water and nutrients, but restricts root from getting to large by girdling them and promotes a fibrous root system inside of the bag.  The bottom would be laminated material that roots would not penetrate.  These bags need to be UV Rated so they will stand the elements for up to 5-6 years.  Polypropylene or ground fabric bags will not be acceptable.  We are looking to purchase approximately 10,000 grow bags.  If you can provide a similar product please respond to this Sources Sought no later than 8/13/07.  

Please state your business size when replying to this Sources Sought Notice.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) located in Saint Petersburg, FL, intends to establish a fixed price purchase order to estimate reef fish by catch on bottom longline vessels in the Gulf of Mexico via electronic monitoring system, to be utilized by the SESFC on a sole source basis from Marine Resources Assessment Group (MRAG) Americas Inc., St. Petersburg, FL based on the following:  1) MRAG and AMR are the only known vendors who have performed the proposed work.  There are no other known groups of entities qualified to conduct the work; 2) MRAG and AMR have conducted numerous electronic monitoring studies through subcontracts with Archipelago Marine Research, Inc. (AMR) to evaluate the use of electronic monitoring systems in commercial fisheries; 3) MRAG and AMR have been involved in using video technology to monitor the longline fishery of halibut in the North Pacific; 4) MRAG and AMR have been involved in a number of Canadian fisheries, particularly the sablefish trap and longline fishery; 5) Electronic monitoring technology has also been provided for the British Columbia commercial Dungeness crab fishery, and is now a standard part of their monitoring program; 6) A 2002 pilot project with British Columbia waters comparing with electronic monitoring system with conventional at-sea indicates electronic monitoring may be appropriate to replace or complement at-sea observer program; 7) MRAG and AMR have been successful with testing and implementing electronic monitoring systems in many parts of the world; 8) The main species targeted by bottom longline in the Gulf of Mexico is red grouper.  As red grouper is monitored with a quota, there is a good chance the quota will be met before the end of the year.  Should the quota be met and funds are not in place, establishment of the project and collection of data could not occur until January 2008.



The objective of this requirement is to estimate reef fish by catch on bottom longline vessels in the Gulf of Mexico via electronic monitoring system.

The Contractor will provide 6-8 video monitoring systems on various vessels during a 1-2 month period.  The details of the system will potentially consist of: 1) Operating system and data storage consisting of a lockable, tamper-proof box contains the operating system, data storage components, and power supplies for the video camera and peripheral vessel sensors.  The two primary components in the control box are the video computer and data logging computer; 2) User interface consisting of a small monitor and keyboard provide basic system status information and allow user input; 3) GPS receiver; 4) Winch sensor; 5) Hydraulic pressure transducer; and 6) Cameras (2 to 5).  The exact specification of the system may be modified depending on nuances of data to be collected.  The contractor will set up systems on specific vessels and download data upon completion of a fishing trip.  The system will record species caught, number of hooks, location, depth, date, time, and disposition of released organisms.  The contractor will analyze electronic video monitoring data and provide SEFSC and SERO personnel with results.  SEFSC and SERO will compare data collected by the electronic monitoring system and NMFS observers and prepare a final report. 

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses.  However, all responses received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Responses can be faxed to Carey Marlow at (816) 274-6923 or submitted via email to carey.m.marlow@noaa.gov .  Interested parties should include, in writing the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities, qualifications, and expertise.  Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the following criteria: 1) Demonstration of ability to deploy 6-8 systems on various vessels over a 1-2 month period as described herein; 2) Demonstration of ability to conduct outreach to the fishing industry as described herein; 3) Demonstration of ability to perform data analysis and evaluate feasibility of using video monitoring in the Gulf of Mexico longline fleet; 4) Demonstration of ability to present findings via various methods (i.e., reports, presentations, etc.);  The applicable NAICS code is 541712.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), located in Miami, FL, intends to establish a fixed price purchase order for the creation of electronic (pdf) files of all material associated with  the Western Atlantic Turtle Symposium (WATS) forums, including national reports, databases, proceedings, recommendations, and annotated literature reviews, on a sole source basis from WIDECAST Inc., Beaufort, NC based on the following:  1) The first WATS convened in Costa Rica (July 17-22, 1983) and the second followed four years later in Puerto Rico (October 12-16, 1987).  The reports and databases that comprise the National Reports and Proceedings of these symposia are an important part of the historical literature in the Wider Caribbean Region.  They feature data on the distribution and abundance of nesting, as well as datasets available at the time related to trade and commerce, sea turtle landings, bycatch, and other threats (predation, poaching, and erosion).  Legislative text is often presented, and some national reports have very useful anecdotal information on public views towards sea turtle conservation and status a generation ago.  The WIDECAST library includes original copies of the four primary WATS proceedings volumes (Bacon et al. 1984 a,b,c; Ogren 1989), including Volume III of the 1983 meeting which comprised of national reports from 43 governments and a follow-up 36 national reports submitted to WATS II; 2)  WIDECAST holds the only known complete set of original national documents and, as such, is in a unique position to make this data available to a new generation of researchers, conservationists, managers and policymakers; 3) WIDECAST will create electronic (pdf) files of all material associated with the WATS forums, including national reports, databases, proceedings, recommendations, and annotated literature reviews, and post them to the Internet for easy public access; 4) WIDECAST is uniquely capable of undertaking this project not only because of the archived WATS material available in its library, but through its extensive regional network the national reports will be returned to their original authors for validation; 5) WIDECAST holds the only known complete nesting site database for the Wider Caribbean Region, having mapped more than 2000 nesting grounds that will serve as a baselayer for creating maps (not included in the original volumes) of all (geo-referencable) WATS-associated data.  

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses.  However, all responses received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Responses can be faxed to Carey Marlow at (816) 274-6923 or submitted via email to carey.m.marlow@noaa.gov .  Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications; and any additional supporting literature.  Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the following criteria: 1) Demonstrated technical ability to successfully provide the required digitization of the WATS database and proceedings as described herein; 2) Demonstrated ability to provide original copies of the four primary WATS proceedings volumes, including Volume III of the 1983 meeting which is comprised of national reports from 43 governments and a follow-up 36 national reports submitted to WATS II;  3) Demonstrated ability to create electronic files of all material associated with the WATS forums, including national reports, databases, proceedings, recommendations, and annotated literature reviews; The applicable NAICS code is 519120.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 

Office of Personnel Management as the HR Line of Business Managing Partner
Entrance on Duty Solution
1.  Background:
The President?s Management Agenda (PMA) requires Federal agencies to expand the use of electronic government (e-Gov) to improve efficiency and enhance the quality of services provided to citizens.  Under the PMA, several lines of business have been established to consolidate, improve and streamline business processes across the Executive Branch.

The Human Resources Line of Business (HR LOB) initiative was launched in 2004 to support the vision articulated in the President?s Management Agenda.  The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is the managing partner for the HR LOB.

The HR LOB is expected to help the Federal Government realize the potential of electronic government by significantly enhancing human resources service delivery within the Executive Branch.  The HR LOB Concept of Operations (CONOPS) proposes a near-term service delivery model where some highly transactional and administratively intense HR services move from the agencies to HR shared service centers.  This approach will allow agencies to increase their focus on core mission activities and the strategic management of human capital, with HR shared service centers delivering the HR transactional services in an efficient and cost-effective manner focused on customer service quality.

The HR LOB Program is developing Enterprise Architecture in compliance with the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) guidelines as prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  To date the HR LOB and its member agencies have developed four of the five reference models that make up the FEA.

One of those models, the Business Reference Model (BRM), describes a governmentwide view of the sub-functions, processes and activities that agencies perform to deliver HR services to employees of the Federal Government.  ?Entrance on Duty? (EOD) falls within the BRM sub-function ?Staff Acquisition? and includes the onboarding of agencies? new employees and federal transfers.  HR LOB Business Reference Model and Target Requirements Shared Service Centers are available at http://www.opm.gov/egov/.

The HR LOB, in concert with Federal agencies, has developed detailed requirements for a standard governmentwide approach to EOD that is described in the EOD Concept of Operations Report (EOD CONOPS).  This report is attached.  The CONOPS describes an EOD solution from the following perspectives:


Business capability description ? this description includes:
    1. Detailed task-level EOD process map and task descriptions
    2. Functional requirements for an EOD solution
    3. Overview of EOD-related data required by the employee and the agency
    4. Identification of the service components based on the FEA definitions
    5. EOD performance measures
    6. Service Delivery Model describing access to services
    7. Acquisition Approach Strategy

The results are compliant with OMB?s Federal Enterprise Architecture guidelines.  More importantly, the EOD CONOPS describes a solution that moves toward realization of the HR LOB enterprise architecture.
This RFI is being issued to gather information about solutions that meet the functionality outlined in the CONOPS report and make it available to the agencies interested in acquiring EOD solutions.
2.  Description of Information Requested:
Note:  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  No solicitation will be issued at this time. This RFI will be used to consolidate vendor information based on a comparison to the EOD CONOPS report.  This information will be consolidated and made available to agencies.

Capability Statements must reflect the vendor?s ability to provide an EOD solution with respect to the following six major BRM activities associated with Entrance on Duty: 

1.	Extending the job offer.
2.	Responding to a job offer.
3.	Initiating pre-employment processes.
4.	Certifying compliance with pre-employment requirements.
5.	Bringing the selectee on board.
6.	Closing out the case file.

EOD, for this RFI, specifically refers to the automated collection and distribution of initial employment and work information for Federal employees and contractors.  It includes notifications to relevant Federal staff, the exchange of data between pre-employment certification providers, and communication around provisioning.  It does not include recruiting, the content and development of orientation or delivery of new employee orientation nor does it include socialization of the employee.  In the Federal Government, agencies are typically collecting information for a new or transferring employee through activities that require the prospective employee to complete forms that contain redundant information.  Paper forms are reviewed and organized; some are manually input into a system and others are simply filed in a hard-copy folder for reference.

Vendors responding to this RFI must provide:

1.	Company Information.  Vendors will provide a one page summary about their company.  Included in the summary will be:
    a. The company name and address
    b. Contact information for the EOD solution information
    c. Size of the company in terms of revenue and employees
    d. Years in business
    e. Type of company
2.	Understanding of Business Need.  Vendors will state the business need fulfilled by their solution in the Federal environment.
3.	Functional Overview.  Vendors will provide a description of how their EOD solution works for their clients, including a process overview.
4.	Requirements Self-Evaluation.  Vendors will fill out a self-evaluation tool for each requirement found in the EOD CONOPS.  (See the attached excel spreadsheet).
5.	Public Sector Experience.  Vendors will summarize EOD implementations in the Federal, state or local government environments.  Each reference will be 1 page or less, with the total number of pages being less than 10 pages.  Include in the references:
    a. Implementation date
    b. Current status of the solution
    c. Reference name and contact information
    d. Number of new employees served per year
6.	Technical Architecture.  Provide a summary of the technical architecture for the EOD solution presented in this RFI.  Include in the summary:
    a. Web services approach and use
    b. How the solution will leverage existing technology
    c. Architectural direction including a point of view on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
7.	Federal Government contracting vehicles.  Vendors will provide contract information on any Federal contracting agreements for which they have qualified.

Additionally, OPM requests that vendors provide information about their pricing structures and rough order-of-magnitude pricing (e.g., including software licenses, consulting rates, hosting fees) for their solutions, given their understanding of the requirements stated in this RFI.  

3.  How to Respond:
Responses to this RFI must be received by 3:00 PM on August 10, 2007.

Vendors meeting the above requirements shall submit a written Capability Statement not to exceed twenty (25) pages.  Recommended format for EOD responses:
1.	Introduction (Corporate Overview) up to 2 pages
2.	Understanding of Business Need	up to 2 pages
3.	Functional Summary/Process overview up to 4 pages

If time permits, and depending on the number of responses, individual vendors MAY be contacted for a product demonstration.  The Federal Government will not pay for any costs associated with the demonstration of any software products or any written response to this notice under this request for information announcement.

This is a sources sought notice only.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the government on its eventual acquisition approach.  Respondents will not be notified of any results derived from a review of the information provided; however, information gathered may be utilized for technical and acquisition purposes.  The Federal Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice nor pay for any information submitted by respondents.

All responses to this notice are to be submitted via e-mail in Microsoft Word format to:
	
Chris Atkins CLATKINS@OPM.GOV And John Rekstad JAREKSTA@OPM.GOV

<SUBJECT>R -- FTC REDRESS SERVICES - SOURCES SOUGHT
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-FTC-2007-BAZ-RDSS-0001
<RESPDATE>081707
<CONTACT>Bret Zieman, Contracting Officer, Phone 202/326-3216, Fax 202/326-3529, Email bzieman@ftc.gov - Bret Zieman, Contracting Officer, Phone 202/326-3216, Fax 202/326-3529, Email bzieman@ftc.gov
<DESC>FTC Redress Services - Sources Sought Description: This announcement is not a request for proposal or quote and no award will be made from this announcement, it is a market research tool only.


1.  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Acquisition Branch is issuing this sources sought notification as part of its market research analysis to obtain a better understanding of how many sources there are that can provide redress administration services. It is anticipated that the resulting requirement from the sources sought and market research produced will result in the issuance of a performance-based services contract supporting redress administration (claims administration and check distribution) relating to the FTC's consumer protection mission.  


2.  Description of redress administration services:  

The contractor will be required to: 

A.  Operate efficient and cost effective claims administration, which permits redress class members world-wide to receive monetary disbursement from defendant-funded settlements. Systems must be scalable to meet current and future program requirements.

B.  Provide the FTC access to matter-specific class member and financial transaction information through standard and ad hoc reports.

C.  Provide injured class members with easily accessible points of contact through consistent, timely and professional responses to their inquiries. 


Known Goal: BCPs goal is to complete a redress distribution in as many cases as possible within eighteen (18) months after payment of the monetary judgment and to close all redress matters within thirty (30) months unless special circumstances prevent completion within this time period, such as the payment of the redress funds in installments over an extended time period or insufficient claimant data.  


3. General Background: The FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection (BCP) enforces various statutes enacted to protect consumers against unfair, deceptive or fraudulent business practices.  The FTC's litigation may result in the award of redress money that is to be returned to consumers affected by the challenged practices. Disbursement of money in the redress fund is made pursuant to a distribution plan either approved by the court or the administrative law judge or delegated to the FTCs discretion. In some cases, if direct payment to consumers or indirect restitution is not practical, the redress money is used to fund a consumer education program as a remedy.   A major component of the redress administration process requires management of the monetary award in order to protect and enhance this asset fund.
The Redress Administration Office (RAO), which is part of BCPs Division of Planning and Information, is responsible for administering and coordinating redress activities.  RAOs objective is to return funds to approved claimants as expeditiously as possible given the circumstances of the particular case.  To facilitate this, the RAO assigns matters to a specific contractor by issuing a task order (Delivery Order.)  After the Delivery Order is issued, the FTC shall provide all relevant claimant information in its possession, a copy of the proposed distribution plan, and any approval of the plan by the court or administrative body awarding the judgment.  The distribution plan shall detail which of the following combination of services are required for each assigned case: money management; claims processing and eligibility; redress distribution; consumer education; final accounting; and, reporting and record keeping.  


The RAO or case manager (the FTC attorney or investigator assigned to the matter) shall provide instructions to the contractor concerning the mechanics of each case specific distribution plan.  As a general rule, the distribution plan provides that fund administration expenses shall be paid from the redress fund and that each matter shall include money management, final accounting, along with reporting and record keeping.


4. Historical Information: Currently, the RAO provides oversight to two contractors managing approximately 80 open Delivery Orders and $85 million dollars.  Between October 2002 and July 2007, the contractors performed approximately 250 distributions -- mailing 400 million redress checks amounting to $460 million dollars.  

Note: One of the ongoing questions related to the Delivery Order and amount of funds changing hands during this process is the issue of proper Contractor Bonding and applicable Insurance requirements.  We would appreciate any comments on the issue surrounding Bonding and Insurance and how to best to mitigate the Risk Management portion of the Redress contract.


5. Information Gathering: If you are interested and/or can share current information about these services, please respond to the individual identified in this announcement no later than August 17, 2007, with the following information:

A. Your Central Contractor Registry (CCR) information;
B. Your GSA Schedule information (if applicable) but not a requirement at this time;
C. Current Government contracts for this service?  If so please send us a listing that includes: Contract Number; Contracting Officer name, email and phone; Brief description of services being performed; 
D. If you have and would like to share sample Statements of Work/Services we will gladly review them while forming our DRAFT RFP.


6. The anticipated timeline of events including our Market Research is as follows:
a.  Sources sought (August 1st - 17th)
b.  Potentially Post DRAFT RFP for Industry Review (August 24th -September 14th)
c.  Industry comments due (September 14th)

<DESC>Point of contact for this action is Ms. McCoy Klink, telephone (703) 704-0035, email mccoy.klink@us.army.mil. Please provide all information no later than Friday, 3 August 2007. Description - The Government is seeking potential offerors for the rapid development and deployment of a rifle-mountable rangefinder for the Grenade Launcher Module (GLM), XM320. Vendors are requested to provide information to the U.S. Army Product Manager  Soldier Sensors and Lasers (PM SSL). The GLM will provide an improved capability to range and engage targets from 31 to 350 meters day and night. The GLM grenadier will have the capability to point to targets for other members of the squad to distances ou t to 800 meters.   Information on the XM320 can be found here: https://www.peosoldier.army.mil/factsheets/SW_IW_XM320.pdf For more images of an M4 carbine equipped with a GLM and associated day/night sight, please contact the POC above. Key requirements for the GLM pertaining to its associated rangefinder are that the subsystem provide a handheld range determination capability out to 800 meters with a measurement accuracy of  3 meters (T), or enhanced day and night fire control with rang efinder and ballistic solution capability integrated with the sight and fire control with range determination capability out to 2,000 meters with an accuracy of  1 meter (O). The rangefinder should at least provide repeatable and accurate range determinat ion capability for man-sized targets out to 200 meters and tank-sized targets out to 300 meters, but the rangefinder optimally will provide range determination capability to the objective range of 2,000 meters in ideal conditions.  The Armys intent is to procure a rangefinder for grenadiers that is mountable on an M4 carbine equipped with the GLM and associated day/night sight. The rangefinder should be backward-compatible with the legacy M203 grenade launcher system. The rangefinde r shall minimize weight impact to the Soldier. Size, weight, ergonomics and cost are critical to the rangefinder program. As such, PM SSL will consider any configuration which will fit on the limited MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail space on the M4 not alread y occupied by the GLM itself or the day/night sight, including stand-alone systems or systems integrated into other equipment (day sights, aiming lights, etc.) common to the M4 carbine.  The solution procured shall be a commercial-off-the-shelf or non-developmental item. There is a potential to procure 72,000 rangefinder systems beginning in FY09. The Government requests information on any materiel solutions for this rangefinder, including cost to develop, unit cost, and schedule including delivery date after receipt of order.  This is not a request for proposal or quotation. No solicitation document exists. This is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure these items, nor does the Army intend to award on the basis of this sources sought or otherwise pay f or the information requested.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS VIRGINIA (GINNY) SLAYTON @ 706-787-2019 OR virginia.slayton@us.army.mil  Potential sources sought to participate in the regional standardization of Casting Supplies: Cast Tape. A.	General Information:      Southeast Region (TRBO Reg 3&4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, Air Force medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of Casting Supplies: Cast Tape.   The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source (s) at the best possible price.  It is intended that standardized product be obtained through the D oD Prime Vendor Program.    The major facilities in the area includes:  MacDill AFB, FL, Eglin AFB, FL, Keesler AFB, MS, Fort Benning, GA, Fort Gordon, GA, Fort Stewart, GA, Fort Jackson, SC, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, FL, Naval Hospital Beaufort, SC, and Naval Hospital Pensacola,  FL.        This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor Program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, (DSCP) Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreemen t (DAPA) with the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) AND A separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendo rs to distribute their items.  This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is NOT a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime Vendor program please access the web site at: https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.     The agreement with incentive pricing will be based on a committed volume for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from the date of award with three (3) - 12 month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  A single award is intended in this project; ho wever, the Southeast acknowledges the possibility of a more than one vendor for this agreement.  Consideration will be based on best value to Government, based on evaluation of factors listed here. Anticipated award date is December 2007.  The evaluation w ill be based on technical/company, clinical/performance, and pricing factors.  The award will be determined utilizing Best Value/trade off criteria.               Point of Contact is Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019..   B.	Products & Performance Required    The Southeast Region is seeking product lines in the category of Casting Supplies: Cast Tape.  The yearly estimated total volume for Casting Supplies: Cast Tape is $127,670.93.  This is based on the historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period.   At the request of the Southeast Region MTFs vendors will provide on-site support, in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brand, types and p ackaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Offerors    DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) Point of Contact (Name and phone number, fax, email address, and Solicitation Number) to Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019 befor e 5:00 P.M. EDT on the date listed for closing on the FBO announcement in order to remain competitive.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified from the standardization process.      This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical/company criteria (Phase I), no charge product samples for clinical/performance evaluation (Phase II), and  submission of electronic best price offers (Phase III).  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Southeast Region that its initial submission responses, quo te and sample products actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before 5:00 P.M. EDT on the date listed for closing on the FBO announcement, should a problem oc cur with the first submission.  Vendors that fail to meet the re-submittal deadline will be disqualified from the standardization process.    D.  Evaluation Criteria    The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from nine Military Treatment facilities in the Southeast Region.  They are the final decision makers for this initiative.      Phase I.  Vendors will be required to the provide responses to the technical/company criteria outlined herein.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the solicitation response will be eliminated from the standardization process.  A Clinical Product T eam (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will review the responses and determine acceptability.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criter ia will be invited to participate in Phase II, the clinical/performance evaluation.      Phase II.  The TRBO will request specific product samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected MTFs.  Vendors are required to ship specific product samples and amounts directly to the MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar day s from the issue of the notice to ship samples.  Vendors products must be received in the MTFs by 5:00 P.M. EDT on the 14th calendar day at the participating MTFs in order to remain in the competitive process.  Each vendor participating in Phase II is adv ised to confirm receipt of delivery of product samples and provide confirmation receipt to the TRBO before 5:00 P.M. EDT on the 14th calendar day in order to remain competitive.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days.     Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert like scale with a 1-5 scoring format.  The scale descriptors are: one-not clinically acceptable and five-clinically superior product. The CPT has set a threshold of 3.0 for ac ceptability of product sample review for standardization.  Vendors, whose clinical /performance results are 2.9 and lower, will not be considered clinically acceptable and will be disqualified.  All clinical/performance questions weighted equally.   Phase III.  After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, the vendors in the clinical/performance evaluation group who met the minimum 3.0 threshold will be invited to participate in Phase III, pricing evaluations.  Vendors will b e asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Southeast Region, as well as to submit their best pricing offers in the event of more than one award.  Vendors will be given 14 calenda r days from the issue of notice to submit their best pricing offer.  Vendors who do not send their best pricing offers by 5:00 P.M. EDT on the 14th calendar day to the TRBO office will be disqualified.       Clinical/performance evaluation factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  Pricing will be evaluated based on the best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.   1.  Phase I:  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation Requirements In Phase I, the CPT wi ll review the following technical/company criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability.

<SUBJECT>D -- Forest Service Customer Contact Center
<DESC>The USDA Forest Service appreciates your review of Sections C, L and J of the Customer Contact Center (CCC) solicitation.  The Forest Service, in accordance with FAR Part 10 and 15.201, is releasing these draft documents for comment in order to obtain industry feedback on (1) the acquisition strategy, (2) the specificity and feasibility of the requirement including performance requirements, (3) the suitability of the proposal instructions, (4) the availability of reference information, and (5) any other industry concerns or questions. To maximize the effectiveness of this market research effort the Forest Service has identified key questions (listed below) where industry feedback is deemed most critical to the quality of the final solicitation.  Potential offerors are not obligated to respond specifically to these questions and may elect to respond with comments in addition to, or instead of, responding to these questions.  Furthermore, the Government may elect to respond to some, all, or none of the potential offeror comments in a written posting on FedBizOpps or through revisions to the solicitation.  The strategy adopted will align with the Government?s intent to (1) improve industry's understanding of Government requirements, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, (2) enhance the Government's ability to obtain quality supplies and services at reasonable prices, and (3) increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.
Industry comments are requested by July 13, 2007 at 09:00 a.m. EDT by email to the Forest Service Contracting Officer's Representative Ann McDonough at amcdonough@fs.fed.us.
It is the Government's intent to issue a request for quotations to GSA Schedule 70 (SIN 132.51) and progress through award of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) along the following schedule, which is subject to change at Government discretion:
Industry comments due on draft Sections C, L, and J requested by 07/13/07, 9:00 am EDT; Pre-proposal Bidder's Conference between 8/6 and 8/8/07; Final RFQ release by 08/27/07; Vendor questions due by 08/31/07; Proposals due 09/21/07; Contracting Officer to set Competitive Range by 10/22/07; Discussions between 11/05 and 11/09/07; Request Final Revised Proposals between 11/05 and 11/09/07; Final Revised Proposals due 6 business days after request; Award of BPA by 12/04/07; Issue BPA Call 0001 by 12/19/07

QUESTIONS FOR INDUSTRY:
The following questions are intended to allow the potential Offerors to comment on areas of specific interest for the Forest Service.  Additionally, and equally important, respondents should feel free to add any other comments that will help improve the quality of the Government's solicitation.
1.	ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:  Are the division of roles and responsibilities between the CCC Contractor and the Forest Service Information Solutions Organization (ISO) clear and well-defined?  If not, in what areas?  Are the lines of demarcation, in terms of ticket handling, between Tier 0/1 and Tier 2 and Tier 3 clear?
2.	TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP:  The Government's goal is to optimize the handling of customer tickets such that tickets of varying complexity are addressed by the support channel (e.g., Tier 0, Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3) best equipped and staffed to address the specific issue towards the goal of overall reduction of Total Cost to the Forest Service.  Does the distribution of ticket volume indicated in these documents maximally achieve that goal?  If not, how could the approach be improved? 
3.	RISK: Which requirements create the greatest risk to the CCC Contractor, why, and what mitigation is proposed?
4.	RADIO AND TELEPHONE SUPPORT:  What is the impact (positive and/or negative) of the inclusion of Radio and Telephone support in CCC Tier 0/1 support?
5.	REQUIREMENTS DEFINITION:  Where are the Government's requirements articulated in an overly restrictive or prescriptive form such that the Offeror's proposal is constrained in a manner damaging to the Government?
6.	INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS:  Are the Instructions to Offerors (Section L) clear?  Is the format of the Offeror's required response well-defined?  Are there Proposal elements that should be required that would allow the Offeror to better describe their solution?
7.	SCOPE:  The scope of the BPA is intentionally defined very broadly.  Where does this broad definition of scope pose the greatest cost and/or performance risk?
8.	TECHNOLOGY:  Are the technology/tool requirements overly prescriptive?  Do these requirements limit the Offeror's technical solution in a manner that negatively impacts the Forest Service?  Which technology/tool requirements (ACD, IVR, KMS, SAS, TMS, SGTS, etc.) are increasing cost in a manner disproportionate to the benefits?
9.	PERFORMANCE BASIS: Is the performance basis well described and optimal for aligning Forest Service and CCC Contractor incentives?  What are your suggestions to improve the award fee plan, while still putting some amount of revenue at risk?  Is the use of "swappable" SLAs and SLOs optimal?  Is there a better approach?
10.	PRICING: Does the approach of pricing Firm Fixed Price by Band optimally align Government and Contractor incentives and goals?
11.	SOFTWARE SUPPORT: What are the pros and cons of the Government's use of two categories to delineate primary responsibility for software support?
12.	MAC SUPPORT: What are the cost and complexity implications of including Macintosh computer support in scope?
13.	ASSUMPTIONS:  What are the particular areas of ambiguity or risk that are of greatest concern to your organization?  Please describe how these areas could be addressed to reduce the number of assumptions your company is forced to make and reduce the risk profile of this requirement from your company's perspective.
14.	COST DRIVERS: What requirements are driving costs in addition to actual contact volume?  Please identify these drivers and how the Forest Service can best address these issues with the goal of reducing overall costs and maintaining a predictable year over year service cost.
15.	INFORMATION GAPS:  Has the RFQ provided your company with enough detail (i.e., call volumes, etc.) for your company to produce a cost competitive bid?  If not please indicate what additional information your company would like to have in order to make the most competitive bid possible.
16.	TRANSITION GAPS:  What additional information would your company need in order to facilitate a smooth and successful Transition?
17.	FIRST CALL RESOLUTION:  Given that a stated goal of this solicitation is to increase the rate of first call resolution are there any requirements that would impede your organization?s ability to deliver high levels of first call resolution?
18.	TRANSITION TIMELINE:  Is ninety (90) days adequate for Transition and what are the associated risks with such a timeline?
19.	SOFTWARE SUPPORT:  Today's GOTS software is supported through a combination of the centralized EUSC helpdesk, Tier 2 ISO support, and individual help desks operated by GOTS application owners.  It is the Government's intent to migrate applications currently supported by individual help desks operated by GOTS application owners to the centralized CCC.  What are the implications of this migration to your technical and cost proposals?
20.	ORALS AND TECHNICAL DEMONSTRATION:  The Forest Service contemplates requesting Offerors in the Competitive Range to participate in a single day meeting per Offeror that includes (1) oral presentations of the Offeror's Technical Approach, (2) demonstrations of the Offeror's technical tools (such as the Knowledge Management System, Situational Awareness System, and Ticketing System) and (3) oral discussions of proposal weaknesses and deficiencies.  Please provide your comments on this approach.
21.	INCENTIVES FOR KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT: The Government's pricing model is intended to incentivize the Contractor to invest substantially in the development of Knowledge documents and a Knowledge Management System for its own agents as well as for use by Forest Service end users.  How does the Fixed Price Strategy accomplish this goal?
22.	TASK ORDER APPROACH:  The Government is contemplating issuing six (6) Calls against the BPA, one (1) for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2008; one (1) for each of four (4) succeeding fiscal years (2009 through 2012); and one (1) for the first six (6) months of Fiscal Year 2013 (to include transition to a succeeding contractor).  With the Offeror's Proposal the Government intends to request the Offeror's fixed Price Proposal for each band (as indicated in Section L.1, sub-section 3) for each period/Call, with the resulting best value award.  Please discuss pros and cons to this approach.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Small Business Administration has proposed to change how to calculate number of employees
<DESC>The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has proposed to change how it calculates a concern's number of employees in determining its small business size status.  SBA currently uses a rolling average number of employees for the immediately preceding 12 calendar months (13 CFR 121.106).  SBA's proposal would alter the period from a 12 month rolling average to a firm's average number of employees for its 3 immediately preceding completed calendar years.  This proposal will simplify the calculation of the average number of employees, reduce the burden on small businesses, and better define the size of a small business where number of employees is the measure for the size standard.  

You may read and/or download the proposed rule at <a href= "http://www.regulations.gov"> http://www.regulations.gov</a>.  You must submit your comments to SBA on or before September 25, 2007.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure the services of a contractor to work with the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) to assess the need for a trans-NIH research agenda for adherence research. It is expected that a single award will be made and the period of performance is expected not to exceed a period of 7 months from the date of award. The NAICS category is 541990.


STATEMENT OF WORK


Assessing the Need for a Trans-NIH Research Agenda for Adherence Research

Scope

1. Objective

At this time Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences (OBSSR) program staff plans to develop a funding opportunity announcement (FOA) to focus on adherence (for the purposes of this analysis this also includes compliance, concordance, persistence and maintenance) to preventive and medical regimens.  In conjunction with that activity, OBSSR staff is in the early stages of moving forward with an adherence research network.  Appropriate National Institutes of Health Institutes, Offices and Centers (IC) members will develop program goals for adherence research, such that the network can lead the field into more productive research that can be shown to improve adherence.  To start we want to identify and evaluate the current status of adherence research at the NIH.  In order to do that we need to:
1) Identify a cross-institute portfolio of behavioral research and other related activities in adherence; 2) Quantify the investment in this research; 3) Ascertain gaps in the existing research; 4) Identify outputs of the research; 5) Explore gaps in the research portfolio to help guide program staff in the decision making process for future, related activities such as conferences and research syntheses; and 6) Identify alternate resources and potential partners.

2. Context 

Providers generate more than three billion outpatient prescriptions annually1.  Additionally, according to the National Health Interview Survey (HIS), they provide counseling during 42% of all office visits.2  However, according to a recent Cochrane Collaborative report, ?People who are prescribed self-administered medications typically take less than half the prescribed doses.?3 The report goes on to conclude, ?Current methods of improving adherence for chronic health problems are mostly complex and not very effective, so that the full benefits of treatment cannot be realized.?

In FY2000, OBSSR, in partnership with twelve ICs, released an RFA on adherence to pharmacological therapy, RFA OD-00-006 http://obssr.od.nih.gov/Content/Research/Request_for_Applications_%28RFAs%29/AdherenceAwards.htm <http://obssr.od.nih.gov/Content/Research/Request_for_Applications_%28RFAs%29/AdherenceAwards.htm> .  Six R01s were funded http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-OD-00-006.html <http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-OD-00-006.html>. 

Other ICs, including NHLBI, NIMH and NIDA have funded adherence research.  However, IC programs have not undertaken an evaluation of program outcomes.


3. Key Question(s)
Questions to be addressed with this data collection 
-What are the characteristics of the NIH portfolio of adherence research funded over the last fifteen years?
- Can we comprehensively identify the results from the NIH research investment?
Other Questions for exploration
-Has NIH engaged in activities, other than funding research, with the explicit purpose of improved adherence?
 -What gaps exist within the research portfolio?
-Are there other organizations actively working to improve adherence through research sponsorship?

4. Requirements

A.	General Requirements

1.	Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services (except as otherwise specified herein) and perform the work set forth below.
2.	The Contractor shall be monitored by the Project Officer based on the timely submission of deliverables.
3.	The Contractor shall provide reports of progress on a monthly basis.  The format and details for these reports will be agreed upon at the first meeting between program staff and the Project Officer
4.	The following is a list of required tasks for this Task Order.  The tasks are listed sequentially; however, several tasks will be done concurrently, and some tasks will be continued throughout the entire Task Order period.

B.	Technical Requirement

The contractor, with input from program staff, will explore and identify the best data and methods to summarize and consolidate information on NIH?s investment in adherence research.  Minimally the contractor will identify NIH funding opportunity announcements (FOAs), information on funded projects, publications and other outputs for research grants and contracts.  The analysis will include FOAs published between 1992 and 2006.  The FOAs of interest will  be limited to those with at least one NIH IC listed as a sponsor, that focus in part, or as a whole, on the measurement and improvement in patient compliance, adherence, maintenance or persistence to therapies recommended by a healthcare provider.  The contractor shall explore all NIH data sources (e.g.; CRISP, CGAF, QVR/IMPACT, Medline, NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts) to ascertain the best sources of the necessary data. Non-NIH data sources will also be explored. Once relevant sources have been identified, the contractor will obtain study abstracts and other information to develop an analysis and summary of NIH?s investment in adherence research. 


Task 1.	Clarify Objectives, Issues, and Questions

The contractor shall meet with appropriate program and evaluation staff to discuss the objectives of the contract and any related project issues.  Specific topics to be discussed include:  evaluation goals, strategies, purpose, specific data requirements, data elements, software, timelines, and deliverables. In conjunction with the PO, the contractor will explore how we might comprehensively identify the results from the NIH research investment. 



Task 2.	Develop and Compile a Review of NIH FOAs relevant to Adherence

At a minimum, the contractor shall use NIH resources such as the NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts to develop an annotated database of FOAs released by NIH between the years 1992-2006 relevant to Adherence.  Tabular information with agreed upon data elements shall include date of release, a short summary (not to exceed five sentences) of the objectives, numbers of application and numbers of funded application. Other information of relevance may be included.   Additionally, the contractor will identify and ascertain the existence and value of other data sources (e.g., National Technical Information Service) for evaluating adherence activities.


Task 3. 	Develop a database of funded projects

The contractor shall identify all grants and contracts funded under Task 2 linked to an FOA and enter these into a database.   Data elements will include but not be limited to FOA, PI, Institution and a summary (not to exceed three sentences).  In addition, the contractor will develop an algorithm that identifies investigator initiated adherence research (e.g.: R01s), not associated with any FOA. These will identified included in the database


Task 4.		Identify outputs from the identified funded projects	

The contractor will review the relevant literature, obtained through a variety of search strategies (including, but not limited to using NIH databases) for outputs such as journal articles and textbooks generated by NIH funds identified in Task 3. The contractor will maintain a file of published abstracts.  The contractor will produce an annotated bibliography, with each publication linked to a grant/contract number. The database will use the standard Medline citation format for each individual article. The contractor and the PO will work to develop a format for this report. The contractor will categorize the nature of the studies.  Potential categories include:  conceptual, descriptive, or interventions (categorization strategies will be developed with program staff). This will likely be the first step in a more extensive program evaluation in which we expect to examine the impact of funded research. Data identified will be organized such that NIH?s resource investment in this field can be quantified.   The final decision on data sources and the organization of the data will be determined as the study progresses in conjunction with the project officer.

 The data will be provided in text and web-based formats that is platform-independent.


Task 5:	  	Review of Preliminary Runs and Revision of Data Collection Strategy

After preliminary runs of the data specified in Tasks 3 and 4 are performed by the Contractor, the Project Officer will review the data with the evaluation contractor staff and address data issues.  If data critical to the analyses are found to be missing, contractor staff will assess the feasibility and practicality of utilizing alternate strategies to fill in the gaps.

Task 6: 	Conclusions

The contractor, will comprehensively review results to assess how these data may be used to inform future adherence research by NIH and inform an evaluation of the impact of such research

Task 7:		Submit Final Datasets

An electronic copy of the final report (the structure of the final report will be agreed upon at the initial meeting), an executive summary, and the databases will be submitted to the Project Officer.

	C.	Delivery Schedule:  Work Products and Estimated Timeline
It is estimated that this project shall be completed in 24 weeks.  For purpose of this schedule, week 1 shall be considered to be the first week after the contract award date.  Monthly reports, to be submitted electronically, will be due on the fifth business day of each month.

Week	                               Task
1	 Award contract and hold kickoff meeting to review project management plan 
2-3	 Meet with program staff to develop conceptual framework for searches

18	 Complete all analyses 
20-22	 Submit and revise draft report and outputs
24	 Submit final report and documentation

An electronic copy of each deliverable shall be submitted to the Project Officer.   

D.   Evaluation Criteria

Technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the task order; however, cost is also important to the overall award decision. All evaluation factors other than cost, when combined, are significantly more important than cost. The Government can make tradeoffs among cost and technical factors in determining which Quoter offers the best value by awarding to other than the lowest cost Quoter or other than the highest technically rated Quoter. Quoters are advised that award will be made to that Quoter whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government.

Technical Evaluation Criteria

In determining which quote represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the
Government?s needs, the Government shall evaluate quotes using the following technical evaluation criteria, which are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes:

<DESC>The United States Food and Drug Administration?s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)/Division of Product Quality in the Office of Vaccines Research and Review is seeking offers for a vacuum/gravity, microcomputer-controlled steam sterilizer.  The procurement should be delivered as a unit. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items (as defined by FAR 2.101) prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  A written request for quotations will not be issued.  This acquisition is subject to FAR Subpart 13.5 regarding the application of simplified acquisition procedures.  This acquisition is issued as Request for Quotation (RFQ) FDA-SOL-07-00338. All responsible business sources may submit an offer that will be considered.  The NAICS code is 334516. The small business size standard is 500 employees. This is NOT a small business set-aside.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18.  Offers in response to this RFQ shall be submitted by 3:00 p.m. EDT, August 13, 2007.  Quotes and questions shall be submitted via electronic mail to: Mrs. London Johnson. The email address is London.Johnson@fda.hhs.gov. This is an unrestricted solicitation. Offerors shall bid on ALL or NONE of the items identified in this solicitation.  The following information contains notations regarding special features of this unit.  A) TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: the chamber inside, which should be a measurement of 21" x 21" x 38" is required to accommodate trays of vials for reagent preparation.  This unit must have multiple pre-programmed cycles and vertical sliding door to accommodate space limitations in the Reagent Preparation area.  The unit must be equipped to perform cycles that include gravity, vacuum, liquid cycles and a Vacuum Leak Test cycle.  The unit must have operating displays that are easily understood and visible in the controlled environmental area.  Programmed cycle settings are protected with only authorized supervisors having access control.  The size is critical at this time, as a limited amount of space in new construction has been allocated for the unit; the unit must have a vertical sliding door that minimizes space requirements for the door swing in a controlled environmental area.  This unit shall be microprocessor-controlled, automatic steam sterilizer designed to sterilize heat and moisture-stabile laboratory, research and animal care supplies using gravity or downward displacement with positive pulsing conditioning for dynamic air removal, and sterilize liquids in self-venting or unsealed containers using controlled exhaust for linear and consistent cool down.  The temperature range is selectable from 110C to 135C (230F to 275F), for liquid cycles from 104C to 135C(219F to 275F.) which is necessary to sterilize many types of packaged goods such as vials, stoppers and instruments. Construction of this unit is of 316Ti stainless steel sectional U channels (jacket) welded around the 316Ti stainless steel inner chamber vessel.  The vessel can withstand working pressure of 45 psig and full vacuum.  Welded construction complies with ASME Code Section VIII division 1, U1 stamped vessel to allow installation into renovated area.  A stainless steel frame will rigidly support the pressure chamber and allow for some variance in height as the unit has adjustable feet; this will be a distinct advantage in the incorporation of the unit into the construction. The unit is equipped with a safety valve (ASME approved and so stamped) for pressure vessel which is set at the approved maximum operating pressure of the vessel.  The valve is sealed so that setting cannot be altered, and will blow down at least 2 psig before closing.  The valve is sized so that pressure in vessel will not rise more than 10 percent over the set pressure.  This unit as described is equipped with a Cross Contamination Barrier (CCB) designed to maintain air differential between the controlled environment where vials are prepared and the outside service areas.  A steel flange will be fully welded to load side of the sterilizer. The manufacturer of the unit supplies stainless steel sheet metal paneling to span distance from flange plate to wall opening and seals the flange plate/wall junction with silicone caulking compound, creating the required barrier separation.  The unit is also equipped with a safety and cross contamination door interlock to prevent the door from opening until successful completion of cycle. This unit is equipped with a vertical sliding Manual Door with the following properties to conserve space in the controlled environment where the vials are packaged.  Additionally, the door is constructed of 316Ti Stainless Steel plate and reinforced to withstand pressure and vacuum without deflection or leakage. A silicon rubber O ring gasket is self compensating and housed in a 316Ti stainless steel channel as part of chamber end ring. Gasket shall be easily replaced without the use of tools. The vertical sliding door is counterbalanced for ease of operation.  When open, it is totally out of the way, allowing safe and complete access to the chamber with the trays of vials.  Opening or closing the manual door requires only gentle upward or downward hand pressure. The installer insures that the exterior of the sterilizers and door(s) shall be covered with a minimum of 1.5" fiberglass insulation. Sterilizer is equipped with one standard chamber instrumentation port so in-house validation can be performed as needed.  This port is provided to facilitate insertion of test equipment and instrumentation leads. Microcomputer controls are PACS 3000 with cycles preprogrammed specifically designed for clean room facilities.  Controls are fabricated using state-of-the-art PLC technology.  The PACS 3000 controller incorporates F sub 0 functions as part of the software base and utilizes connected printed circuit boards (Control and Printer). The control side is provided with OP30 operating panels; the display is a 5.7 inch diagonal color screen.  Control panel(s) with touch pads and digital printer are located above  the chamber. Program control is subject to Cycle Backup so that, in case of a power failure, the back-up system holds cycle in phase for up to 1 minute until power is restored from Generators at the NLRC facility.  When power returns, event is recorded on printout and cycle resumes or restarts, depending on what phase cycle was in at time of power failure. The program microcomputer monitors and controls all phases of separate steam sterilizing cycles. Temperature display on the printer and and printout units may be recorded or observed either degrees F or degrees C; pressure display in psig/in Hg or Bars, and time either standard AM/PM or Military format.  In the laboratory mode of operation, sterilize temperature overdrive, over-temperature point, under-temperature point and chamber pressure points can be set by the operator. The printer must be capable of providing a duplicate print switch to furnish a duplicate printout of entire cycle data (when unit is not in cycle) or of current cycle status (during a cycle).  For validation purposes, the printout must have the with date, cycle count, daily cycle number, starting time of each cycle, sterilize temperature selected, sterilize and dry time selected, key transition points in the cycle, and any deviations which may jeopardize sterilization process. Piping used must be copper and brass threaded with standard National Pipe Thread and sealed with pipe sealant prior to tightening. Piping, fittings and connections required to connect the sterilizer to building supply lines are by others. B) INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS: The installer shall provide the following with the unit: 1) Wall trim panels 2) Boiler Control and Safety Device (CSD-1). Satisfies state ASME requirements for secondary low water cut-off as required by local jurisdiction.), 3) 304 Stainless Steel piping for clean steam Tissue Culture applications.  (Required house steam to jacket) 4) Thermocouple Gland, 5) Load RTD for temperature control of a liquid load, 6) Vacuum Pump (533LS w/ house steam only), and 7) Automatic Steam Boiler Blowdown C) UTILITY REQUIREMENTS: 1) Plant Steam Supply: 3/4 inch (19) NPT, 40-50 psig, 96 lbs/hr, 2) Cold Water: 3/4 inch (19) NPT, 30-60 psig, 6 gpm, 3) Compressed Air: 1/4inch(7) NPT, 70-100 psig dynamic, 1 SCFM, 4) Drain:1/2 inch (38) ODT, 5) Electric:1/2 inch (13), 115V, 50/60 Hz, and 6) Hot Water:1/2 inch (13) NPT, 20-50 psig (min.), 0.4 gpm.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A)

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number N00421-07-R-0097 is issued as a request for Quote (RFQ).  The incorporated document and provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-17, Defense Acquisition Circular 91-13, and DFARS Change Notice 20070531.  

This requirement is being synopsized as a competitive acquisition under the North American Industry Classification System code 333314.  

The EO & Special Mission Sensors Division of NAVAIR (AIR-4.5.6)  intends to purchase fabrication services to manufacture a fresnel wedge-prism disk (16.75 inch diameter and 0.9 inch thick) out of Acrylic (PMMA) provided by AIR-456.   The resultant fresnel wedge-prism disk will be a one-piece disk (not several pieces glued or bolted together).  It will be spun at 960 RPM in its intended application.  The fresnel wedge-prism disk will be used to refract blue-green light from a nominal angle of 19.5? to 0? (see Figure 1 below).  Figure 2 shows a detailed view of the Fresnel side of the disk.

Respondents should demonstrate they possess the expertise needed to complete this job by citing previous work examples and by describing the machining equipment and methods they propose to use.  This work requires expertise in the following areas.

- Optical-grade diamond-turned machining of acrylic for high transmission and minimal optical distortion.
- Optical-grade diamond-turned machining of large single piece acrylic material (16.75" diameter and 0.9" thick).
- Specifying and acquiring a custom shaped diamond cutting bit may be required.

Figure 1 Simple Picture of Fresnel Wedge-Prism Disk (Note: Simple will be e-mailed at request of Contractor)

Figure 2 Detail (Note:  SOW detail (Figure's 1-3) Table 1 & 2 will be e-mailed at request of Contractor)

The fresnel wedge-prism disk shall be built according to the specifications in both Table 1 and Table 2.  Figure 3 shows an image of an engineering drawing of the full scale piece.

NAVAIR AIR-456 will provide the acrylic blanks.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number N860010-7-05927rs is issued as a request for quotation. No set-aside is identified for this RFP. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541990. The National Institute of Standards and Technology has a requirement for technical support services described below.  The Performance Based Statement of Work is as follows:

The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) studies building materials; computer-integrated construction practices; fire science and fire safety engineering; and structural, mechanical, and environmental engineering. Products of the laboratory's research include measurements and test methods, performance criteria, and technical data that support innovations by industry and are incorporated into building and fire standards and codes. One of BFRL?s major program areas is Healthy and Sustainable Buildings, to which the Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability (BEES) software project is a major contributor.  BEES uses the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach to evaluate the environmental performance of products based on life-cycle inventory (LCI) data compiled by LCA practitioners for more than 500 environmental flows including raw materials and energy use, air emissions, water effluent, and solid waste.

NIST takes a lead role, with its BEES software, database, and methods, in providing guidance to the building community on the life cycle environmental and economic performance of products.  Reliable, consistent LCI data are key to BEES? success.

With this contract, NIST seeks to take a first step beyond evaluation of building products and simple building product systems toward evaluation of entire facilities. The scope of this contract is limited to commercial and residential buildings. 

The primary objective of this contract is for a Contractor to develop a mapping framework to directly connect an existing, or readily-adaptable, Input/Output (I/O)-based LCI framework with the fixed, BEES-based LCI framework.

The expected outcome is the ability to estimate, in a consistent, transparent manner, the environmental performance of commercial and residential buildings.

Period of Performance - The period of performance is from date of award through 29 FEB 2008.

SPECIFIC TASKS
The Contractor shall develop a mapping framework for converting I/O-based LCI results into the BEES impact assessment framework. Specific tasks include:

1.	Select a robust, transparent U.S. IO-LCA database.  Publicly or commercially available documentation shall exist for the selected database that provides detailed, transparent information on its compilation.

2.	Map the LCI flows produced as output of the selected IO-LCA database to the BEES LCI flows. Attached is an Excel file (PWS Attachment #1) giving the fixed BEES LCI flow list, the environmental media to which they refer, and the units in which they are expressed. 

3.	Document matched flows. For IO-LCA database flows with direct, or convertible, mappings to BEES flows, document the match. See the ?Matched Flows? tab of  PWS Attachment #2; the cells highlighted in yellow are those that are to be completed for all matched flows. As shown in the attachment, for each matched flow, list the corresponding flow from the selected IO-LCA database. Provide the units in which the IO-LCA database reports these corresponding flows, as well as their CAS Registry numbers if they exist.

4.	Document unmatched flows. For IO-LCA database flows without direct or convertible mappings to BEES flows, document the matching failure. See the ?Unmatched Flows? tab of PWS Attachment #2; the cells highlighted in yellow are those that are to be completed for all unmatched flows. As shown in the attachment, documentation includes type of mismatch between BEES flows and IO-LCA flows and suggested work-around, work-around, other suggestion as to how to handle the unmatch, or justification for ignoring the BEES flow (e.g., insignificant--x %- contribution to all 12 BEES environmental impacts)

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-18.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333314 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

The NIST Center for Neurtron Research (NCNR) designs, builds, operates and maintains a suite of cold and thermal neutron scattering instrumentation used in the conduct of material structure research.  The instruments which employ cold neutrons for research have the neutrons directed to them via mirrored guides.  The alignment of these guides to one another is critical to achieve the optimum transmission of neutrons.  The alignment of the instruments with respect to the guides is equally important for the collection of scientific data.

The NCNR is under a new expansion directive that will include the construction of a new Guide Hall.  This Guide Hall will house at least four (4) instrument guides.  The Industrial Theodolites will be used to facilitate the alignment of these guides during installation.  The accuracy of the Industrial Theodolites will be key to providing the best possible transmission of neutrons through the guides.  Once the guide network has been established, a variety of scientific instruments will be installed and aligned with respect to individual guides.  The alignment precision of the instruments with respect to the guides is directly correlated with their peak performance.

The following clauses are incorporated for purposes of this notice and will be included in the contract award document by either reference or full text:  FAR 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS; FAR 52.212-3, OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS w ALT I; FAR 52.212-4, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS; FAR 52.212-5 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS- COMMERCIAL ITEMS to include FAR 52.219-6 (ALT I), 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-33 (if DFAS payment), 52.232-34, 52.232-36 (if credit card payment), 52.247-64; DFARS 252.212-7001, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS to include DFARS 252.225-7036, 252.232-7003, 252.247-7023 w ALT III, 252.247-7024; AND DFARS 252.212-7000 OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS.  These clauses may be viewed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.  Additional required clauses other than those above may be included as Addenda on the award document.  
The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this RFQ to a responsible offeror using the lowest price technically acceptable process.  Quotes shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement and Factor 2 ? Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a ?go/no go? basis.  If a quote has been determined to be a ?go? on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror?s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quote and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its quote evaluated for the lowest price.
Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of descriptive literature that clearly indicates what the offeror is proposing and will be providing all products in accordance with the stated characteristics in the Scope of Work (SOW).  ?Descriptive literature? means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quote.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered meet the specifications in the SOW.  The information is required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  
                                              
Factor 2 ? Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror?s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror?s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quote will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

Offerors must submit a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3 OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS with the price offer, or may complete the representations and certifications on the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Failure to include the certifications along with a price proposal will render an offeror ineligible for award.   All questions and inquiries should be addressed via email to the Contract Specialist POC, daniel.herring@dla.mil, Request for Quote Number SP3100-7127-3136.  Prices, representations/certifications, descriptive literature, and past performance information must be received NLT 4:00 PM EDT on August 16, 2007.  This information should be submitted to the above email address or faxed to 717-770-7591.  Contractors must be capable of accepting payment by either electronic funds transfer or government credit card for this procurement.  ALL SOURCES MUST BE REGISTERED IN THE CENTRAL CONTRACT REGISTRATION DATABASE, http://www.ccr.gov/, or an award cannot be processed.

On-Board Safety System Deployment and Industry Demographics Analysis

	
GENERAL

Background 
 
Safety is at the heart of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's (FMCSA) mission. Working together with the trucking industry, FMCSA envisions a future of smart technologies that support the expanding role of the trucking industry to safely, securely, and efficiently transport the nation's goods and products. One way to save lives and reduce the number of injuries on the nation??s highways is through the expanded use of on-board safety systems, such as lane departure warning systems, stability control systems, and collision warning systems.

Although these systems are being deployed by some carriers, information from carriers of different sizes will be valuable in advancing further use of these systems in the trucking industry.  For instance, preliminary research indicates that the largest segment of the industry, small fleets and owner-operators, face severe economic pressures and safety challenges. Consequently, on-board safety technologies might provide smaller carriers with the safety returns on investments (ROI) that large carriers reap from more extensive safety initiatives. Yet, few carriers in this group appear willing or able to invest in safety technologies.  As a result, research is needed to understand different trucking industry segments and their deployment of on-board safety systems.

Purpose

The purpose of this contract is to conduct a trucking industry demographics analysis relating to the use of on-board safety systems and various carriers?? operating characteristics and financial and safety requirements. 

Definition of a Performance Requirement
  
Performance requirements are described as performance objectives, measures, and standards in the following manner:

Performance Objective - A statement of the outcome or results.
Performance Measure - The critical characteristics of the objective that will be monitored by the Government.
Performance Standard - The targeted level or range of levels of performance measure, relating to the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) for the objective.

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS 

For this effort, the contractor shall conduct research on carrier issues, operating characteristics, and financial and safety requirements related to the deployment of on-board safety systems, as well as develop different, concurrent, and equally effective strategies for increasing deployment by addressing these unique stakeholder needs and issues.

Trucking Industry Demographic Data and On-board Safety System Evaluation 

The trucking industry is relatively homogenous in its organizational design related to functional roles of personnel; however, firm size typically dictates the number of different functional roles for any one person. For example, larger firms have dedicated staff in charge of individual functions such as maintenance, safety, investment, and staffing, whereas smaller firms may have a single individual who is responsible for a combination of these functions.  This project will focus on an analysis of different carriers?? internal safety and financial roles and requirements related to the adoption of on-board safety systems:  lane departure warning systems, stability control systems, and collision warning systems.

Performance Objective 1 ?V The contractor shall identify economic (i.e. financial requirements, limitations, and investment thresholds), safety, and operational characteristics, as well as individual personnel functions for the following carrier sectors: small carriers (1-20 trucks), medium carriers (21-100 trucks), and large carriers (over 100 trucks).  Then, the contractor shall document the impact of these different industry characteristics and personnel functions for each sector of carriers that influence on-board safety technology adoption decisions across and within carrier sectors.  The contractor shall include an analysis of characteristics that distinguish technology adoption by carriers and their drivers who are new to the industry, or have specific traits or histories that place them in a ??high-risk?? category for future crashes. The contractor shall specifically identify the economic pressures and safety challenges of small trucking fleets and owner-operators. 

Performance Objective 2 ?V Using information obtained in performance objective 1, the contractor shall develop different, concurrent, and equally effective strategies for increasing the deployment of on-board safety systems by addressing unique stakeholder needs and issues among the different segments of the trucking industry. The contractor shall specifically address the issues related to the continued use of these systems as they trickle down to the carriers who purchase used trucks with these systems.

Performance Objective 3 ?V For performance objectives 1 and 2, the contractor shall collect data from both industry databases and carrier interviews/surveys.  The carrier demographics shall include existing on-board safety system users and non-users. To collect this information, the contractor shall interview key organizations and personnel across a representative sample of fleet sectors and sizes. All appropriate FMCSA and other Government approval processes and procedures must be in place prior to data collection.  Prior to proceeding with data collection, the contractor shall prepare and review a data collection plan that includes all information collection techniques and instruments with FMCSA to receive FMCSA approval to proceed.   

Performance Objective 4 ?V The contractor shall provide a copy of all data collection results and analyses to FMCSA for performance objectives 1-3 in a preliminary draft report. The contractor shall prepare a draft written report with the findings of performance objectives 1-3 that will include data collection results and analyses.

Case Studies

Documenting detailed case studies from current users about their own decisions to adopt on-board safety systems and their experiences using them can provide insight into the effectiveness of the on-board safety systems.  

Performance Objective 5 ?V The contractor shall conduct a minimum of six case studies focusing on different carriers?? decision-making processes to adopt on-board safety systems and their experiences using them, as follows: 

?X	Two small carriers/fleets (1-20 trucks) -  one fleet using stability control systems and one fleet using collision warning systems and/or lane departure warning systems.  

?X	Two medium carriers/fleets (21-100 trucks) -  one fleet using stability control systems and one fleet using collision warning systems and/or lane departure warning systems.  

?X	Two large carriers/fleets (over 100 trucks) -  one fleet using stability control systems and one fleet using collision warning systems and/or lane departure warning systems.  

The contractor shall ensure that the set of case studies includes all of the following technologies from as many different vendors as feasible:  lane departure warning systems, roll stability control systems, electronic stability control systems, and collision warning systems. 

Prior to proceeding with the data collection, the contractor shall provide preliminary information about potential carriers (i.e., fleet size, typical operations, typical length of haul, commodities hauled, and fleet vehicle characteristics) agreeing to provide information for the case studies and all data collection questions and techniques for FMCSA review and approval. The case study protocol shall be conducted in the following systematic way: 
?X	Develop the research questions related to the use of on-board safety systems and the resulting safety benefits 
?X	Select the cases and determine data gathering and analysis techniques to ensure that each case study is well constructed to ensure validity and reliability 
?X	Collect data 
?X	Evaluate and analyze the data

In each case study, the contractor shall document the carrier??s decision making in the purchase and acquisition of on-board safety systems, their expected and actual return on investment timelines, and their changes in crash rates before and after the deployment of these systems in each of the fleets participating in each case study. The contractor shall document issues from each carrier regarding safety impacts, reliability, and validity of the safety technologies, which may include information about false positives and problems with different warning technologies.

In each case study, the contractor shall cite additional information about each specific carrier??s experience using these systems that highlights the key steps and elements of safety technology installation, testing, maintenance, training, and usage. The contractor shall focus on the training costs, requirements, and supports in place for drivers using the technologies; maintenance staff  performing upkeep maintenance; and managers analyzing the data for each carrier.  The contractor shall provide information about the collection and use of data from these on-board safety systems by each carrier, including how the data is handled and potential future uses of the data. The contractor shall include information on technology acceptance at all levels, from drivers through upper management, necessary for successful implementation and use of safety technologies for each carrier.  The contractor shall also document any additional challenges, issues, and processes relating to the use of the systems by each individual carrier in each case study. 

The contractor shall analyze, validate, and compare the information collected from the case studies with the larger population of carriers in each segment. In addition to providing information about the relationship between on-board safety systems and highway safety, the contractor shall include information in these case studies that can provide the basis for relaying positive aspects about safety-conscious carriers.

Performance Objective 6 ?V The contractor shall add the six case studies to the report prepared in performance objective 4 in a second version of the draft report.
  
Safety Technology Expert Panel

Utilizing a safety technology expert panel would allow FMCSA to gather expert opinions about safety technology deployment and adoption issues in a diverse industry with varying issues and requirements.

Performance Objective 7 ?V The contractor shall create a credible expert panel of safety technology users and stakeholders for information collection and sharing about safety technology deployment and related initiatives.  The major duties of this panel will be to provide real world input into key safety technology issues relating to the objectives in this statement of work. The panel could meet via telecons, webcasts, and at annual industry meetings.  Key experts shall include, but not be limited to:  FMCSA, industry associations (i.e., ATA, state trucking associations, National Private Truck Council [NPTC], Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association [OOIDA]), motor carriers (small, medium, and large), insurance companies, and industry suppliers (original equipment manufacturers [OEMs], and safety technology manufacturers).  It is anticipated that the expert panel would meet a minimum of twice a year.  Prior to proceeding with the finalization of the panel members, the contractor shall receive FMCSA approval to proceed.

Performance Objective 8 ?V The contractor shall prepare a list of invited experts, invitation notices, meeting agendas, and discussion topics for approval by FMCSA prior to the notification of each expert panel meeting.

Performance Objective 9 ?V The contractor shall coordinate the meetings; contact and invite stakeholder  representatives to the meetings; develop the meetings?? formats; provide background material; serve as a liaison for requests for information; lead and facilitate discussions; coordinate the presentation of material at the meeting; and record comments of the presented material.  

Cumulative Project Report

Performance Objective 10 ?V The contractor shall build upon the draft report created for performance objectives 4 and 6 and synthesize the findings in performance objectives 1-9 in a Cumulative Project Report. The purpose of the Cumulative Report is to merge, consolidate, and analyze the documentation and results of the surveys, interviews, case studies and expert panels related to industry use and perspectives of on-board safety technologies in the different segments of the industry.  By consolidating the data for examination and analysis, the relationships and factors involved in the selection, use, and effect of on-board safety technologies shall be identified in the different industry segments.  

Performance Objective 11 ?V The contractor shall prepare and make a presentation of the synthesis report to FMCSA.  A copy of the Powerpoint presentation shall be provided to FMCSA at least two weeks prior to the final presentation in Washington, DC.  Comments from the attendees at this meeting shall be incorporated in the Final Cumulative Project Report on performance objective 10.

DEDUCTIONS

The contractor shall be assessed a deduction in an amount equaling to a one-time 2% amount of the total price based on the price billed for each deliverable when products are ??returned for correction?? and/or not delivered on schedule to the Contracting Officer responsible for the work.
 
Application of Deduction:
 
The agency will review all requirements that are required to be completed in accordance with Contract Performance Monitoring Section. If the contractor meets the requirement for a deduction (the company has not met the deliverable requirements/milestones), an amount equaling the deduction, upon approval by the Contracting Officer, will be subtracted from the next invoice.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is as follows: 

1)  Provide answers to industry questions. 

2)  Issue deadline for all questions ? Aug. 1, 2007.

3)  Restate proposal due date of August 7, 2007 @ 2 pm local time.

1)  Will the Tracen's have projection equipment including overhead projectors and other classroom supplies, i.e. flip charts, available? No. 

2)  Will there be business services, i.e. internet access, wireless, printing, copying, faxing available to contractors and students? No.

3)  Will beverages, e.g. coffee, tea, soda, water, be provided to contractors and students at the facility? No.

4)  Will there be any facility charges to the contractors? No. 

5)  Is there a requirement for the contractors to have clearances or other security documentation? No.  

6)  Will the contractor's receive personal and vehicle security passes for the two locations? No, they will obtain a security badge at each location for the week. 

7)  Will the Tracen's handle the receiving of training materials? Yes, but they need to be notified before hand that they are being shipped. 

8)  Is there onsite storage for training materials? Yes, there is limited space. 

9)  Will shipping be provided for students to send their large volume of training materials to their units or homes?  Yes.

10)  We note that the dates indicated are Monday thru Thursday.  However, the RFP calls for a 4 or 5 day course and we intend on providing a 4.5 day course, requiring instructional facilities for Monday thru Friday.  Will the facilities be available and scheduled for that following Friday as well? Yes.

11)  Since change of location, will you have Hazwoper equipment (Suits, scba's, decon items, etc.) for training?  If so, what equipment?  We will not need any of the equipment for training. The training should be classroom based and the equipment can be discussed. The training should be based on OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q)(6)(ii) first responder operations level.

12)  Will lodging, mess, and transportation (from lodging to classroom) be available at the Training Centers for the contract instructors?  No, however there is a mess available.

13) You have off the shelf products?  The off the shelf product is referring to the (train the trainer) course used to train adult educators and centered around first responders. We want something that is already being utilized and not developed by the contractor just for our course. The contractor is to provide the course material.

14) Do you require SCBA (self contained breathing apparatus) training?  No, we do not want SCBA training.

15) Do you require training in Level A hazmat suit?  No, we do not want Level A hazmat suit training.

16) Hotel and transportation to be provided is not specific enough. DO you want contractor hotels in the area of the training, do I have to provide transportation to and from the class? Please give more details.  Please see Amendment 00001 to solicitation.  The contractor is no longer responsible for providing the facility.  We will be utilizing a Government training facility.  The contractor is responsible for providing his/her own transportation to the Government facility.

17) Are Power point CD's for all students & ERG's acceptable.  Power point CD's for the course is fine as long as the ERG's are hard copy because the students will not have access to computers during the class. 

18) The only off the shelf stuff I have is from Homeland Security for WMD and they are DVD's.  Are these acceptable? Yes.
