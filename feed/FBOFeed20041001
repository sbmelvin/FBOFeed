<SOLNBR>N0016405R0001
<CONTACT>JOHN DEMENT 812-854-4164
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. POINT OF CONTACT: Mr. John Dement, NSWC Crane Science & Technology Officer, e-mail M_Crane_STO@navy.mil, 812-854-4164 The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) conducts Research and Development (R&D) directed toward ordnance, electronics, and electronic warfare technologies, processes, systems, subsystems and components in support of our nation’s warfighters.  For Ordnance, the Division's primary technical areas include Small Arms, Pyrotechnics, Ground Ordnance, and Surface Ordnance.  The Electronics area includes Electrochemical Power Systems, Displays & Peripherals, Acoustic Sensors, Microelectronics, Computers & Processors, Chemical-Biological, and Physical Security.  Areas of interest in Electronic Warfare are Electronic Countermeasures & Surveillance Systems, Night Vision/Electro-Optics, Microwave Components, and Radar.  Our mission is to provide Acquisition, Fleet Support, Acquisition Engineering, R&D, Product Engineering, Systems Engineering, Test & Evaluation, Logistics, Maintenance & Repair, Legacy Systems/Products, and Program Management.  Within these mission ! areas the Division is responsible for the full spectrum of R&D, acquisition, and fleet support.  Typical functions include fundamental research; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; and development of operational systems.  NSWC Crane is interested in receiving proposals for R&D in all of its mission areas.  This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2).  It is intended that this BAA be open for a period of three years from the date of publication. Proposals may be submitted by any non-governmental entity including commercial firms, non-profit organizations, and institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia comprising such concerns.  NSWC Crane encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone smal! l business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions (HBCUs/MIs).  However, no part of this BAA is specifically reserved for HBCUs/MIs.  The following guidelines apply to concept papers or proposals.  Typically each proposal may be: (1) funded incrementally for periods up to three years subject to the availability of appropriations; (2) funded between $10,000 to $5,000,000, with the size of each dependent upon the topic (although NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds); (3) more than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area; (4) NSWC Crane is not interested in concepts that already have been developed or proven (even if they never have been sold before); (5) NSWC Crane seeks proposals for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding; and ! (6) deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation rather than focus on a specific system or hardware solution.  Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and would not be considered for funding.  In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as a preliminary step, interested parties are strongly encouraged to submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper").  This white paper should not exceed 10 pages, with an executive summary (short paragraph) on the effort, a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, current Technology Readiness Level (TRL) (see attached APPENDIX 6, TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVELS AND THEIR DEFINITIONS found at www.crane.navy.mil/supply/homepage.htm and anticipated TRL if project is funded, and a rough cost estimate.  Offerors should submit the white papers electronically.  A title, BAA number, of! feror name, project duration, approximate cost, and a brief abstract with information explicitly pertinent to the proposed work must accompany the white paper.  The Government reserves the right to request a proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers.  Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not assure a subsequent award.  Offerors may submit full technical and cost proposals even if they did not submit a white paper or their white paper was not identified as promising.  The Government will acknowledge the receipt of white papers and full technical and cost proposals by e-mail.  White papers (and any resulting proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific, technical, and socio-economic merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential nava! l relevance and contributions of the effort to NSWC Crane's specific mission areas; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to NSWC Crane programs are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered to NSWC Crane with unrestricted (at least Government Purpose) rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; and (6) Realism/reasonableness of the proposed costs and the availability of funds.  These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price.  ! Based on evaluation of the white papers, participants may be selected and invited to submit full technical and cost proposals for evaluation by NSWC Crane using the above noted evaluation criteria.  An invitation to submit a full proposal does not guarantee funding. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED.  For efforts funded as legally binding commitments, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions.  This is to notify potential proposers that each grant or cooperative agreement that may be placed under this announcement or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause: "As a condit! ion for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents, the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students. If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements, and it may suspend or terminate such grants and agreements unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award."  If your institution has be! en identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any grant, including any existing grant; (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a grant or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation.  Any commercial firm or institution of higher education may submit a proposal.  There is no longer a requirement that the entity be U.S. in origin.  White papers may be submitted any time prior to expiration of the BAA.  There is no set date for submission.  The World Wide Web page for NSWC Crane may be accessed for additional information regarding the mission, programs and objectives of the Division at http:\\www.crane.navy.mil. The following e-mail point of contact is provided for information regarding technical programs/technologies of interest within ! the warfare areas supported by NSWC Crane and for submission of white papers and proposals: Mr. John Dement (e-mail M_Crane_STO@navy.mil).  Please refer to BAA number N00164-05-R-0001 in all correspondence and communications.

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice to announce the upcoming solicitation by the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) for the recompetition of the NDBC Technical Services Contract at Stennis Space Center, MS.  NDBC is located on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, at John C. Stennis Space Center in Bay St. Louis.  NDBC is comprised of a combination of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) civil service employees, U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) personnel, and a service contractor.  Working as an integrated team, NDBC manages the development, operations, and maintenance of the Marine Observation Network (MON), in direct support of the NOAA Marine Observation Program.  This team serves as the NOAA focal point for data buoy and associated meteorological and environmental monitoring.  

The MON is an integrated, sustained ocean observation and information delivery system that serves U.S. coastal waters, as well as the offshore waters of Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Great Lakes.  The system consists of headland and moored buoy data acquisition platforms, real-time processing and information quality control, and product delivery systems.  The delivery system components include: Moored Buoys, Coastal Marine Automated Network (CMAN) sites, Volunteer Observing Ships (VOS) program, and Oceanographic Drifting Buoys and Subsurface Oceanographic Floats.  NDBC requires technical services to provide uninterrupted delivery of high quality, real-time environmental data to the operational elements of NOAA for weather and ocean forecasts and warnings and for climate variability indications and assessments.  The technical services contractor is expected to provide Engineering, Operational, Logistics, and Information Technology support to operate and maintain the MON.

This solicitation will be for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a $500,000,000 ceiling that includes a five-year base contract and five award-term years.  The minimum guarantee for this IDIQ is $250,000 over the life of the contract.  Although NDBC’s existing requirement is approximately $10,000,000 per year, the Nation is concentrating on improving its understanding of the global ocean.  There has been much discussion on increasing and improving NOAA’s ocean observation capability.  Based on the national dialogue, NDBC predicts a three to five fold increase in its capability requirements in the next ten years.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 561210 – Facility Support Services.  The Small Business Size Standard is $30,000,000.  This solicitation will be unrestricted and all offerors classified as large businesses shall submit a subcontracting plan for utilization of small business.  Our subcontracting goals can be found at http://www.osec.doc.gov/osdbu/Accomplishments.htm.   

The solicitation will be a Request for Proposal (RFP) and will be awarded using Best Value Competitive Procedures detailed in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15.  Evaluation criteria will be advertised with the release of the RFP.  NDBC plans to release the RFP on or about October 15, 2004.  In order to receive a copy of this solicitation, you must register with this website.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<ARCHDATE>01292005
<CONTACT>Jean Kampschroeder, 703-325-6173
<DESC>The LKMD will be a simple, compact, modular, sensor-based warning system with programmable responses that can be used either as a tactical stand-alone system or as a supplemental device used with other security systems or missions.  The LKMD is envis ioned as a modular system to include (1) one motion sensor module (MSM); (2) two light modules (LM); (3) one remote control/monitor (RCM); (4) one power supply/recharger; (5) spare batteries/battery pack(s); (6) accessories; and (7) carrying case(s).  The LKMD system will be capable of detecting intruders using remotely located  MSM.  The MSM subsequently controls preprogrammed responses ranging from visible illumination (continuous or strobe), infrared (IR) illumination, audible alarm, or a combination of any or all of the above.  In all cases of intruder detection, alarm indication is presented on the RCM.  The primary function of the MSM is to detect the motion of an intruder (individual and/or vehicular).  The secondary function of the MSM is the command  and control of preprogrammed responses to intruder detection.  This function includes the control of the LM, generation and forwarding of alarm signals to the RCM, generation of local audio alarms, and communications with the RCM.  The MSM is primarily ba ttery-powered with the capability of accepting external power.  The LM provides the illumination response as directed by the MSM.  This response includes visible illumination (continuous or strobe), IR illumination, or a combination of the illumination typ es.  The RCM is the control/monitor point for the LKMD system.  The functions of the RCM are to monitor system activity, display/annunciate alarm indications and control system responses to intruder detection.  The RCM is envisioned to be a small hand-held  unit.  The LKMD program will be managed by the Product Manager, Force Protection Systems (FPS), Fort Belvoir, Virginia.  The U.S. Army Military Police School (USAMPS) is the combat developer.  Offerors will be provided with a Statement of Objectives and p erformance specification from which to prepare a competitive proposal and performance work statement (PWS) for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD), Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP), and Full Rate Production (FRP) phases of this acquisition. In  order to minimize development and production risks and avoid costly delays, the Government anticipates a six-year SDD/LRIP/FRP effort broken out as follows: (1) Design, fabricate, integrate, test (PQT 1a/b and PQT 2), deliver and support (during an Early User Appraisal  EUA  and Logistics Demonstration LD) 40 ETF prototypes to include drafting operator/maintainer manuals, commercial and engineering drawings and associated lists, and operator/maintainer training within 24 months of contract award; (2) Produce, test (PVT 1a/b and PVT 2), deliver and support (during Operational TestingOT) 150 ETF LRIP systems, to include operator/maintainer manuals, development and update of production item detail specifications, and conduct of operator/maintainer tr aining, at the Governments option, during a follow-on 12 month period; (3) Produce, test (PAT 1a/b and PAT 2), deliver and support an estimated 28,847 FRP systems, to include operator/maintainer manuals, commercial and engineering drawings and associated lists, and operator/maintainer training, at the Governments option, during three follow-on one-year periods;  (4) Warrant LRIP and FRP LKMD components for a period of two years following acceptance; and (5) Provide renewable one-year Life Cycle Contractor  Support (LCCS) at the Governments option.  The government anticipates a basic contract consisting of a two year Cost Plus Award Fee SDD phase, with options for a one-year Fixed Price Incentive-Successive Target (FPIS) LRIP and three one-year FPIS FRP per iods.  The contractor will be selected on the basis of a full and open competition for the written proposal that offers the best value to the Government.  The evalua tion will use a tradeoff process. Evaluation factors will include Technical, Cost, Performance Risk, and Small Business Participation Plan.  Technical subfactors include (1) System Development; (2) System Demonstration; (3) Production; (4) Supportability; and (5) PWS.  Oral presentations before a source selection evaluation board after identification of those offers within a competitive range may occur. A contract may be awarded to an offeror proposing other than the lowest price.  The Government anticipate s award by 1 March 2005.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) No. W909MY-05-R-0001.

<DESC>Amendment Three (3) to Solicitation 263-2004-(FW)-0088  is issued to change the NAICS Code to 561730, all information remains the same.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of sources for turf maintenance and ice and snow removal services for general and selected areas. This requirement is to provide a comprehensive Turf Maintenance and, Ice and Snow Removal Program. The areas with service requirements include the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Bethesda, Maryland campus and the National Institutes of Health Animal Center (NIHAC) Poolesville, Maryland campus.

The successful contractor shall furnish any and all the requested services by providing the necessary qualified personnel, material, equipment, tools and supplies as needed and in a timely manner to perform the requested services. 

The area for turf services at the Bethesda campus is approximately 59.45 hectares with an estimated number of 36 mowing/trimmings required per season.  Up to four complete edging of pavement areas may be required.  Up to 16 hectares may be selected for turf verifying, over-seeding and fertilization and up to 100 hectares may be selected for leaf removal. The NIHAC, Poolesville campus encompasses approximately 112.9 hectares of which approximately 40.9 hectares comprise fine lawns and approximately 72.0 hectares of fenced pasture fields. The remaining acreage is heavily wooded.  Approximately 34 fine lawn mowing and up to 4 pasture mowings will be required per season. 

The ice and snow removal services will generally consist of a comprehensive control and removal program for accumulations on the Bethesda and Poolesville campuses between November 01 and April 15 of the contract year.

The value for these services is a strong function of prevailing weather conditions.


If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide the following information: 1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address and telephone number as well as size and type of ownership for the organization. THIS REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN SET ASIDE FOR THE SBA 8(a) PROGRAM.  ALL INTERESTED 8(a) COMPANIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO SUBMIT A REQUEST. The NAICS code for this requirement is 561730 with a standard size of $6 million. Organizations responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused and pertinent information is requested. 
Although no geographic restriction is anticipated, if responding organizations are located outside the Washington Metropolitan area, indicate how the organization would coordinate with the agency program office to provide support to multiple sites. The Government will evaluate the capability information using the following criteria: 1) potential technical capability to provide the administrative support services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice; 2) capacity to secure and apply the full range of human and technical resources required to successfully perform these requirements; 3) potential capability to implement a successful project management plan that includes: compliance with program schedules; meeting and tracking performance; hiring and retention of key personnel; and 4) potential to provide services under a performance based service acquisition contract .
Interested firms responding to this survey are encouraged to structure capability statements in the order of the area of consideration noted above.

<DESC>UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/ bidders will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.   Contractors who already are registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) can get a head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca  to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond  what ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.  It is a market research tool to determine the  availability and capability of potential sources.  Firms responding  to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large or  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned  small business, HUBZone small business and/or service disabled  veteran-owned small business.

<DESC>1.  Introduction:    Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) provides the foundation for network-centric operations by creating a set of nine core services for joint and service systems to use. NCES is part of the larger Global Information Grid (GIG) Enterprise Services (ES).  The GIG ES supports the entire Department of Defense’s Information Technology (IT) requirements, including the Business and Warfighting domains, as well as interfaces with the national Intelligence Community (IC) domain.  
 
As the enterprise services component of the Global Information Grid, NCES is the infrastructure on which Department of Defense (DoD) computer applications (e.g., C2, Combat Support, and Medical) rely.  This new environment must (1) support posting data to common storage spaces as early as possible; (2) alert edge users to changes in relevant DoD information or time-critical events affecting their survival or threatening their mission; (3) provide users, down to the last tactical mile, with the capability to pull whatever they want, whenever they want, from wherever they are and limited only by the commander’s information management policy; (4) ensure information assurance (IA)/security; and (5) support interoperability among allies, coalition, and multinational partners.  NCES relies upon the GIG transport services and tactical communications systems for the exchange between the Core Enterprise Services (CESs) and the systems providing Community of Interest (CoI) capabilities.  Transport is not an inherent component of NCES; however, the CESs are dependent upon adequate bandwidth and availability of the GIG infrastructure to support the domains and CoIs.  

The specifications listed below are used to support this architecture:
		
SOAP
WSDL
UDDI
WS-Interoperability
XACML
SAML
XML-DSIG
XKMS
WS-Security
X.509 Token Profile
SAML Token Profile

2. Security Core Enterprise Services (CESs)
The Security CESs, consist of a number of functional service groups, each of which may include one or more service interfaces that perform specific tasks.  

2.1 Policy Services

This service group provides policy-based authorization for Web Services and system resources. 

2.1.1	Policy Decision Service 
2.1.2	Policy Retrieval Service 
2.1.3	Policy Administration Service
2.1.4	Policy Subscription Service 

2.2 Credential Management Services

This group of services provides access to the underlying DoD PKI infrastructure.  The group is envisioned to offer a subset of XKMS functionality, starting with the X-KISS spec and potentially moving into X-KRSS as well. In the future, this service group may also support credential technologies other than PKI.

2.2.1	Certificate Validation Service 
2.2.2	Certificate Registration Service
2.2.3	Certificate Retrieval Service

2.3 Attribute Services

In order to support policy-based decisions, various attributes are needed. This includes those of the principals, the system resources, and the application environment.  This service group provides standard access to such attributes. The request-response mechanism is the standard SAML Protocol. Responses to attribute queries are in the form of SAML attribute assertions.  

2.3.1	Principal Attribute Service  

2.4 Trust Domain Federation Services

This group of services is responsible for supporting the management of a trust domain’s trust relationships with other domains.  Its interfaces may include registering and deregistering other domains as trusted parties, and inquiring about established trust relationships. 

2.5 Security Context Services

This group of services provides mechanisms for establishing, expressing and controlling security contexts across multiple Web Services.  Such contexts are necessary in a dynamic SOA environment where indirect or brokered trust relationships abound.  For example, when service A invokes service B on an end-user’s behalf, a common security context can help establish a boundary for this unit of work so that, for instance, service A cannot forward the request to an unintended service C even if A possesses a valid user assertion.

In an enterprise service environment, security contexts are important in the management of service orchestrations and workflows.  They may also help improve efficiency, especially in interactive scenarios. For example, results of certain authentication and authorization steps may be performed only once for a series of consumer-provider interactions within a common security context. 

Currently there are standards proposals under development such as WS-Trust, WS-SecureConversation, and WS-Coordination that address this topic.  Future service specifications will consider conformance to them once they become approved.

2.6 Logging and Auditing Services

Enterprise auditing is also an important requirement for the security architecture. Two pieces of functionality need to be provided:  recording the service level activities (logging), and identifying anomalies (such as abuse of privilege, access violations or attacks) from those records.  The logs include:

-Outbound message information (message ID, sending timestamp, host, target service, etc.)
-Inbound message information (message ID, receiving timestamp, etc.)
-Message signature verification (success / failure)
-Certificate validation and status checking results (success / failure)
-Policy decision results (permit / deny / indeterminate)
-Invocation status (resource, action, success / failure)
-Remote logging and auditing

3. Questions  

Vendor and Security Services information
3.1	Company Name?
3.2	Point of Contact?
3.3	Web Site URL?
3.4	Product Name(s)?
3.5	Product Description?

Responses to the following questions should address Security Services capabilities.

3.6	Which service(s) does the product support? Be specific. For example: Product supports Policy Services (2.1), Policy Decision Service (2.1.1) and Policy Administration Service (2.1.3).
3.7	With which specifications listed above in the introduction do the products comply? With which version of each do your products comply?
3.8	Describe the scalability of each product. 

Responses to these questions will address some Government policy compliance

3.9	Have the products been National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) validated? If they have, to what level?
3.10	 If the products include a crypto module, are they FIPS 140-2 complaint?
3.11	 Are the products FIPS 186-2 compliant?

Responses to the following questions will address product maturity that can be useful in the lifecycle benefit and cost analysis. 

3.12	 What are the costs or rates for the products including integration engineering discussed in your response to this RFI?
3.13	 What is your company’s corporate support policy?
3.14	 Has a US Government organization used or sponsored the products?  If yes, provide POC.
3.15	  What are scheduled capability enhancements for the products in 2004 and 2005? 
3.16	 How are the products licensed (e.g., by seat, by platform)?

<DESC>W91207-04-R-0005 (San Francisco) THIS AMENDMENT IS BEING ISSUED TO CORRECT/CLARIFY TECHNICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CADD HARDWARE/SOFTWARE, AND TO MODIFY THE SELECTION CRITERIA FOR BOTH CONTRACTS TO BE AWARDED.  THIS AMENDMENT ALSO STATES THAT FIRMS MUST SUBMIT A SEPARATE SF330 IF THEY WAN T TO BE CONSIDERED FOR BOTH CONTRACTS.  FIRMS OTHER THAN SMALL BUSINESSES MAY SUBMIT AN SF 330 FOR REACH 12 IN THE EVENT THE SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE IS DISSOLVED, DUE TO INADEQUATE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED SMALL BUSINESSES SUBMITTING PROPOSALS.  THE DATE AND T IME SPECIFIED FOR RECEIPT OF SUBMITTALS REMAINS UNCHANGED. 1) CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  The San Francisco Distri ct plans to procure one unrestricted contract for the design of the Upper Guadalupe Flood Control Project and one Small Business Set-Aside contract for the design of Reach 12 of this same project.  The project extends approximately from the Union Pacific R ailroad Bridge to the Blossom Hill Road Bridge along the Guadalupe River located in San Jose, California.  Services required include preparation of plans and specifications and supporting basis of design, cost estimate, bid schedule, and engineering consid erations and instruction for field personnel, and services during construction phase (optional). The contractor shall be responsible for design and drawings using computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and delivering any two-dimensional drawings in Autodesk AutoCAD CADD software, release 2002 or higher as well as delivering any two or three dimensi onal drawings in Bentley MicroStation software, Version 8.1 or higher, electronic digital format.  The government will only accept the final product for full operation, without conversion or reformatting, in the Autodesk release 2002 format, or the Bentley  MicroStation format Version 8.1, and on the target platform specified herein.  The target platform is a Pentium III 500 MHz, 128 MB Ram, and 20 GB Hard Drive with a Windows 2000/XP operating system.  Advanced application software used in preparing drawing s shall be delivered in Version 8.1 Microstation electronic digital format. Drawings produced by scanning drawings of records or containing photographic images shall be delivered in a raster format compatible with the native Microstation I/RAS B, Version 8 .1 or higher, in electronic digital format. Drawing files shall also be delivered in Computer-aided Acquisition and Logistic Support (CALS) CCITT Group 4 raster format use Maxview 3.06 or higher to convert and view.  The specifications will be produced in SPECSINTACT with Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) using the Corps of Engineers Construction Guide Specifications.  Specification files shall also be received delivered in Adobe Acrobat Portable Data Format (PDF) or PostScript electronic digital format. Responding firms must show computer and modem capability for accessing the Construction Criteria Base (CCB) and the Design Review and Checking System (Dr. Checks).  The estimate will be prepared using the Corps of Engineers Computer Aided Cost Est imating System.  (M-CACES M-II Version software provided by the Government). 	This announcement will result in the award of two contracts.  One contract, for the design of the Upper Guadalupe Flood Control Project, NOT including Reach 12, will be awarded on an unrestricted basis.  One contract, for Reach 12, is set-aside for Small Business (SB).  In the event there are not at least 3 highly qualified SBs submitting for Reach 12, the SB Set-Aside for the Reach 12 contract will be dissolved, and a separate award will be made for Reach 12 on an unrestricted basis.  Except for SB firms that submit on the SB Set-Aside contract for Reach 12, firms interested in being considered for the Reach 12 contract if selection wil l be made on an unrestricted basis, must submit a separate SF 330, stating their intention to be considered for the Reach 12 if it converts to unrestricted.  All SBs that submit an SF 330 for the Small Business Set-Aside contract for Reach 12, will be cons idered for the Reach 12 contract should it become unrestricted, unless they specifically request not to be considered.  The Government reserves the right to award one contract for both parts of the project if selection on an unrestricted basis for both par ts would result in award to the same contractor.  The NAICS code for this announcement is 541330, which states the business size standard to be considered a small business is a maximum of $4.0 million of average annual receipts for its preceding 3 fiscal y ears.  All interested Architect-Engineers are reminded that in accordance with provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and s mall disadvantaged firms.  If a large business is selected, it must comply with FAR 52-219.9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it plans to subcontract.  The following subcontracting goals are the minimal acceptabl e goals to be included in the subcontracting plan.  Of the subcontracted work, 57.2% to small business, 10% to small disadvantaged business (subset of small business), 10% to women-owned small business (subset of small business), 3% to HUBZone Small Busine ss (subset of small business), and 3% to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (subset of small business).  If a selected large business size firm submits a plan with lesser goals, it must submit rationale of why the above goals were not met.  A de tailed plan is not required to be submitted with the SF 330, however, the plans to do so should be specified in Block H of the SF 330.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm or joint venture must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration  (CCR).  Register via the Internet Site at http://ccr.edi.disa.mil or by contacting the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.  This work will include all architectural-engineering (A-E) and related services necessary to complete the  design, and for A-E services during the construction phase (option). 2) PROJECT INFORMATION:  Work under these contracts shall include preparation of preliminary and final engineering analyses, designs, cost estimates, final plans and specifications, basis of design, and engineering considerations and instruction for field personnel (ECIFP) reports, and services during the construction phase.  The Upper Guadalupe Flood Control Project is divided into several reaches, beginning downstream with Reach 7 and ending upstream with Reach 12.  The design shall include a continuous o pen channel bypass approximately 5,000 feet long with a diversion weir at the upstream end, two reinforced concrete vehicular bridges over the open channel bypass as well as a reinforced concrete culvert adjacent to the existing Union Pacific Railroad (UPR R) Bridge.  Additional culverts will be included in the design for Ross and Canoas Creeks near their confluence to the Guadalupe River.  The design shall also include three short bypass channels with entrance and exit structures, river channel widening, le vees, floodwalls, maintenance roads, recreation trails, gabions, crib-wall and biotechnical bank protection, storm water drainage, utility relocation, invert stabilization structures, maintenance access ramps, fencing, riparian mitigation, landscaping, and  temporary irrigation. The design of Reach 12 must occur prior to the design of Reaches 7-11, and shall include the relocation and rebuilding of two levees, channel widening and realignment, wetland mitigation, and several acres of riparian forest mitigation.  The design shall a lso include the design of maintenance roads, recreation trai ls, gabion bank protection, storm water drainage, utility relocation, invert stabilization structures, and temporary irrigation.  Hydraulic analysis, geomorphic and sediment transport studies, and floodplain analysis may be included under both contracts to  support this design effort.  The plans and specifications for both projects will include environmental protection requirements including diversion of river flows during construction, water quality control, erosion control measures, and measures to protect endangered fish during constr uction.  The A-E firm shall coordinate with state, county, and local governments as well as other organizations or groups involved in the development and design of the proposed project.  Firms desiring consideration shall be experienced in engineering and design and have sound knowledge of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers principles and procedures for flood damage reduction, recreation, and environmental restoration projects.  The estimated construction cost of the Upper Guadalupe Flood Control Project (NOT inc luding Reach 12) is between 100 and 150 million dollars, and the estimated construction cost of Reach 12 is between 10 and 15 million dollars.  Construction of these projects will be a phased effort conducted over an approximate time of 9-10 years.

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center is hereby soliciting information from potential sources in regard to Deep Space Laser Communications.  NASA GSFC has recently initiated a Deep Space Laser Communication Earth Terminal Study under the sponsorship of the NASA Mission Offices for Space Operations (Code M) and Science (Code S).  This is intended to be a brief 6-month study addressing the following goals: 1.	To outline the designs for above-the-atmosphere earth terminals for implementing a deep space laser communications capability. 2.	To evaluate the platform options for a deep space laser communications capability, including airship, aircraft, independent satellites, or hosting by other NASA assets (ISS, TDRS, etc.). 3.	To determine whether a demonstration mission would be worthwhile, and if so, to identify the principal risks to be retired by such a mission. Current plans call for the Mars Laser Communication Demonstration terminal to be launched in 2009, as part of the Mars Telecommunications Orbiter mission.  This would provide the first operational remote terminal for testing (from Mars).  It is desirable that any demonstration mission be compatible with the MLCD schedule.  Additional information on MLCD can be obtained by contacting the technical points of contact listed below, or by following these links:  http://msp.gsfc.nasa.gov/integrator/450.htm#6   http://oemagazine.com/fromTheMagazine/apr04/eyeontech.html   http://link.aip.org/link/?PSISDG/5338/16/1  As a part of the study, NASA is currently seeking information for technology planning, risk assessment, and cost estimation for potential “above the atmosphere” Earth terminals for laser communication.  Specific areas where information is requested are: 1.	Communication packages, including beacon/uplink capabilities (MLCD compatibility will likely be required, although alternative approaches are of interest as well.) 2.	Telescope configurations (effective area equivalent to 2-3 meter class required.) 3.	Pointing, acquisition, tracking, and control strategies. 4.	Baffling, filtering, and other techniques to enable telescope operation within 3 degrees of the Sun. 5.	Platform vibration isolation technologies for meeting stringent stability requirements for the optical platform. 6.	Integration of telescope and platform; overall configuration. 7.	Operational architecture. The exact configuration of the operational nodes will depend on the detailed design considered (e.g., stratosphere or space).  However, a key aspect of the study is establishing whether a risk mitigation mission is required before implementation.  Thus, the technology readiness level of all referenced subsystems should be elaborated upon. If a demonstration mission is deemed desirable, its launch date can be assumed to be commensurate with the MLCD schedule. Inputs from industry are requested by November 26, 2004, or earlier.  Information received after that date will also be useful, but with potentially less impact. Companies interested in describing their technology or any other relevant information to NASA are encouraged to supply documentation in a format of their choosing.

<SUBJECT>59 -- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) HIGH DATA RATE-RADIO FREQUENCY (HDR-RF) CAPABILITY AND MODEM
<SOLNBR>ESC-NI4M-HDR-RF-001
<RESPDATE>103004
<ARCHDATE>12302004
<CONTACT>POINT OF CONTACT: Mr. Frank W. Holmes Jr. (Senior Operations Analyst), 781-271-8570, email (frank.holmesjr@hanscom.af.mil)
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A SOLICITATION. The Government is requesting information from companies working on terminal system modem designs for High Data Rate Radio Frequency (HDR-RF) communications for ground-to-air and ground to space tactical applications The Government wishes to determine potential sources for the development of an HDR ground terminal modem. <br><br> INTRODUCTION: The Air Force is looking for technical expertise and products that will enable the start of the development of an HDR Ground capability in FY05, with an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY08 to compliment the Wideband Gapfiller Satellite 4 (WGS4) launch in FY09. An HDR modem is required to support both ground to air and ground-to-space communications for Tactical Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft and Command and Control (C2) aircraft. This modem must be compliant with Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Software Communications Architecture (SCA) architecture version 3.0.  In addition to the waveforms associated with WGS satellites, the modem must be able to support, through SCA reprogramability, future Transformational Satellite (TSAT) waveforms. The HDR modem must achieve a variable data rate capability up to 274 Mbps (at least for the receiving end).  The modem must have enough processing capability to achieve these data rates in the presence of turbo decoders.  The HDR modem will be based upon open, industry standard interfaces and will be controlled and monitored from a variety of existing and Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) applications. This RFI will be used by ESC/NI4 in the development of an acquisition strategy for an HDR-RF ground capability. The Air Force is seeking industry's help in determining the optimum approach to achieving a Tactical Ground capability of operating at the high data rate described above. Both, the option to integrate HDR-RF modem capabilities into an existing ground satellite Non-Developmental Item (NDI) terminals and the development of a new terminal with the enhanced capability should be explored. Your rationale for the preferred approach would be a key element in the development of our acquisition strategy. <br><br> SCOPE: The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to support an RFP release for an HDR-RF ground capability by the end of FY '05, and to determine industry interest in participating in this effort. The potential provider/developers should understand that validated and firm requirements for the HDR-RF ground capability and/or modems do not yet exist. Rather, they will evolve over time as the technology evolves and matures, and the technical requirements, user requirements and Concept Of Operations (CONOPS) are defined. ESC/NI4 will use the information gathered in response to this RFI to gain an understanding of potential approaches to meet USAF HDR ground terminal system requirements. We seek to understand the current state of the art that companies have achieved in HDR-RF ground communications, as well as their anticipated future development, various alternative innovative and creative solutions, and how these might apply to the USAF effort to achieve this capability.  ESC/NI4 seeks to solicit the interest of vendors, organizations and/or consortia in the following areas of expertise: <br><br> 1.	Ground Tactical Modems <br> 2.	Software Programmable modem (modulator/demodulator) design <br> 3. SCA Modem architecture design. <br> 4. Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) development. <br> 5. Interface Standards between the HDR modem and a terminal's antenna system. <br> 6. Interface Standards between the HDR modem and a terminal's user connections to include control/monitor. <br> 7. Support for IPv6, JTRS NSL, and other standards based inter-networking. <br><br> DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: The Information package should include the following items: <br><br> 1. Statement of interest, either as a Prime- or a Sub-contractor/partner/team member. <br> 2. Description of qualification: Projects, Products, Applicable experience. <br> 3.  Your comments/recommendations to achieve capability described above. <br> 4.  Thorough description of existing or planned SCA compliant HDR modems. <br> 5. Critical technologies and/or hurdles to be cleared. <br> 6. Risks and risk mitigation strategies. <br> 7. Plans to utilize DOD's acquisition methodology of Cost As an Independent Variable (CAIV) making technical and schedule performance a function of available (budgeted) resources as outlined below: CAIV Strategy: Aggressively set realistic cost objectives for acquiring and supporting defense systems and manage programs to meet those objectives.<br> CAIV Approach:  Set realistic but aggressive cost objectives early in each program, manage risks to achieve cost, schedule and performance objectives, and devise metrics for tracking progress in setting and achieving cost objectives. <br> 8. Obsolescent parts strategy. <br> 9. Issues or concerns not identified above. <br><br> INDUSTRY DAYS:  An Industry Day will be held at the MITRE facility, Bedford MA, to discuss high-level program strategy with those companies expressing interest. Follow-on one-on-one sessions will follow. Requests for attendance to the Industry Day and also for a one-on-one session should be made no later than 1700 on 18 October 2004 to Mr. Frank W. Holmes Jr., Senior Operations Analyst, 781-271-8570, email (frank.holmesjr@hanscom.af.mil), or mailed to the address listed above. Additional Industry Day attendee information will be posted at the Hanscom AFB electronic bulletin board website (www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil). <br><br> The information received will not obligate the Government in any manner nor will the Government reimburse contractors for any costs associated with submittal of the requested information. This request does not constitute an Invitation For Bid or a Request For Proposal. <br><br> Responses to this RFI are due to Ms. Kathleen Munroe (Contracting Officer) by Close OF Business 30 October, 2004.

<DESC>This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled “Solicitation for Information and Planning Purposes.”  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time. The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is the first mission under the Living With a Star program as part of the Sun-Earth Connection.  SDO will be made up of several instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun, thus enhancing NASA’s understanding of the solar process and space weather.  SDO is viewed as a follow-on to the successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission.  It will be a three-axis stabilized satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105 degrees longitude and having an inclination of 28.5 degrees.  SDO will have a mission life of 5 years, and currently, is scheduled for launch in April 2008. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is soliciting comments on requirements established regarding the SDO Communications Subsystem S-Band Transponder/Diplexer.  The present requirements are specified in the attached documents: Exhibit 1 – Statement of Work for SDO Project S-Band Transponder/Diplexer (464-COMM-LEGL-0047), Exhibit 2 – Performance Specification S-Band Transponder/Diplexer SDO Project (464-COMM-SPEC-0046), and Exhibit 3 – S-Band Transponder/Diplexer Deliverable Items List and Schedule (DILS) SDO Project. This notice is issued by the NASA GSFC to post a draft SOW, Specification, and DILS via the Internet, and to solicit input and recommendations from interested parties.  The objective of this RFI is to gather information that promotes competition and increases procurement efficiency by improving NASA GSFC’s knowledge of industry’s capabilities.  NASA GSFC invites potential offerors to submit information that may be used to determine eligibility to be participants in feedback sessions with the SDO project.  This procedure is described in FAR Part 15.202.  The intent of the sessions is to provide dialogue in which participants can provide feedback on NASA GSFC requirements and its acquisition approach.  The compilation of submitted information may be factored along with SDO requirements to refine the aforementioned SOW (Exhibit 1), Specification (Exhibit 2), and DILS (Exhibit 3). Potential offerors are requested to submit information in the form of a brief Capabilities and Qualifications Statement that includes: 1) Capability to comply with the present requirements outlined in the Performance Specification and SOW.  Requirements that are not in compliance should be noted with brief comment that either describe how a potential offeror’s S-Band Transponder/Diplexer could be brought into compliance or state the potential offeror’s position on such requirement.  This would serve as a main topic in one-on-one feedback sessions.  It should also be stated as to whether certain requirements are cost drivers or increase risk and as to whether or not a fixed-price contract would be acceptable.  2) Capability to meet the hardware deliverable schedule, and 3) Summary of past relevant experience in developing S-Band Transponders/Diplexers.  Please advise if this requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in Internet “Note A”. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto. This notice constitutes all information concerning the SDO Communications Subsystem S-Band Transponder/Diplexer that will be furnished at this time.  Interested firms are requested to submit their capability statements to Ms. Lorrie Eakin, by email at Lorrie.L.Eakin@nasa.gov no later than the response date indicated above.  Documents, comments, and questions may be forwarded to Ms. Eakin via electronic transmission or by facsimile transmission.  In addition, copies of all documents shall also be forwarded to Ms. Maria Lecha, at NASA GSFC, Mail Code 567, Greenbelt, MD  20771, or by e-mail at Maria.C.Lecha@nasa.gov.  When responding reference the number above (e.g., SDO-XXXX-XXX-XXXX). This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, or will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.  Respondents will not be notified of the final results from the one-on-one discussions.  An ombudsman has been appointed—See NASA Specific Note “B”.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 2000 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA GSFC Business Opportunities home page is     http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=51	 .  It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

The focus of the future handgun system (FHS) is to augment close quarters  battle and security/force protection operations, and to offer significant  improvements over the current handgun system. Additionally, the FHS will  support the requirement for a personal defense weapon.  The FHS will provide  increases in terminal ballistic potential, durability, and reliability over the  currently fielded M9/9x19mm and M11/9x19mm pistols. Specific features and  characteristics of the FHS will include, but are not limited to, an integral  accessory rail, enhanced day/night sighting capability, configurable grips (to  suit the individual soldier’s need), and will permit the use of a sound  suppressor when the threat/mission requires. The FHS will use munitions that  are optimized for Army full-spectrum contingencies/applications. The FHS will  also have a suitable, multi-configurable, holster(s) and ammunition carrier(s). Information about existing production pistols and/or pistols of this type that  are currently in development and associated ammunition that offers increased  terminal ballistic potential is desired.   Interested parties are requested to submit a description of their product(s) along with other available information (sketches, drawings, specifications,  brochures, and/or test results that describe current capability/on-going  development) to:  U.S. Army ARDEC, ATTN: David J.

<SUBJECT>R -- 514-04-022 sole source modification
<DESC>USAID/Colombia intends to award a Sole Source modification to ARD, Inc. under Contract No. 514-C-00-02-00213-00. The estimated amount of this modification is US$4,750,000.00. The above Contract was awarded to ARD Inc., on a sole source basis using notwithstanding authority, on March 1, 2002 and the estimated completion date is February 28, 2006. The total estimated contract amount is US$27,400,948.00. 
The purpose of the above contract is to provide technical assistance, training and small infrastructure grant support to municipal governments in Colombia in USAID-identified strategic regions.  This should be based on work done to date under a USAID/Colombia contract with Associates in Rural Development (ARD).  The purpose of this modification is to provide additional resources that will expand the LOE in the existing program from 126 to 213 person months in order to (a) continue activities in geographic areas that were initially scheduled for close-out in 2004 (e.g., departments of Putumayo, Caquetá, Cauca, Huila, Bolívar, Tolima, Antioquia) and (b) add activities in other priority geographic areas, pursuant to a shift in emphasis of USAID/Colombia’s current democracy and governance strategy.  At the request of the United States Congress, activities under the existing Legislative Strengthening Program will be expanded to focus on Afro-Colombian groups, and to initiate new limited activities in the Valle de Cauca.   Additionally, the modification will include a Land Registry Component under the existing contract.
USAID intends to negotiate this modification with only one source under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5), where an award is for the continued provision of highly specialized services and award to another source would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable project delays. The required services include continuation and expansion of services of the same nature as described in the original statement of work of the original contract. 
This notice is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement in accordance with numbered note 22. Any information received will be considered for the purpose of conducting a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR EXPEDITIONARY  WARFARE AND COASTAL OPERATIONS
<DESC>NSWC Panama City BAA-04-01 Expeditionary Warfare and Coastal Operations(1 Oct 2004) The Naval Sea Systems Command, Panama City (NAVSEA Panama City) conducts research and development of techniques and technologies directed toward operations in a littoral environment in support of expeditionary warfare and coastal operations. NAVSEA Panama City’s mission includes mine warfare (both mine countermeasures (MCM) and mining), amphibious warfare, diving and life support, special warfare, and other missions conducted in the coastal region. Within these mission areas, NAVSEA Panama City is responsible for the full spectrum of research, development and acquisition, and support functions. Typical functions include fundamental research; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; and development of operational concepts and tactics. NAVSEA Panama City is interested in receiving proposals for research and development in all of its mission areas. This notice constitutes a Br! oad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)2. It is intended that this BAA be open from 1 Oct 2004 to 30 Sep 2005. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: (1) environmental data collection, monitoring, analysis, or display; (2) multifunction underwater sensing designs and technology; (3) image and sensor data processing; (4) modeling and simulation; (5) innovative conventional and non-conventional systems for MCM, amphibious warfare, naval mining, diving and life support, homeland security, force protection or special warfare tactics, techniques, procedures applicable to all phases of the battle timeline including surveillance, targeting, acquisition, and all terminal phases including amphibious logistics and the moving of cargo from afloat to ashore, consistent with ship-to-objective-maneuver and sea basing concepts; (6) shipboard system modular integration concepts; (7) innovative and non conventional concepts for application of techno! logy, engineering and systems to  of coastal operations and coastal warfare including waterproofing, shock mitigation and isolation, and human systems interfaces; (8) lasers, radar, millimeter wave, or other high energy sensors or weapons; (9) command, control, communication, localization, navigation, guidance and data transmission  in the air, sea, or thru the ground; (10) concepts and systems for remote control of sea mines; (11) autonomous and remotely controlled vehicles: air, surface, sea surface, undersea or ground; (12) Techniques or methods to increase the autonomy of current unmanned vehicles (air, surface, sea surface, or ground); (13) information processing, fusion, and display;  (14) data fusion/correlation for applications involving methodologies to translate/correlate data between different acoustic sensors/frequencies so that data/images taken with one sensor can be translated into equivalent data/images with another system; (15) Chemical / Biological individual protection; (16) Kinetic and mechanistic studies of atmospheric transformations in enclosed environments;  Proposals may be submitted by any commercial firm, Institution of higher education (other than federal government) with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such entities. NAVSEA Panama City encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities. The following guidelines apply to concept papers or proposals. Typically each proposal may be: (1) funded incrementally for periods up to three years subject to the availability of appropriations; (2) on average, be funded between $10,000 to $1,000,000, with the size of each dependent upon the topic (although NAVSEA Panama City reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds); (3) more than one effort may be funded for an individual topic; (4) NAVSEA Panama City is not interested in concepts that already have been developed or proven (even if they never have been sold before); (5) NAVSEA Panama City is seeking proposals for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding; and (6) deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation rather than focus on a specific system or hardware solution. Proposals for evolutionary engineering of ! improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and are not allowed. In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as an initial step, interested parties should submit concept or  white  papers briefly summarizing the technical direction, relevance and scope of the proposed effort, and a brief synopsis of qualifications based on accomplishments, and provide a rough order of magnitude cost. White papers should be no more than 5-7 pages in length. White papers (and any resulting proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific, technical, and socio-economic merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential naval relevance and contributions of the effort to NAVSEA Panama City’s specific mission areas; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to NAVSEA Panama City programs are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed ef! fort are to be delivered to NAVSEA Panama City with unrestricted (Government Purpose) rights; (4) The offerors capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; (6) Realism of the proposed cost and the availability of funds. Based on evaluation of the White papers, participants may be selected and invited to submit full technical and cost proposals for evaluation by NAVSEA Panama City using the above noted evaluation criteria. An invitation to submit a full proposal does not guarantee funding. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. For efforts funded as legally binding commitments, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will includ! e the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities. This is to notify potential proposers that each grant or cooperative agreement that may be placed under this announcement or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause:  As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents, the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students. If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558 of Public!  Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements, and it may suspend or terminate such grants and agreements unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award.  If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any grant, including any existing grant; (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a grant or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation.

<SUBJECT>R -- Performance-Based Contract for Technical Services for the Operation and Maintenance of the Marine Observation Network
<DESC>This is a Special Notice to announce the upcoming solicitation by the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) for the recompetition of the NDBC Technical Services Contract.  NDBC is located on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, at John C. Stennis Space Center in Bay St. Louis.  NDBC is comprised of a combination of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) civil service employees, U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) personnel, and a service contractor.  Working as an integrated team, NDBC manages the development, operations, and maintenance of the Marine Observation Network (MON), in direct support of the Marine Observation Program (MOP).  This team serves as the NOAA focal point for data buoy and associated meteorological and environmental monitoring.  The MON is an integrated, sustained ocean observation and information delivery system that serves U.S. coastal waters, as well as the offshore waters of Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Great Lakes.  The MON is a component of NOAA’s National backbone for marine observations.  The system consists of headland and moored buoy data acquisition platforms, real-time processing and information quality control, and product delivery systems.  The delivery system components include; moored buoys, coastal marine automated network (CMAN) sites, Voluntary Observing Ships (VOS), and oceanographic drifting buoys and subsurface oceanographic “floats.”  NDBC requires technical services to provide uninterrupted delivery of high quality, real-time environmental data to the operational elements of the NOAA and National Weather Service (NWS) for weather and ocean forecasts and warnings and for climate variability indications and assessments to a broader customer base.  The technical services contractor is expected to provide Engineering, Operational, Logistical, and Information Technology support to operate and maintain the MON.  This will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract that has a $500,000,000 ceiling that includes a 5-year base contract and 5-award term years.  The minimum guarantee for this IDIQ is $250,000 over the life of the contract.  NDBC’s existing requirement is approximately $10,000,000 per year.  However, the Nation is concentrating on improving the quality and understanding of the global ocean and NOAA is interested in increasing and improving their present ocean observation capability.  Based on the national dialogue, NDBC predicts a three-to-five fold increase in its capability requirements in the next 10 years. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 561210 - Facility Support Services. The Small Business Size Standard is $30M. The acquisition will be unrestricted. All offerors classified as large business shall submit a subcontracting plan for utilization of small businesses. The subcontracting goals can be found at http://www.osec.doc.gov/osdbu/Accomplishments.htm. NDBC plans to release a draft solicitation on or about 08/31/04. Following the release of this draft solicitation, NDBC will host an Industry Day at Stennis Space Center, MS on 09/15/04. The Industry Day will provide valuable information about our mission, the terms and conditions of the upcoming solicitation, and a chance to meet the members of our team. Further, you will have an opportunity to ask questions and provide feedback about the draft solicitation. In order to receive the draft solicitation and attend Industry Day, you must register with this website no later than close of business Wednesday, 09/01/04.

<DESC>This notice is to inform all interested vendors that the USDA, Forest Service, Washington Office of Acquisition Management, Fire and Aviation Support Branch, located at the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) in Boise, Idaho, will be re-soliciting National Wildland Fire Engine and National Firefighter Crew services.  We anticipate soliciting offers and awarding contracts for the upcoming 2005 fire season.  

Interested vendors are encouraged to monitor the Government advertising Federal Business Opportunities Internet website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to view upcoming related information (such as information meeting notices, solicitations, amendments to solicitations, etc.).  Please be aware that hard-copy notices, pre-solicitation notices, solicitations, or mailing lists are no longer issued/maintained by our office.  Therefore, it is imperative that vendors have Internet capability and monitor the Federal Business Opportunities website periodically if they wish to participate.  We recommend that anyone interested in these two upcoming acquisitions check the website at least once a week, to ensure important advertisements are not missed.  If you or your staff have any difficulty in finding the FEDBIZOPPS website, or the NIFC posted advertisements, please call Chris Kirk at (208) 387-5665 or myself for help.  It is best to do this when both parties are on computers, so that we can walk through navigation to the site together.

Please note that the Request for Proposals have not been completed or published for either requirement at this time, and this notice is NOT a request for offers/proposals.  I am the Contracting Officer assigned to finish the administration of the current National Wildland Engine and National Firefighter Crew contracts and re-solicit the future services.  If you have any questions, I can be reached at (208) 387-5612.

<DESC>Operational Contracting, US Air Force Academy proposes a contract action (base plus three option periods) for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate under authority of FAR 6.302-3 with only Jeol USA, Inc for electron microscope maintenance and repair services.  Jeol USA, Inc. has been found to be the only vendor who can provide these services in support of already installed Jeol Electron microscope equipment in use at the USAF Academy.  Jeol USA, Inc. is the only vendor found who can support this requirement.  Supplies and/or services are available from only one responsible source.  No other type of supply or service will satisfy agency requirements.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals, however interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet this requirement for the Government's consideration.  If no response is received by 4 October 2004  04:00PM, MDT, to the effect that comparable support services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these supplies and or services through a sole source procurement with Jeol USA, Inc., a sole source award will be made.

<SUBJECT>D -- Public Information:  Advance Notice of the FDA Structured Product Labeling Project - Request for Information
<DESC>The GSA Federal Systems Integration and Management Center (FEDSIM) on behalf of the Food and Drug Administration plans to release a Request For Information (RFI) for the Structured Product Labeling (SPL) Project.  The overall objective of the FDA Structured Product Labeling project is to create a technological environment that will enable FDA to reliably generate up-to-date SPL for all drug products marketed in the United States. (Future phase can potentially concentrate on other FDA-regulated products including vaccines, animal drug products, dietary supplements and medical devices.)  SPL contains the following medication information:   (1) How to use medication – dosing recommendations and monitoring use; (2) When to use medication – indication, clinical effects (e.g., interactions and adverse events), activity (e.g., mechanism of action), other information about the use of the medication; (3) Description of the medication – names, ingredients, strength, appearance, dosage form;  (4) How the medication is supplied – name, package type, quantity; and (5) Distributor of the medication.     Achieving this objective will require changes to existing regulations, development of standards, creation of computer systems, training and education inside and outside of FDA, improvements to the current processes for the review and approval of labeling changes and improvements to the current processes for data entry and quality control of drug listing. 
Purpose:  The purpose of the SPL RFI will be to assist the Food and Drug Administration in identifying possible technical alternatives that will assist in developing Computer Systems.
SPL RFI Release Date: October 15, 2004.   RFI Responses will be due by October 29, 2004.  For more information, visit the following web site:  http://www.fda.gov/oc/datacouncil/spl.html  This web site contains links to SPL Guidance, Implementation Guide (draft), and other pertinent information.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued.     Solicitation number FE309942450018 is hereby issued as a Request for Quotation. Submit written offers only, oral offers will not be accepted. All firms or individuals responding must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).     This combined synopsis/solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24 and Defense Acquisition Circular 91-13 (Correction).     It is the contractor?s responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions. Clauses and provisions can be found at: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vffar1.htm.     This acquisition is 100% Small Business Set-Aside. North American Industrial Classification Standard: 333415 with a small Business Size Standard of 750 employees. CLIN (0001) Air Conditioner, Portable, (1 Each); 
-       25 Ton Capacity; 9600 CFM -Air Cooled DX unit; no heat 
-       Diesel-Generated Power and Fuel Tank w/hail guard - On Flat Bed Trailer with gooseneck hitch
-       Duct Openings: 2 x 20-inch Supply, 2 x 20-inch Return 
-       Dual electrical capabilities: primarily hooked up to generator power, but have the ability to run 75-100' of cable to a facility (including cable).
-       Flex duct should fit inside a weather proof box, and duct material should be weather resistance (an insulated if possible)
-       Each section of duct should be in 25-foot sections (interlocking collars)-up to 100 foot (on supply and return) and should hook directly to the AC unit.
-       Sized to have multi-stages (2-4 compressors).
-       Controlled with a thermostat and a return air controller. The preferred type of thermostat is one that can receive/send signals back to the package unit remotely (some type of infrared/antenna/radio freq-provide options).
-       Provide start-up and training.
- As a result from questions already submitted, here are a few Q/A's.
Question (Part 1):
1. Please advise the capacity of the Generator you need for this portable a/c unit?
2. Do you intend to use the generator to power any other devise or need 120-volt outlets? 
3. I understand total Duct you will want is 200 feet (100 ea for supply & return) if they are insulated it will be hard to store them, as it will not be as flexible. 

Answers (Part 1): 
1. The capacity of the generator should be at least 50KW.         

2. The generator and the AC unit will primarily be dedicated to each other.     However in the case of an emergency, we would like the flexibility to connecting the AC unit to a building power source and to connect just the generator to other power requirements.   
           
3. Insulated ducting is preferred if we can easily store it, but it is not necessary - un-insulated flex ducting will work.     The quantity required per duct is 100 ft (one supply and one return = 200 total ft, two supplies and two returns = 400 total ft, etc).     The ductwork should be in 25 ft sections with interlocking collars.     Weatherproof storage on the trailer for the ductwork needs to be included.

Question (Part 2): 
1. What is the minimum continuous operation time before re-fueling?     

2. What is the maximum trailer length?     What is your ideal trailer length?     

3. Are you OK with tongue weight or do you want a four-wheel trailer?     

4. For shore power, do you want 480VAC 3 Phase pin and sleeve connector or something else?     

5. What is the ambient operating temperature?     

Answers (Part 2): 
1. 24 hours

2. The trailer should be long enough to hold the AC unit, the generator, the fuel tank, and the container for the flex ducting and cables.

3. Trailer should be gooseneck and sufficient for the load.     Two tandem axles are recommended.     

4. The extra generator outlet (for powering devices other than the AC unit) should be 120V / 20-30 Amp. The alternate power for the AC unit should be whatever the unit requires.

5. 95?F, 105?F?     70-110?F

Questions (Part 3):

1. With the ambient temperature being high at your location, we feel that insulated flex duct is a relative necessity if you're running 100 feet. However, storing 400 feet of insulated duct (which doesn't compress as much as uninsulated) on the trailer creates a need for a significantly bigger trailer. With this in mind, which is more important in your mind: Size of the trailer, or insulated duct? What about utilizing a 2nd small trailer for duct storage?  

2. Handling 20" duct, even in 25' sections, will be quite a bit of work and cause workers quite a bit of grief. Have you considered utilizing a chiller on the trailer, with a remote evaporator coil/fan that can be wheeled to the building, with just two glycol hoses running to/from the trailer? If this option is acceptable, may we submit an alternate quote utilizing this design?  

Answers (Part 3):

1. The unit, generator, and all needed ducting and cords must be stored on the trailer.  We would welcome a proposal that presents both options of uninsulated and insulated ducting.

2. At this time, we intend to proceed with a package unit, but we would welcome any additional ideas that you think might better fulfill our needs.
