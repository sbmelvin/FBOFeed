<DESC>BAA 06 - The Navy is seeking to develop advanced propulsion technologies that are applicable to augmented and non-augmented turbofan/turbojet engines, turboprop/turboshaft engines;  to develop advanced materials to support propulsion components technologies for application in high performance gas turbine engines; to develop propulsion and power system prognostic, diagnostic, and health monitoring technologies to improve aircraft safety, reliability, maintainability, affordability, and availability; and to develop and demonstrate advanced power system technologies that will significantly improve power density, available power, efficiency, reliability, readiness, service life, environmental compliance, safety-of-flight, and ownership costs.  Also, Naval ship and shore activities currently utilize the Combined Contaminated Fuel Detector (CCFD) and other shipboard compatible tests for determining the acceptability of a fuel for acceptance/ issue.

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) encourages educational institutions, Small Business Concerns (SBs), Small Disadvantaged Business concerns (SDBs),  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Women Owned Businesses, and Minority Institutions (MIs), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business concerns to submit research proposals for consideration.


TWO STEP BAA PROCESS

White Papers

NAVAIR uses a "Two Step" BAA evaluation process. Offerors must first submit White Papers (WPs), giving an overview (as applicable) of the technical approach, risks, milestones, and cost estimate. The purpose of an WP is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest.  Due to a volatile budget environment, interested offerors should first contact the technical points of contact to ensure that interest and funding exists for new awards. Offerors of those WPs found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a Formal Cost and Technical Proposal. An invitation does not assure an offeror of a subsequent contract award. For more information, please see BAA Guide which shortly will be posted at www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations.

To the best of the Government?s knowledge The Society for Research in Child Development is the only organization that can provide a qualified SRCD Executive Branch Fellow with expertise in child development research beginning in September 2006 as required by the NICHD.  The SRCD was founded in 1933 to advance research in child development, to foster an interdisciplinary consideration of substantive and methodological problems in the field of child development, and to encourage applications of research findings. The Society publishes two journals, a newsletter, a membership directory, and a social policy report; holds biennial meetings in March or April of odd-numbered years; sponsors conferences; and supports a Washington, DC-based Policy and Communications Office. Its membership of more than 5,600 is representative of the various disciplines and professions that contribute to knowledge of child development.  Under the guidance of the Committee on Policy and Communications, the Society helps to bring the results of research to bear on the formulation of public policy affecting children and families. One way this is done is through the Society for Research in Child Development Policy Fellowships. Since 1978, the SRCD has recruited and facilitated the placement of more than 90 AAAS Congressional and, since 1991, Executive Branch Fellows. The goals of these fellowships are to contribute to the effective use of scientific knowledge in developing public policy, to educate the scientific community about the development of public policy, and to establish a more effective liaison between scientists and the federal policy-making mechanisms.

<DESC>On February 22, 2006, NASA released a synopsis to potential offerors of the Agency’s planned procurement strategy for the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM).  NASA is now revising the acquisition approach for LDCM to include separate procurements for the instrument, spacecraft, and mission operations elements. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) will serve as the system integrator for the mission and launch services will be provided by the NASA Launch Services (NLS) contract managed by the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). NASA plans to issue an openly competed Request for Proposal (RFP) for the instrument element before the end of CY 2006 that will result in a cost reimbursable contract award in CY 2007. NASA continues to assess alternatives for the inclusion of a thermal spectrum sensing capability. NASA plans to use the Rapid Spacecraft Development Office (RSDO) contract to acquire the LDCM spacecraft element.  An RSDO “On-Ramp” solicitation will be issued to permit all qualified spacecraft vendors to be added to the current RSDO catalog.  The LDCM will be one of the first spacecraft procured through RSDO after this “On Ramp” process is completed.  We anticipate that the LDCM RSDO spacecraft will be awarded in the 4th quarter of CY 2007. Additionally, NASA in coordination with the US Geological Survey (USGS) plans to issue a separate RFP for the LDCM Mission Operations Element (MOE) that is anticipated to be awarded in the 4th quarter of CY 2007. NASA plans to issue all the solicitations with 5 one-year options for extended sustaining engineering support. The LDCM will have a 5-year mission life with 10-year expendable provisions. Following a prescribed on-orbit verification period, NASA plans to transfer ownership of the observatory and the associated contracts to the USGS, which will then operate the spacecraft and manage the data. Opportunity for industry comment on the instrument and mission element solicitations will be provided when draft versions of each RFP are released for comment.

A firm fixed price purchase order will result from the award of this RFQ.  The NAICS code is 541620.   STATEMENT OF WORK I.   Project Identification:  Technical Support  Services for Air Quality Science Assessment for Oxides of Nitrogen: Toxicology II.  Period of Performance:  Award date to November 15, 2008 IV.  Estimated Level of Effort:  573 hours for Tasks 1-6 (74 hours for Optional Task 7-9) BACKGROUND The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the  National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  As part of this process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) review and integrate new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science  Assessment (SA), historically known as a Criteria Document.   The EPA is now in the process of reviewing the NAAQS for NO2.  On April 30, 1971, the EPA promulgated primary and secondary NAAQS for NO2 at 0.053 parts per million (ppm), annual average, based on the findings outlined in the 1971 NO2  Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). In 1982, EPA published Air Quality Criteria for Oxides of Nitrogen (EPA, 1982), which updated the scientific criteria upon which the initial standards were based. On February 23, 1984, EPA proposed to retain this standard which was finalized on June 19, 1985.   The most recent review of the science on nitrogen oxides is included in the 1993 Air Quality Criteria for Oxides of Nitrogen (EPA-600/8-91/049cF).  In this review, the Administrator announced a final decision not to revise the standards on October 2, 1995.  The schedule for the current review of  the NAAQS for NO2 is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be established as a court-ordered schedule.  The EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the NO2 SA by July 2008, in order to provide the scientific basis for re-evaluation of the NO2 air quality  standard.  The EPA's proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for interim steps in the development of the NO2 SA, including completion of the first draft of the NO2 SA by July 2007. The scientific information on nitrogen oxides will be reviewed and summarized in a Science  Assessment Support Document (SASD) and the Science Assessment (SA).  The first draft of the SASD will be reviewed at an author review meeting sponsored by the EPA. This draft SASD will be revised to produce a peer review draft that will be reviewed by peer reviewers at a public meeting. Peer review  comments will be incorporated in the draft final SASD.  From this, the SA (a focused integrative document) will be prepared as an external review draft for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), and for public comment. The EPA  anticipates preparing two drafts of the NO2 SA for public and CASAC review before completion of the final NO2 SA. The Contractor shall review, critically evaluate and integrate the available scientific database on oxides of nitrogen physical and chemical properties, measurement methods,  environmental sources, concentrations, and pathways to human exposure, environmental effects, toxicological and human effects, and an evaluation of health risks to include public health significance. The Contractor shall accomplish the tasks described in the preceding paragraph, with respect to  assessing human health risks from oxides of nitrogen exposure. ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments, the EPA could not post the entire information to the Fed Biz Opps website.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mrs. Sri Woro B. Harijono, Director General, Badan Meteorologi dan Geofisika, Jl. Angkasa I No 2, Kemayoran, Jakarta pusat 10720, Indonesia, Phone: (62-21) 654-2983, Fax: (62-21) 654-2983, E-mail: sriworo@bmg.go.id, sriworo@onebox.com

National Emergency Communications Strategy.  Badan Meteorologi dan Geofisika (BMG), Indonesia's Meteorological and Geophysics Agency, the Grantee, invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Technical Assistance for the development of a strategy for emergency communications in Indonesia.

This technical assistance will assist BMG in developing an effective strategy to communicate critical emergency information to communities on impending natural disasters.  

Of the countries affected by the December 2004 tsunami, Indonesia sustained the greatest amount of damage, both in terms of the number of fatalities (over 160,000) and loss of property (nearly $4.5 billion).  Thus far in 2006, the country has experienced five major earthquakes, one of which caused over 5,000 deaths and substantial destruction in central Java, and another of which created a tsunami which caused over 500 deaths and displaced thousands in southern Java.  While the Indonesian government has promised to establish an effective warning system, the country faces significant challenges in implementing such a network, as its large population is spread over a vast archipelago located in one of the world's most active locations for seismic activity.  

Although donations from the international community have improved Indonesia's capabilities, significant gaps remain.  U.S. Trade and Development Agency's (USTDA) $650,000 grant to BMG in 2005 addressed command and control procedures and systems integration, and concentrated on the "upstream" collection of data from the regional warning system.  Therefore, a clear unmet need remains the articulation of a "downstream" national emergency communications strategy, which this project would address. This project would involve aspects such as ensuring reliable communications between BMG and Bakornas (the national disaster management agency), linking the national operations center in Jakarta with the ten planned regional operations centers, notifying and maintaining communications with first responders and local authorities, providing mobile communications capability for emergency personnel if public communications solutions fail, and providing automated control of coastal warning sirens in high-risk zones.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $391,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM LOCAL TIME, DECEMBER 15, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 07 should be submitted by 4 Dec 06; FY 08 by 1 Oct 07; FY 09 by 1 Oct 08; FY10 by 1 Oct 09; and FY11 by 1 Oct 10.  White papers will be accepted until 2 p.m. Eastern time on 1 May 2011, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.

I.     FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)/IF, in conjunction with the Intelligence Community's Disruptive Technology Office (DTO), is soliciting white papers for innovative, creative, and high-risk research to advance the state-of-the-art in technologies and methods for Proactive Intelligence (PAINT).

Background

The Intelligence Community has a central mission to help the nation avoid strategic national security surprise.  Strategic surprises may come in the form of deliberate actions by adversaries of the United States, or they may emerge as unanticipated consequences brought about by the convergence or emergence of innocuous technological, economic, demographic, political, or natural forces.  In each case, it falls to intelligence analysts to spot the indicators or informal signs of situations that may threaten the US in the ever-growing volume, variety and complexity of data; to organize the indicators and findings into a coherent picture; to support accurate predictions of future situations and their potential impacts; and to identify factors influencing the evolution of the situation.

Technologies are needed which facilitate integration of diverse data into a coherent picture for analysis of future developments, and for collaboration among individuals and agencies.  To address this need, the PAINT vision is for an integrated intelligence capability enabling policy-makers and operational users to better comprehend the present and to understand and more effectively shape the future.  Thus, PAINT provides integrated intelligence that anticipates developments of strategic concern and identifies opportunities as well as vulnerabilities.

The purpose of the BAA is to develop the methods and technologies that will demonstrate, implement, and evaluate the PAINT vision.

Program Goals

The program has four goals:

1) To develop predictive models of current or emergent situations that may threaten the US.  These models should span the entire life-cycle of situations and should be inclusive of the environmental context.

2) To identify factors and strategies that may influence the evolution of these threats.

3) To develop methods for determining comprehensive indicators of these threats.

4) To use real world data and key indicators as feedback to adjust the models, their predictions, and potential influence strategies in goals 1-3.

Technical Topic Areas for the PAINT Program

To fulfill these goals, PAINT solicits white papers for research in four Topic Areas and in the interrelationships among them:

1.  Models: The approach to model development will be assessed for creativity and innovation that allows: a) rapid implementation and modification (in days), b) a comprehensive ability to describe, explain, and support predictions of specified threatening situations, c) the integration of the models into a Virtual World/Dynamic Gaming Environment, and d) model validation.

2.  Dynamic Gaming and Strategies: The proposed capability for a virtual world/dynamic gaming environment will be assessed for how well it can: a) rapidly predict a range of plausible future events and/or historical antecedents, and b) address a specified problem through the use of current data and key indicators.

3.  Key Indicators: The credibility, efficiency, and focus of the proposed process for developing key indicators from low level data will be assessed for how well it: a) uses available data as well as steers collection of new data, and b) provides feedback for tuning models and simulations, and for evaluating predictions of real world events.

4.  Architecture and Integration: The architecture needs to a) integrate the components developed in 1-3 above, b) enable the flexible and low-cost addition of new components, and c) support validation of the integrated system.

Technical Overview

This BAA proposes an overall challenge problem:  How should the Government locate and discover terrorist networks; describe them in the context of the political, religious, social and economic networks that intersect with, influence, and are influenced by, the terrorist network; explain the structure and topology of the terrorist network; predict the formation, evolution, vulnerabilities, and dissolution of the network; and identify strategies to shape or influence the network through selective action?  

The expression integrated intelligence capability enabling the policy-maker and operational user to better comprehend and to more effectively shape the future incorporates several important ideas: (1) the development of models and simulations to describe, explain, and predict situations and to serve as modular building blocks for a dynamic game/virtual world platform; (2) a dynamic game/virtual world platform where collaborative integration of data and analyses occurs across individuals, activities and agencies; (3) the use of a virtual world to identify critical factors and vulnerabilities and to develop influence strategies that affect future developments; (4) the application of current data and key indicators to evaluate the coherence and validity of the integrated picture provided by the virtual world; and (5) the capability to use this virtual world to identify "missing elements" for guiding collection.  As additional detail and information are incorporated, the parameters of the virtual world and near-term predictions can be evaluated against new data to provide a rigorous, ongoing evaluation; to update the models; and to adjust the influence strategies.  The PAINT program is focused on technologies for the rapid development of the virtual world/gaming environment and for the rapid generation and evaluation of predictions relative to the available data.  A related program, Advanced Research in Interactive Visualization for Analysis (ARIVA), will be concentrating on the user interface front end by developing new technologies for multi-modal interfaces serving multiple domains of expertise.

The PAINT program intends to leverage emerging technologies to enable the rapid creation of predictive and analytic models and simulations.  These models and simulations provide modular building blocks for a dynamic game/virtual world where the evolution of a specific network(s) can be analyzed.  Then, critical factors and vulnerabilities in alternative futures of that network can be identified to enable development of viable shaping strategies by policy-makers and operators.  The knowledge of networks provides a set of constraints or boundaries within which gaming and simulation (a common environment) can be used to extend the known into the future.  This common environment is used to integrate data, to develop predictions, and to identify critical factors and vulnerabilities which can be tested against data.  Dynamic gaming, whether competitive or cooperative, serves to introduce human judgment to account for ambiguous or poorly understood factors and to evaluate the coherence of the virtual world.  The testing process serves to validate both the predictive models and the shaping strategies.  In summary, the dynamic game/virtual world provides the basis for making predictions about the future, for developing influence strategies to affect the future, and for driving data collection to evaluate the models, predictions, and strategies.

Important Technical Ideas

The Government encourages offerors to identify their own important technical issues beyond the following list.  However, white papers should consider the following: 

1)	Integration of modeling & simulation with the emerging science of network analysis applied to distributed human groups/activities,

2)	Architectures for rapid development of simulations and models that can explain, describe, and predict situations,

3)	Development of problem-focused collaborative virtual world/dynamic game environments that can incorporate component models and simulations as well as real world data to enable the rapid exploration of strategies,

4)	Manipulation of the virtual worlds in parallel to the real world to identify critical factors, vulnerabilities and shaping strategies,

5)	Use of data filtering, data analysis, and other technologies to identify problem-specific, comprehensive collections of key indicators,

6)	Controlled application of assessment techniques to validate the outputs of the models and games against historical antecedent and actual events,

7)	Metrics and methods that tune the virtual world (and component models and simulations) against problem-specific data and feedback from near-term predictions,

8)	Systems integration issues and/or architecture concepts.

Example Variations of the Challenge Problem

The following topics represent possible expansions of the above challenge problem.  Offerors may choose to use these or others problems to explain their approach.

1. Nuclear Non-proliferation.  Terrorist networks depend on the threat of destruction and the resources to carry out those threats.  The possession of nuclear and biochemical weapon capability by unstable countries, by countries hostile to the US or by countries that are sympathetic to terrorist causes are, of course, major threats.  The technology to develop a weapon is available easily but obtaining the supplies to develop them or buying the weapons is difficult.  The problem is complicated because the US may not know whether a country: has supplies, has the capability to produce weapons, or has the presence of terrorist insiders or links to terrorist networks.  A major challenge is to describe the network of activities characteristic of nuclear energy/weapon development.  We must describe these programs in the context of the local religious, social and political networks and the multi-national political and economic situation; explain the structure of the research infrastructure for nuclear energy development using multiple indicators that distinguish offensive programs from peaceful ones; predict the evolution from what may be legal activities to weapons production; and recommend how to steer activities in peaceful directions.  Networks of indicators must be identified and interrelated to represent different stages of offensive capabilities.  This result should enable rapid creation of strategies for shaping development to blunt nuclear proliferation.

2. Denied Area Ethnography.  The challenge problem speaks of a terrorist network coexisting within and across the socio-political, economic and religious contexts of various nations.  The coexistence is at times symbiotic and on occasion parasitic.  Understanding the nature of these relationships is rooted in knowing how an organization or a country functions and the principles that guide that functionality.  Denied area ethnography is the ability to use multiple sources (news media, references, web info, info in their language, academics who have studied the area, businesses that deal with the local area and speak the language) to probe countries or regions where the US has no presence and must extract information from foreign sources.  The information must allow us to build a data-based conceptual model of that culture in terms of where people look for security; what constitutes legitimacy; and who actually controls government and commerce.  In this context, developing models of the cultural networks, deriving key cultural indicators, and creating a virtual world or dynamic game of an organization or culture provides both a method of integration and a structure for evaluating the coherence of information.

Proactive Intelligence (PAINT)

3. Globalization: Economic Warfare/Cyber Warfare.  Terrorist networks demand our attention today because of the apparent ease with which they inflict damage around the world.  The change is not so much in the network but in the technology that allows a hostile group global access.  What happens when a terrorist network acquires the capability to disrupt the vast and intersecting communications networks that allow us to function in today's electronic age?  Anyone with the right access can see worldwide economic information on his computer screen.  Similarly, a terrorist network may exploit market prices, identity theft, and redirect worldwide delivery of goods and services all by changing critical electronic information.  Warfare need not employ traditional firepower, but could be waged through information denial and disruption.  Understanding both the problem and potential solution space involves developing a robust model of each of the networks involved ? human and communications, being able to represent them in simulation/virtual environments that we can manipulate and explore for effect, and having key indicators that we can depend on for alerts about problems and what to do about them.

4. Pandemic.  Just as a terrorist network intersects with the diverse networks that constitute a nation, the contagion network, a complex structure itself, intersects with the various response networks across diverse societies.  As we watch the spread of the avian flu and its occasional penetration into humans, we recognize the need to prepare a global response to a deadly disease ? if not the avian flu, then another type of pandemic.  The required physical contact to sustain an epidemic is now extended through global transportation networks as well as the local social and familial organizations.  To impede the contagion by interrupting those networks, we would have to aid and abet the delivery of goods and services through global transportation, local social and familial networks, and collaboration with existing medical response networks.  Resolution of the problem would benefit from a) models that describe, explain and predict the intersection of diverse networks, b) simulations and virtual environments that can mimic those networks and their behavior, c) understanding of indicators for use as probes about what is happening, and d) strategies for interrupting events in ways that can halt the pandemic with minimal loss of life.

5. Emergence of Coalitions of the Intolerant.  Groups of otherwise unrelated organizations are beginning to meet and network to discuss common threats to their agendas.  For example, the anti-Davos group was formed in response to the Globalization meetings in Davos, Switzerland.  The possibility exists that a variety of organizations may pool efforts with terrorists groups to further common interests in ways that expand the reach and finances available to these ad hoc coalitions.  This topic potentially adds important elements to the above variations of the challenge problem.

Program Phases and Schedule

The PAINT program will have four phases.  Offerors should address all four phases.  Offerors should provide data for Phase 1 and plan for Government furnished data in Phases 2 through 4 (the data sets and their formats to be determined).  The general trend across all phases is (1) increasing complexity of challenge problem, (2) data that tends increasingly towards near real-time, real-world data, (3) increasing speed of development and adaptability of dynamic simulation and gaming models, and (4) increasing complex user-model interactions.  The phases and their focus areas are as follows:

Phase 1 (18 months) ? Component Predictive Models Integrated into a Virtual World/Dynamic Gaming Collaborative Environment

Phase 2 (12 months) ? Prediction Using Specific Challenge Problem with Historical or Synthetic Data

Phase 3 (12 months) ? Prediction using Real World Data Instrumentation, Feedback and Fine tuning

Phase 4 (12 months) ? Grand Challenge Problem: Influence Strategies for Alternative Futures

Scope of White Papers

Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  White papers are not limited to the specific strategies and challenge problem/applications listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, white papers should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in minor evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on special-purpose systems or narrow applications.  Teaming arrangements, if any, must be clearly defined in the white papers.  Teaming, where appropriate, is strongly encouraged in all technology areas.

V.     APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.     CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Quality of Proposed Staff and Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, and (3) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs.  Also, consideration will be given to the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA.  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.

2.     REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  DTO and the Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate have contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.  Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals.  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  

The Government may use the services of MITRE and the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) personnel in an advisory role for the technical evaluation of proposals.  The exclusive responsibility for evaluation remains with the Government.  Representatives of the foregoing firm(s) participating in the evaluation process will sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process and to protect any proprietary information within the proposals.  Any objection to the use of any or all of the personnel identified above must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI.    AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.     AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.

2.     ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award.  In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

AFRL intends to team with one or more US intelligence agencies, and may desire that offerors selected for award would perform in collaboration with those agencies.  Key Performers of prospective awardees whose activities would involve collaboration with the Intelligence Community must hold a current Top Secret Department of Defense (DoD) clearance and be approved for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.  A sufficient number of non-key performers to enable the effective accomplishment of the proposed research effort must also hold a Top Secret DoD clearance with SCI access, or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.  In addition, prospective awardees whose activities would be associated with the Intelligence Community must also possess a current DoD Top Secret Facility clearance and an approved SCI Facility (SCIF).  Offerors desiring consideration for awards involving collaboration with the Intelligence Community shall identify key personnel and enabling support staff satisfying the above Top Secret DoD clearance and SCI access requirement; shall certify their DoD Top Secret Facility clearance; and, shall detail their organization's approach to maintaining separation of unclassified and classified activities, and controlling need-to-know.

It should be noted that PAINT is not intended as a solely classified effort, and that there is a wide range of research that can be done at an unclassified level.  Offerors should make it clear in their white papers and proposals which aspects of their work, if any, will be at the classified level.  While it is possible to execute an entire research program on the unclassified level, having key personnel with Top Secret DoD clearance will enable the program to have greater access to the real needs of analysts, thereby increasing the chances of successful research.  For the Architecture and Integration, and Key Indicators categories Top Secret Clearances for key personnel are preferred.

3.     REPORTING: For proposals selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through our web-based reporting system known as JIFFY.  Prior to award the offeror will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Sensors as Robots represents the next evolutionary step in sensor development.  The program proposes an autonomous constellation of autonomous sensors utilizing advanced knowledge-based algorithms that leverage knowledge of the environment, targets and past experiences to provide performance gains of orders of magnitude in interference rejection, target detection, identification and tracking.  Unlike existing fielded monolithic systems, Sensors as Robots strives to produce sensors that augment existing capabilities by optimally utilizing all available resources in a pervasive and anticipatory manner.  It is also envisioned that this technology will facilitate sensing missions that humans are not capable of or available to conduct.  In addition, further goals extend to the development of concepts and technology for future weapons systems that eliminate the possibility of involuntarily placing the warfighter and supporting staff in harms way.

Achieving such a lofty goal requires development of new technology and future roadmaps for that which cannot be developed in the initial phase of this program. Technology development must focus on the following five areas, in ascending order of importance; net-centric sensing for Net-Centric Warfare/layered sensing/distributed sensing, proportional engagement and predictive resource allocation. Due to the broad scope of this program, white papers should strive to minimize duplication of efforts within the Department of Defense.  Therefore, it is imperative that all parties submitting white papers be aware of existing and emerging capabilities. Those of relevance should be leveraged in submitted white papers to reduce development time of the final product. 

The U.S. Air Force has set an ambitious goal to be able to anticipate, find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess ? anything, anytime, anywhere.  Achieving a multi-faceted goal of this nature requires a solution not limited by traditional approaches, since   conventional radar and other sensors are not sufficient.  The current norm advocates larger more powerful antennas, utilizing existing detection processing and power-aperture products.  Instead, what is needed, is a distributed network of heterogeneous sensors (RF, EO/IR and acoustic transducers) utilizing advanced signal processing techniques and system concepts.  Through this manner, we can achieve order of magnitude performance gains over existing and planned systems. 

Waveform diversity is currently perceived to be the current state of the art in radar technology.  Recent research incorporates adaptivity into the transmitted waveform for multi-mission multi-mode simultaneous SAR and GMTI, integrated sensing and communication. Focus on the joint design of antenna and waveform systems by the Air Force for integrated sensing has led to distributed apertures being considered as a generalization of classically designed multi-static radar system concepts.  This abstraction resulted in fine angular resolution aspects of distributed apertures being investigated, with orthogonal waveforms and frequency diversity applied for the suppression of grating lobes.  Such systems are being proposed for precision engagement, as well as for ground moving target indication and identification applications.  At the same time, others are extending traditional multiple-input multiple-output techniques with frequency diversity for radar applications. And by exploiting spatial diversity in lieu of bandwidth, radio frequency tomography is demonstrating improved resolution using a variety of waveforms, including multi-band and ultra-narrow band signals.  A unified approach of waveform design combined with spatial diversity is also advancing the state-of-the-art.  No longer are the signals radiated from each element assumed to be identical within a phase shift, and this lead to new capabilities.  One of such is frequency diverse arrays, which have the potential to generate beam patterns that vary direction of focus with range.

A new capability that is of particular interest is simultaneous multi-mission multi-mode operation.  Multi-mode radars have existed for many years, but these systems typically employ sequential or interleaved modes of operation, often changed on a mission to mission basis rather than a true simultaneous capability.  This can create problems when, for example, a ground moving target indication system is tracking a target which stops moving.  Unless other (imaging) sensors are within the region of interest, the target may be lost.  This traditional approach clearly does not lend itself to the ambitious goal to find, fix, and track ? anything, anytime, anywhere.  If we are going to adhere to this goal, then our distributed/layered sensors need to be able to go anywhere at anytime.  In addition, they must be able to function autonomously or as a seamlessly integrated system capable of conducting intelligent surveillance and reconnaissance to support military efforts against new threats.  Through Sensors as Robots technology, the Air Force will be able to automatically predict the optimum positioning of sensors (air, ground and space) at the right times to facilitate these needs.  Therefore, Sensors as Robots is seen as the next logical step in the development of Net Centric Sensors for Net Centric Warfare.  It is also considered to be essential for successful development of distributed and layered sensors that are complementary to the AF triad (AWACS, JSTARS and River Joints).  Such platform's onboard sensors stand to gain optimized flight profiles through unobtrusive network interaction.  Sensing modalities (especially waveforms), inter/intra-platform sharing of signals and data, communications and electronic warfare are in a position to reap the benefits of leveraging this technology's infrastructure.  These gains do not even take into account the flexibility provided from the logical extension of existing and future assets that will become available.  Additional applications and further musings may be found in the motivational discussion in reference [1].

AFRL/SN seeks detailed concepts and plans for the realization of Sensors as Robots as a future technology foundational to next generation systems.  Experimental demonstration of all critical aspects of this technology, especially signal, image and data processing algorithms are essential.  Systems of systems level simulation analysis demonstrating performance metrics and improvements over existing approaches are also required.  Innovation is a trademark of AFRL; hence all submissions should strive to emphasize novel ideas to distinguish themselves.

White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

At this time all of the work that will be conducted under this BAA will be unclassified.  But depending on the work proposed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data. Offerors submitting white papers are required to submit a statement stating that they can meet the above requirements. 

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:

<DESC>This is a notice of intent by the Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronic Program Office (PMA-209) to issue an order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-05-G-0024 with Rockwell Collins Government Systems (RCGS), 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, IA  52498.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is assigned responsibility for the planning, programming, budgeting, procurement, installation, operation, and support of the Air Combat Electronics programs.  This effort covers the requirements to provide the A-10 a robust Line-of-Sight (LOS) secure communications system to fully integrate with composite combat forces.  An ability to reprogram voice communications in flight provides reliable means of disseminating real-time updates with isolated forces and Command and Control (C2) assets.  Current operations in mountainous and other inhospitable environments are under increasing risk of compromise requiring reduced response times during unconventional air support missions, reduced logistical challenges with sustainment of current equipment and improved interoperable connectivity with communications equipment fielded and used by forces being employed both on the ground and airborne.  The net effect of a secure robust LOS communications capability will be a highly reliable, responsive Close Air Support and Combat Search and Rescue, with lower maintenance enjoyed by materiel improvement.  This effort defines the replacement of the current AN/ARC-186 VHF AM radio with a dual band UHF/VHF radio for a secure LOS capability.  The contractor shall design, fabricate, and deliver a Group A Installation Kit (i.e., unique mounts and any intrinsic wiring/brackets) that are necessary for the installation of a Line-of-Sight (LOS) communications capability.  The Group A and B Kits shall include specialized adapter cables to mate with the existing wiring connectors and the Group B Kit Items (LRU?s).  The contractor shall design the Group A and B Kits such that modification/de-modification time shall be minimized and installation performed by organic field maintenance personnel.  This requirements is for 12 ?A? Kits and 12 each RCU Cable Assemblies, RT Mount Assemblies, and Antenna Kits for incorporation into ?B? Kits.  As Rockwell Collins is the sole developer of the ARC-210 Family of products and related ancillary equipment and maintain the proprietary rights to this radio, they are the only capable source of providing the requested changes.  Effort will be performed within 4 months ARO.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.

The vendor is the only responsible sole source for maintenance support, upgrades, update and fixes; no other source can maintain the software or provide the relevant software upgrades. 
<P>
The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed purchase order for the maintenance and software license upgrades. Other organizations possessing the requisite expertise and resources are invited to submit information concerning their capabilities, expertise, and other pertinent data. Pricing data may be submitted. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. This is not a request for quotation and the Government does not intend to pay for information received.

Responses to this notice should be submitted by Noon on February 27th, 2006. Request for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. Oral communications are not acceptable.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs is seeking contractor support to accomplish the deliverables described in the statement of work (SOW), except as may otherwise be specified.  The primary effort will be to provide maintenance support for all relevant components of the DVA Insurance Service's Production and Test Document Imaging Systems, which consists of the hardware and software necessary for scanning, indexing, storing, and retrieving documents.  These services will include all necessary parts, labor and unlimited emergency calls during normal working hours.  It will also include installing new versions of imaging software, patches, and fixes.  The contractor shall be located within a 60 mile radius of our office in Philadelphia, Pa.  The contractor shall provide telephone and on-site support within two business hour telephone response time and four business hour on site response. 	The DVA Insurance Service, located in Philadelphia, has been imaging documents related to the management of VA's administered government life insurance programs since 1998.  Currently, there are over 8.5 million documents stored on this system.  On our current system document storage and retrieval is accomplished using Stellent's IBPM software v7.5. Most of the documents are captured for storage to this system via document scanning.  The front end capture process uses Captovation's eCapture software v4.3.  Certain documents from our mainframe are also stored and retrieved on this system.  These documents are internally captured via a process created by the DVA Insurance Service, in conjunction with the Stellent SDK product.  This process transfers a flat file from our mainframe to a text file on our server.  It then creates a Microsoft Word document from the text file, and stores it as a universal document in our imaging system. The images themselves are retrieved via the VA's custom user interface (front-end) software know as VICTARS, which is a Visual Basic application.  This interface also makes use of the SDK product.  The period of performance is from date of award through September 30, 2007, plus four (2) one-year option periods.  Work at the government site shall not take place on federal holidays or weekends unless directed by the Contacting Officer (CO).  Proposal due date is November 27, 2006.   Work performed under this contract shall take place at The Department of Veteran Affairs Regional Office and Insurance Center, (ROIC), 5000 Wissahickon Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19144

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This procurement will eliminate unacceptable delays and enable the depot to meet the funded FY 07 requirements, thus enhancin g the national military defense readiness posture and increase support to the soldier.

<DESC>YELLOWSTONE and GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK MULTIPLE AWARD TASK ORDER CONTRACT (MATOC)

THIS MODIFICATION IS ISSED TO UPDATE THE SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD FROM $28.5 MILLION TO $31 MILLION AND TO UPDATE THE AGGREGATE BONDING LIMITS FROM $30 MILLION TO $50 MILLION AS INDICATED BELOW.  All other stipulations of the synopsis remain the same.

THIS SOLICITATION IS OFFERED FOR FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS.  This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent of awarding at least three (3) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) for Road/Bridge/Highway construction and related services for Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, Wyoming (assuming receipt of 3 or more acceptable offerors).  The IDIQ contracts will have a base period of one year and have four one-year options periods for a potential length of 5 years.  All work will be ordered by task order.  
The task orders for the anticipated contracts will be firm fixed price and work performed will be primarily construction of roads, bridges, and retaining wall projects under the NAICS code 237310, Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction (small business size standard of:   $31 MILLION ? updated from $28.5 million).

Individual task orders will be competed among all awardees and will vary in anticipated size ranging from $25,000.00 to $25,000,000.00.  Total dollar value of all task orders placed on all contracts awarded will not exceed the total program value of $127 Million.  Western Federal Lands (WFL) intends to issue all documents to include the initial solicitation, amendments, clarification letters, and other applicable documents electronically.  Only project plan sheets and physical data will be available in hard copy.  The contractor may be required under a Design - Build task order, to provide design, working drawings, construction, and on-site design support.

As an element of the evaluation, all offerors must provide proof of their bonding capacity.  Bonding limits are as follows:  
Single project $25 Million and aggregate $50 MILLION (updated from $30 million).  The guaranteed minimum for the life of each contract is $25,000.00, which may be met by award of a task order.  All contracts will remain active:  (1) until contract expiration, (2) until task order completion, or (3) until the contractual maximum funding limit is reached.

Awards will be made using Best Value source selection procedures.  The Government will award the contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request For Proposal (RFP) will be the Best Value to the Government.  Best Value will be determined using a trade-off process, comparing price, technical, and other factors.  It is the Governments intent to award based on initial offers received, without discussions.  The award may be made to a superior offeror which is not the lowest offered price, but which is significantly more technically advantageous than the lowest offer so as to justify the payment of a higher price.  The evaluation factors and selection process will be issued prior to the solicitation to allow potential offerors ample time for preparation.  Offerors will be required to submit technical and cost/price proposals for the first project(s)/task order(s), which will be included in the RFP.  Once the contracts are awarded, the Government will compete the work among the awardees based on performance and other factors set forth in the contract and Task Order RFP.  Selected firms will be expected to work closely with WFL and Park personnel.  Each awardee will be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for subsequent task orders, except under those circumstances described in FAR 16.505(b)(2) which states:

(2) Exceptions to the fair opportunity process. The contracting officer shall give every awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for a delivery-order or task-order exceeding $2,500 unless one of the following statutory exceptions applies:

(i) The agency need for the supplies or services is so urgent that providing a fair opportunity would result in unacceptable delays;

(ii) Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized;

(iii) The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.

(iv) It is necessary to place an order to satisfy a minimum guarantee.

It is the contractors responsibility to monitor the web page for any amendments to this solicitation.   All contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award.  Registration information for CCR may be obtained by phoning 1-888-227-2423 or by accessing the Internet website at http://www.ccr.gov.   Bonding and Insurance will be required for Construction project task orders.  Liquidated damages and Davis Bacon Rates will be specified in individual task orders.  This procurement is advertised as a full and open competition.

The REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (specifications) and OFFERORS PACKET will be available in electronic format only.  Plans will be available in paper format.

Section K?(ORCA) On Line Representations and Certifications - Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companies ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.   The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.Thank you, Teresa Sorrenti IAE Program Manager Integrated Acquisition Environment 2011 Crystal Drive,  Crystal Park 1, Suite 911, Arlington, VA 22202 ,  Tel. 703-872-8600  Fax 703-872-8598,email integrated.acquisition@gsa.gov | http:egov.gsa.gov.  All Offerors must acknowledgment all amendments if any.  Offers received after the exact time and date specified will not be considered.  The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the government.

<DESC>This is a revised Request for Information (RFI) originally issued by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) on October 10, 2006.  The purpose of the RFI is to solicit information from industry for development and/or integration of proven technologies supporting Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).  The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard have defined MDA to be (quote). . . the effective understanding of anything associated with the global maritime environment that could impact the security, safety, economy or environment of the United States.(end quote)   The objective of MDA is to generate actionable intelligence for exchange within a global enterprise of analysts as well as front-line military and law enforcement professionals.  To support the MDA effort, methods and techniques are required for effective collection, assimilation and dissemination of enormous quantities of data and information drawn from U.S. joint forces, U.S. government agencies, international coalition partners and forces, and commercial entities.  Information derived from these various sources is to be integrated to enrich a comprehensive Common Operating Picture (COP) envisioned to be distributed widely among users with access to data that is classified appropriately.  The primary goal is achieve synergies from the fusion of information to provide a comprehensive situational awareness picture, while being responsive to the information needs of participating agencies.

NRL has multiple ongoing MDA programs.  One ongoing program is the Comprehensive Maritime Awareness Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (CMA JCTD) is intended to demonstrate the value of interagency and international information exchange through the use of effective data management strategies and automated tools in order to improve MDA.  The goal of CMA is to address serious gaps in our ability to identify and prioritize maritime threats, enabling the proper focus of limited maritime security resources.   CMA objectives include (1) Rapidly assemble a comprehensive maritime picture from multiple sources using automated fusion tools, anomaly detection capabilities, collaborative toolsets, and other net-centric data management strategies, (2) Create a maritime picture that can be shared with international and interagency partners at multiple levels of security, in multiple domains, and across a wide range of operations and scenarios that simultaneously supports both bilateral and multilateral relationships, and (3) Enhance maritime awareness, facilitate operational decision making, and increase opportunities for international and interagency maritime security cooperation.  

A recently selected NRL three-year effort is referred to as Maritime Automatic Super Track Enhanced Reporting (MASTER).  MASTER objectives include (1) Aggregating data from multiple sources useful in determining ship movement, current location, and intentions, (2) Further automating the generation and maintenance of tracks of ships of all sizes on a global basis, (3) Associating/linking relevant metadata to ship tracks that assist front-line personnel and analysts in determining track history, current behavior, status, and other pertinent information, (4) Generating and attaching notification, alert, and warning metadata to ship tracks that can be used to flag vessels of interest accurately, and (5) Reporting tracks and metadata to front-line military or law enforcement personnel and analysts at different security levels.  The anticipated capability enhancements will be: (1) Greatly improved maritime situational awareness, (2) Automatic maintenance of a large number of ship tracks per day, (3) A service-oriented architecture (SOA).

Specifically, this RFI seeks information on non-proprietary MDA efforts and technology under contract to a United States Government or foreign government agency.  Such efforts completed and demonstrated within the last year are also of interest as well as commercial offerings (e.g., of vessel metadata).  Data sources, successes, and innovations in the following areas are of particular interest: (1) Sensor data from governmental systems and shore-based facilities that provide vessel identification or vessel location, (2) Tracking/correlation/fusion algorithms for different operating areas (open ocean, littorals, straights, and ports), (3) Multi-source vessel metadata, (4) Detection methods and alerting criteria for ship behavior or metadata deviating from historical norms, published plans, or predictions, and (5) Accredited mechanisms to exchange information in real time between systems and applications at different security levels.

Vendors interested in responding to this RFI may submit information by mail or email in English no later than November 1, 2006.  Information may be submitted to: Naval Research Laboratory, 4555 Overlook, Ave. S.W., ATTN: Mr. Louis Chmura, Code 8145, 4555 Overlook Avenue, Washington, D.C. 20375, or to email address: nrlmda@kingcrab.nrl.navy.mil.  Submissions should include the following information: (a) Name of current or recent contract effort, (b) Government contract number, (c) Government Program Manager contact information, (d) Vendor Point of Contact, and (e) Summary of effort (two-page maximum per effort).  Submissions at higher classification levels can be arranged upon request.  Submission of a response to this RFI is voluntary.  The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the NRL to pay or entitle the submitter.  NRL may contact selected vendors for subsequent technical discussions.  Responses received after November 1, 2006 will not be reviewed.

<DESC>This announcement amends NRL-Wide BAA 05-01 posted on December 30, 2004 by revising topic BAA 82-05-01 SPACECRAFT TECHNOLOGY- Next Generation Control Moment Gyros (CMGs) Program.  Revisions to this topic under this Modification include changes to the desirable features and design considerations for this program topic. This program is structured to demonstrate the viability of a Next Generation CMG via a program of targeted risk reduction testing and analysis which culminates with the build and test of a technology demonstration unit Next Generation CMG.   The program hopes to enable the insertion of these Next Generation CMG designs into future spacecraft by taking the level of development to the point that the basic design & lessons learned could be leveraged for a formal flight qualification program by a prime contractor for new or existing programs while not subjecting those programs to prohibitive cost, technical and schedule risk..  The Next Generation CMG would have the same general Black Box performance of existing CMG?s but with the additional goals of:  a) greater than or equal to 50% less equivalent mass (1st priority); b) 50% less volume (2nd priority);  c) Induced Vibration (IV) less than existing levels (3rd priority);  and d) Power: Included In  Equivalent Mass (0.3 kg/Watt Quiescent Power).  Detailed information on this topic, as well as the complete BAA including initial proposal and formal proposal preparation instructions, technical points of contact for each topic, and evaluation criteria, is available at http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/baa.htm

BROOKS CITY-BASE TEXAS
Air Force Chemical Sample Analyses

SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS)
FA8900-06-R-9002
24 April 2006

Headquarters Air Force Material Command, Aeronautical Systems Center, 311 Human Systems Wing, Air Force Institute for Occupational Health at Brooks City Base, San Antonio TX is conducting market research for information in developing a preliminary acquisition strategy for Air Force Chemical Sample Analyses requirements.  This synopsis is for market research only.  It is not a: Solicitation or a commitment by AFIOH to contract for services identified herein.  The Government will not pay respondents for information in response to this market research.  This SSS and the information collected will not restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.   

1.  PURPOSE/GENERAL INFORMATION:  AFIOH is considering awarding a firm-fixed Price (FFP) Blanket Purchase Agreement(s) (BPA) or an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) for chemistry and occupational health services in support of operational requirements at various Air Force installations (See attachment 3).  The Government is interested in identifying firms who possess the capability and experience to provide laboratory support services for Chemical analysis of environmental and occupational samples. The current projected rough order of magnitude (ROM) for all bases is $8 to $9 Million over a five year period of performance.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code for this effort is “541380”.  Interested sources should provide a capabilities package per the instructions below.  

2. BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The objective of this market research is to identify sources who are capable of, or capable of teaming with other firms to provide a full spectrum of laboratory support services to include: sample transportation, receiving, storage, analysis, chain-of-custody, analytical reporting, and disposal of the following types of samples: organic, inorganic, conventional, and general chemical.  Samples may also include mixed wastes (waste that is composed of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous constituents).   Samples originate from but are not limited to: groundwater, surface water, waste streams, soil, sediment, solids, fuel, oil, and coal ash/sludge. Any future contract vehicle will require the contractor to meet all applicable federal, state, local laws and regulations.  Specific details regarding sampling requirements are contained in the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (See attachment 1).  The sample analyses and historical estimates of analytical requests per region are contained in attachment 2. 

3.  PRELIMINARY ACQUISITION STRATEGIES.   Industry comments are encouraged and welcomed. The Government would like to award any future requirement to a single company or teaming arrangement of companies.  However we are not aware of any one company or teaming arrangement that is positioned to meet all of our future requirements.  Therefore, we are currently contemplating three acquisition strategies.  The first possible strategy is to provide all GSA schedule 66 III holders a fair opportunity for Blanket Purchase Agreement(s).  A second contemplated strategy is a competitive commercial BPA, or lastly a Full and Open Competition resulting in multiple award IDIQ contract(s).  In either case the Government is contemplating a best value source selection based on the following criteria:

1. Mission Capability 

a. Technical Capability - Laboratories shall be accredited for each applicable test sample method by a nationally recognized laboratory accreditation body, e.g.; the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Conference (NELAC), compliant with ISO/IEC 17011:2004.  All laboratories must demonstrate the capability to generate acceptable results from the analysis of proficiency-testing (PT) samples, using ea  

 s periodically.  Thank you for your interest.

<DESC>AIR FORCE INSTITUTE FOR OPERATIONAL HEALTH (AFIOH) 
BROOKS CITY-BASE TEXAS
Air Force Chemical Sample Analyses

SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS)
FA8900-06-R-9002
24 April 2006

Headquarters Air Force Material Command, Aeronautical Systems Center, 311 Human Systems Wing, Air Force Institute for Occupational Health at Brooks City Base, San Antonio TX is conducting market research for information in developing a preliminary acquisition strategy for Air Force Chemical Sample Analyses requirements.  This synopsis is for market research only.  It is not a: Solicitation or a commitment by AFIOH to contract for services identified herein.  The Government will not pay respondents for information in response to this market research.  This SSS and the information collected will not restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.   

1.  PURPOSE/GENERAL INFORMATION:  AFIOH is considering awarding a firm-fixed Price (FFP) Blanket Purchase Agreement(s) (BPA) or an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) for chemistry and occupational health services in support of operational requirements at various Air Force installations (See attachment 3).  The Government is interested in identifying firms who possess the capability and experience to provide laboratory support services for Chemical analysis of environmental and occupational samples. The current projected rough order of magnitude (ROM) for all bases is $8 to $9 Million over a five year period of performance.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code for this effort is “541380”.  Interested sources should provide a capabilities package per the instructions below.  

2. BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The objective of this market research is to identify sources who are capable of, or capable of teaming with other firms to provide a full spectrum of laboratory support services to include: sample transportation, receiving, storage, analysis, chain-of-custody, analytical reporting, and disposal of the following types of samples: organic, inorganic, conventional, and general chemical.  Samples may also include mixed wastes (waste that is composed of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous constituents).   Samples originate from but are not limited to: groundwater, surface water, waste streams, soil, sediment, solids, fuel, oil, and coal ash/sludge. Any future contract vehicle will require the contractor to meet all applicable federal, state, local laws and regulations.  Specific details regarding sampling requirements are contained in the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (See attachment 1).  The sample analyses and historical estimates of analytical requests per region are contained in attachment 2. 

3.  PRELIMINARY ACQUISITION STRATEGIES.   Industry comments are encouraged and welcomed. The Government would like to award any future requirement to a single company or teaming arrangement of companies.  However we are not aware of any one company or teaming arrangement that is positioned to meet all of our future requirements.  Therefore, we are currently contemplating three acquisition strategies.  The first possible strategy is to provide all GSA schedule 66 III holders a fair opportunity for Blanket Purchase Agreement(s).  A second contemplated strategy is a competitive commercial BPA, or lastly a Full and Open Competition resulting in multiple award IDIQ contract(s).  In either case the Government is contemplating a best value source selection based on the following criteria:

1. Mission Capability 

a. Technical Capability - Laboratories shall be accredited for each applicable test sample method by a nationally recognized laboratory accreditation body, e.g.; the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Conference (NELAC), compliant with ISO/IEC 17011:2004.  All laboratories must demonstrate the capability to generate acceptable results from the analysis of proficiency-testing (PT) samples, using each applicable method in a specified matrix.  Those laboratories who describe their procedures in maintaining operational capabilities necessary to perform environmental compliance analyses and who also at a minimum provide certification.  Certification requirements at a minimum consist of the labs being either NELAC or EPA certified with all applicable State and Local regulatory agencies.  Potential agencies will receive favorable evaluation credits for meeting the minimum requirements plus any additional certifications provided.  Laboratories that also provide examples of sample test code and function data documentation and examples of their proficiency in the development of functional electronic data documents will be given more favorable evaluation credit.  
b.	Management Approach - Laboratories must conduct and document an internal 
Quality Control (QC) program for all laboratory work performed pursuant to the guidelines established by the EPA, the DoD QSM and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).  Interested parties and their teammates or subcontractors, should meet or exceed minimum Quality System Performance standards for Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisitions Involving Environmental Sampling or Testing Services, as any resulting solicitation and contract vehicle will include this requirement.  The DoD Quality Systems Manual (QSM) for Environmental Laboratories provides implementation guidance on the establishment and management of quality systems for environmental testing laboratories that intend to perform work for DoD.  This guide is based on the NELAC Quality System requirements, which is consistent with ISO/IEC 17025: 1999, provides implementation clarification and expectations for DoD environmental programs.   Laboratories must provide an established laboratory quality system that complies with ISO/IEC 17025:19999.  The laboratory must also maintain certification conformance to the DoD QSM.  Laboratories that provide documentation that their QC systems and procedures have been assessed as operational and in conformance with the above listed programs will receive favorable evaluation credit.   
 	2.  Proposal Risk.  Proposal risk evaluation focuses on the weaknesses associated with an offeror's proposed approach. Assessment of proposal risk considers potential for disruption of schedule, increased cost, poor performance, the need for increased government oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance

Performance assessments will be used as a resource in awarding best value contracts and orders to contractors that consistently provide quality, on-time products and services that conform to contractual requirements.

<CONTACT>Steve Bense Contract Specialist 708-786-5175
<DESC>This is a correction to a previously published sources sought announcement, changing the final date for response.  Interested vendors should contact the contracting officer, via email (steve.bense@va.gov), as part of this market research.  No collect calls. The VA National Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) program is intending to replace its current direct-to-patient distribution contract. The basic operation of the current contract is synopsized as follows:  - Automated transmissions, to the contractor, of prescriptions from each CMOP facility.  - Contractor maintains sufficient on-hand stock for real-time fulfillment of prescriptions within a minimum time period.  - Contractor expeditiously ships the prescriptions direct to the patient within a minimum time period.  - Contractor timely invoices each CMOP for prescription fulfillment. In general, the prescribed products being delivered direct to the patient consist of approximately 1,000 different types of medical / surgical (MED/SURG) items (e.g.: syringes, adult diapers, dressing kits, etc.) and some over-the-counter (OTC) products (e.g.: dietary supplements, etc.).  The prescriptions being delivered will be shipped direct to veteran patients who are located in any part of the United States or its territories, and will vary in product size. This is a sources sought announcement.  This is not an announcement of a solicitation, nor is it a request for proposals or quotations.  Please monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website for any further information related to this topic.

This address accepts USPS and Express Mail deliveries. This requirement will require a firm that has the ability to capably manage an effort that wiil produce 20 (Twenty) Individual Programmatic Environmental Assessments in 20 States. This effort may require extensive subcontractor effort and presence in those 20 States. Companies that are capable and interested should forward capability statements, and experiences in managing an effort of this scope and complexity, and be capable of delivering high quality technical products. Companies that are experienced in delivering this service may share with USDA its experiences, problems encountered and any suggestions that may aid USDA in acquiring these services.

Conservation Reserve Program
Twenty Individual Programmatic Environmental Assessments

1.  INTRODUCTION

The Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, authorized the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).  The program is governed by regulations published in 7 CFR, part 1410.  The program is implemented by FSA on behalf of the United States Department of Agriculture?s Commodity Credit Corporation.

CRP is the largest voluntary conservation program operated by the Federal government and has implemented conservation practices on over 36 million acres of private land.   CRP has evolved from its early roots as primarily an erosion control initiative to an environmental program that addresses diverse local and national natural resource priorities.  The program offers participants annual rental payments for 10 to 15 years and cost share assistance to eligible producers who establish long-term, resource-conserving covers on eligible land to reduce soil erosion, improve water quality, and enhance wildlife habitat.  FSA bases rental rates on the relative productivity of the soils within each county and the average cash rent or cash rent equivalent.

Haying and Grazing 
Haying and grazing of CRP acreage is authorized under certain conditions to improve the quality and performance of the CRP cover or to provide emergency relief to livestock producers due to certain natural disasters. There are two types of haying and grazing authorization: managed and emergency.
 
Primary Nesting Season 
Generally, CRP acreage may not be hayed or grazed during the Primary Nesting Season for certain wildlife established by state FSA committees in consultation with USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) State Technical Committee.
 
Managed Haying and Grazing 
Managed haying and grazing is authorized no more frequently than one out of every three years after the CRP cover is fully established. Managed haying and grazing may be available less frequently in a particular area depending upon local conditions, resource capacity, and the conservation goals of the program. Also, acreage either hayed or grazed under managed or emergency provisions in either of the previous two years is ineligible for managed haying or grazing in the current year.

Managed haying is authorized for a single period up to 90 days. Managed grazing is authorized for a single period up to 120 days or for two 60-day periods. CRP participants requesting managed haying and grazing must file a request with their local FSA office indicating the acreage to be hayed or grazed before the activity begins. Additionally, CRP participants requesting managed haying and grazing are assessed a 25 percent payment reduction except when managed haying and grazing is conducted in an "emergency" area.


2.  OBJECTIVE

The Agency seeks the services of an experienced contractor to coordinate all relevant environmental planning, studies, and documentation services, including public involvement and coordination support, for the preparation of 20 individual Programmatic Environmental Assessments (PEA) for the following States:

Arizona	New York
California	North Dakota
Colorado	Oklahoma
Idaho	Oregon
Indiana	South Dakota
Kansas	Texas
Montana	Utah
Nebraska	Washington
Nevada	Wisconsin
New Mexico	Wyoming

Due to the size and complexity of the tasks related to this contract, it is envisioned that the Contractor shall serve as a Prime Contractor working with other consulting firms and utilizing subcontractors in each of the 20 States to furfill the requirements of this project. It is highly recommended that qualified state environmental consulting firms, familiar with state agricultural and wildlife issues, be used in completion of these PEAs.

The State-level PEAs shall specifically focus on the potential effects of allowing managed haying and grazing on land enrolled in CRP and the potential impacts on ground nesting birds and other wildlife.  The primary focus of these PEAs shall be but are not limited to:
?	Establishment of beginning and ending dates for primary nesting seasons;

BROOKS CITY-BASE TEXAS
Air Force Chemical Sample Analyses

SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS)
FA8900-06-R-9002
24 April 2006

Headquarters Air Force Material Command, Aeronautical Systems Center, 311 Human Systems Wing, Air Force Institute for Occupational Health at Brooks City Base, San Antonio TX is conducting market research for information in developing a preliminary acquisition strategy for Air Force Chemical Sample Analyses requirements.  This synopsis is for market research only.  It is not a: Solicitation or a commitment by AFIOH to contract for services identified herein.  The Government will not pay respondents for information in response to this market research.  This SSS and the information collected will not restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.   

1.  PURPOSE/GENERAL INFORMATION:  AFIOH is considering awarding a firm-fixed Price (FFP) Blanket Purchase Agreement(s) (BPA) or an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) for chemistry and occupational health services in support of operational requirements at various Air Force installations (See attachment 3).  The Government is interested in identifying firms who possess the capability and experience to provide laboratory support services for Chemical analysis of environmental and occupational samples. The current projected rough order of magnitude (ROM) for all bases is $8 to $9 Million over a five year period of performance.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code for this effort is “541380”.  Interested sources should provide a capabilities package per the instructions below.  

2. BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The objective of this market research is to identify sources who are capable of, or capable of teaming with other firms to provide a full spectrum of laboratory support services to include: sample transportation, receiving, storage, analysis, chain-of-custody, analytical reporting, and disposal of the following types of samples: organic, inorganic, conventional, and general chemical.  Samples may also include mixed wastes (waste that is composed of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous constituents).   Samples originate from but are not limited to: groundwater, surface water, waste streams, soil, sediment, solids, fuel, oil, and coal ash/sludge. Any future contract vehicle will require the contractor to meet all applicable federal, state, local laws and regulations.  Specific details regarding sampling requirements are contained in the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (See attachment 1).  The sample analyses and historical estimates of analytical requests per region are contained in attachment 2. 

3.  PRELIMINARY ACQUISITION STRATEGIES.   Industry comments are encouraged and welcomed. The Government would like to award any future requirement to a single company or teaming arrangement of companies.  However we are not aware of any one company or teaming arrangement that is positioned to meet all of our future requirements.  Therefore, we are currently contemplating three acquisition strategies.  The first possible strategy is to provide all GSA schedule 66 III holders a fair opportunity for Blanket Purchase Agreement(s).  A second contemplated strategy is a competitive commercial BPA, or lastly a Full and Open Competition resulting in multiple award IDIQ contract(s).  In either case the Government is contemplating a best value source selection based on the following criteria:

1. Mission Capability 

a. Technical Capability - Laboratories shall be accredited for each applicable test sample method by a nationally recognized laboratory accreditation body, e.g.; the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Conference (NELAC), compliant with ISO/IEC 17011:2004.  All laboratories must demonstrate the capability to generate acceptable results from the analysis of proficiency-testing (PT) samples, using each applicable method in a specified matrix.  Those laboratories who describe their procedures in maintaining operational capabilities necessary to perform environmental compliance analyses and who also at a minimum provide certification.  Certification requirements at a minimum consist of the labs being either NELAC or EPA certified with all applicable State and Local regulatory agencies.  Potential agencies will receive favorable evaluation credits for meeting the minimum requirements plus any additional certifications provided.  Laboratories that also provide examples of sample test code and function data documentation and examples of their proficiency in the development of functional electronic data documents will be given more favorable evaluation credit.  
b.	Management Approach - Laboratories must conduct and document an internal 
Quality Control (QC) program for all laboratory work performed pursuant to the guidelines established by the EPA, the DoD QSM and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).  Interested parties and their teammates or subcontractors, should meet or exceed minimum Quality System Performance standards for Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisitions Involving Environmental Sampling or Testing Services, as any resulting solicitation and contract vehicle will include this requirement.  The DoD Quality Systems Manual (QSM) for Environmental Laboratories provides implementation guidance on the establishment and management of quality systems for environmental testing laboratories that intend to perform work for DoD.  This guide is based on the NELAC Quality System requirements, which is consistent with ISO/IEC 17025: 1999, provides implementation clarification and expectations for DoD environmental programs.   Laboratories must provide an established laboratory quality system that complies with ISO/IEC 17025:19999.  The laboratory must also maintain certification conformance to the DoD QSM.  Laboratories that provide documentation that their QC systems and procedures have been assessed as operational and in conformance with the above listed programs will receive favorable evaluation credit.   
 	2.  Proposal Risk.  Proposal risk evaluation focuses on the weaknesses associated with an offeror's proposed approach. Assessment of proposal risk considers potential for disruption of schedule, increased cost, poor performance, the need for increased government oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance

3.  Past Performance -  The primary purpose of this performance review is to ensure that accurate data on contractor performance is current and available for use in source selections through the Past Performance Informational Retrieval System (PPIRS). Performance assessments will be used as a resource in awarding best value contracts and orders to contractors that consistently provide quality, on-time products and services that conform to contractual requirements. This information can be used to effectively communicate contractor strengths and weaknesses to source selection officials. 
  
4.  Price - The Government will use Best Value in the evaluation of price.

4.  NARRATIVE SUMMARIES BY REGION OF INSTALLATIONS. 
Testing requirements for each base will vary.  The last 2.5 years of historical requirement quantities for each base is listed in attachment 2.  There is a high degree of geographical diversity associated with this work.  The installations reside within the continental United States, therefore, the contractor will need to be familiar with the differing state regulations and be certified by the state where the installation is located.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is seeking to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification, (Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), HUBZone, 8(a), small, small disadvantaged, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business) relative to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 541710, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (size standard of 1,000 employees) in support of the Targets and Countermeasures Directorate (MDA/DET) Low Cost Assessment Target (LCAT) Program.  The original synopsis, DET-06-001, was issued with the understanding the Government would provide facilities for the effort.  Because the Government has learned that they may not be able to provide those facilities, this synopsis is being reissued to broaden the market research to find possible sources that can provide those facilities until such time that the activities can be transitioned to Government provided facilities.  The Government can not predict at this time when that transition might occur, but anticipates as long as two years may be possible.   MDA/DET is conducting market research of those firms mentioned above that have prior experience demonstrating their capability to design, develop, fabricate, maintain, integrate and test target missile systems and instrumentation packages, and provide services for launching low fidelity ballistic missile targets to demonstrate Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) asset readiness for major tests, the cost of which typically ranges from $250,000 to $2 Million, dependent upon system complexity. It is envisioned that all activities associated with the manufacturing, major testing, and integration would be in the Huntsville, AL area, but the contractor may propose an alternate site if that alternative would be in the Government?s best interest. These systems will support multiple unique customers at different ranges with varying missile configurations.  The target missile systems/test and launch requirements include:

1)	Utilization of excess government furnished property (GFP) rocket motors, aft skirts and fin sets along with existing hardware such as interstage rings and use of existing mature technology to fabricate needed material, integrate and successfully launch the target missiles. Some target system configurations may require the fabrication of interstages, skirts and fin sets.  If, after analysis of requirements and considering available GFP motors and other assets, it is determined that these assets can not meet requirements, the contractor would make a recommendation for commercial motor(s) as alternative solutions. 

2)	Requested missiles will normally be flown unguided and without a flight termination system (FTS) from rail launchers at a number of different launch sites such as WSMR, VAFB, PMRF, and Pt Mugu.  For some missions, it is expected that a supplemental system will be required to minimize launch dispersions or to stay inside a very highly restricted launch corridor. 

3)	A number of separation planes on the mission/test article based on the number of rocket motors.

4)	Separation systems to reduce tip off rates.

5)	Requirements for the encryption of data.

6)	Articles in the field of regard to include the nose cone, attitude control/payload section, items ejected as payload, and spent rocket motor(s).  

7)	Attitude control/payload section with or without a spent rocket motor attached could be required to hold attitude, tumble, roll, ordnance initiation devices, etc. at prescribed mission times or altitudes.  

8)	Selected sections such as the nose cone and attitude control/payload section would usually require an instrumentation and telemetry system to provide position, velocity, roll rate, and attitude data for collection

9)	Additional instrumentation in the form of pressure transducers, thermocouples, accelerometers, etc. may be required based on specific mission needs.

10)	 Redstone Technical Test Center (RTTC), Redstone Arsenal, AL will be utilized for all major testing such as environmental, temperature cycling, etc.

All efforts will be closely coordinated with the government and their selected support contractors to accomplish mission objectives.  

This Request for Information (RFI) seeks to identify those firms that have the ability to meet the above requirements.  This RFI does not in any way constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), and as such, shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for proposal preparation costs supporting submission of a response to this RFI.  Sources possessing the capabilities to satisfy these requirements are invited to submit an unclassified capability paper. The paper should be at least five (5) pages and not more than ten (10) pages on 8.5 x 11 inch paper with font no smaller than 12 point, one inch margins in a Microsoft Word or Adobe file format.  Each page of the submission shall contain the document identifier in the document header.  Respondents should label any information contained in the paper that is considered proprietary.  The paper should include/address the following:  The name of the organization, point of contact, disclosure of  type/size business status, and information in relation to the following review criteria: (1) The contractor must be a United States corporation, educational, or business entity.  This acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  (2) Technical approach or concept to fabricating required material, manufacturing, testing and integrating low cost fidelity targets, supporting test range requirements and providing target launch services, (3) Capability to provide the necessary design, development and verification of equipment to help reduce the target system launch dispersion footprint for longer range missions or when the mission requires a tightly controlled corridor, (4) Relevant experience with low cost fidelity targets, and (5) Relevant personnel, equipment and facilities for target missile systems manufacturing, integration and testing.  The preferred place of performance is the Huntsville, AL area, including equipment for this requirement and if the proposed facility is owned or leased, but the contractor may propose an alternate site with adequate justification.

<SUBJECT>66--DESIGN, BUILD AND TEST DETECTORS FOR A PICOWATT INFRARED RADIOMETER
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for market research purposes.  

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  

DESIGN, BUILD AND TEST DETECTORS FOR A PICOWATT INFRARED RADIOMETER
The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) is seeking Contractors with expertise in the fabrication and building of custom infrared detectors. The final detector must have a spectral range of 2 microns to 30 microns, a frequency response of 10 kilohertz (kHz) or greater, an internal quantum efficiency of greater than 99 percent from 4 microns to 28 microns, be compatible for use in a high vacuum (0.000000001 Torr), and be operational in a background environment from 2 kelvins (K) to 15 kelvins (K).

The Low Background Infrared (LBIR) Facility at NIST is responsible for maintaining the infrared calibration standards for the United States over the 2 micron to 30 microns spectral range in low temperature (less than 80 K) background environments.

The LBIR Facility is researching a potential requirement to develop the ability to calibrate infrared signals from the 10 nanowatt (nW) to 1 picowatt (pW) level to an accuracy of 0.1 percent or better of the measured signal.

To fulfill this requirement, the LBIR facility may develop a new trapping radiometer based on solid state, electronic detectors as opposed to its traditional thermally based cryogenic radiometers. At this time it is believed that As doped silicon, blocked impurity band (BIB) detectors can be made to have the 99 percent internal quantum efficiency that is required to make a solid state detector based trapping radiometer that is suitable for calibration activity over the desired infrared power range to accuracies of 0.1 percent.

Although As:Si BIB detectors are expected to be able to fulfill the requirements, NIST is also researching the availability of other detectors that will meet the following requirements:

1.  Linear response of better than 1 percent from 1 femtowatt (fW) to 10 nW;

2.  A frequency response with less than 1 percent roll-off up to a frequency of 10 KHz;

3.  Noise equivalent power of less than 0.1 percent of the signal being measured between 1 pW and 10 nW;

4.  A spectral range of 2 to 30 microns, with no sensitivity above 33 microns;

5.  Capable of having and active area of 3 cm squared, with no defects;

6.  Variations in spatial uniformity of less than 1 percent within the active area of the detector;

7.  Internal quantum efficiency of greater than 99 percent, with external quantum efficiency that deviates from 99 percent only due to reflection from the detector;

8.  Reflectivity that has a total diffuse reflectivity of less than 0.03 percent over the entire spectral range;

9.  Operational temperature range of 14 K or less;

10. Operational background temperature of 2 K to 15 K;

11.  Compatible with vacuums of 0.000001 Torr when at ambient temperatures.

These specifications are provided for market research purposes only.  Final specifications shall be determined based on information received and NIST?s minimum requirements.  NIST anticipates the need to acquire a quantity of at least 50 detectors. 

The delivery time is anticipated to be 18 months or less.   During the fabrication process the Contractor must supply samples to NIST for inspection and testing that will be used to finalize the final photo mask for the delivered detectors.

Qualified Contractors must provide detailed information on their experience and expertise in building the same or similar detectors to Carol A. Wood, Contract Specialist, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.  

Submissions must be received by 3:00 p.m. local time on 
November 30, 2006.  Original submissions are required.  E-mail and Fax submission shall not be accepted.

Contractors shall identify their business size, (small, small-disadvantaged, hub-zone, large etc.) in accordance with North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.

STATEMENT OF WORK
DARPA 50th Anniversary Display
October 20th, 2007

1.0  SUMMARY 

The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) seeks to obtain a contractor to develop and produce a display that showcases DARPA?s 50th Anniversary. This exhibit will be displayed at the DARPATech Conference at the Anaheim Marriott in Anaheim, CA August 6- 9, 2007. DARPATech is conducted approximately every 18 months to inform the private industry, the academic community, and the military services of the DARPA mission. The last DARPATech was held in August 2005 and is described at http://www.darpa.mil/DARPATech2005/index.html . 

The 50th Anniversary display will occupy approximately 10ft(width) x 60ft (length) x 15ft(height) of exhibit hall space (See attached floor plan). There may also be separate pedestals or stand alone items that will need to be developed and set up for additional content/displays throughout the lobby and exhibit halls of the Marriott.  The objective is to create a standalone display that will provide a centerpiece to the DARPATech 07 exhibits and communicate DARPA's technical achievements since 1958.  

As an option, the contractor may be asked to recreate the display at the 50th Anniversary Conference and Dinner at the Washington DC Hilton on 10 April 2008.

For the performance of the requirements specified in this Statement of Work, DARPA will identify as a minimum a 50th Anniversary Display Coordinator and planning staff.   These personnel will perform the following duties:

Provide a comprehensive list of content elements and assist the contractor in understanding the nature and context of specific content in DARPA's history.
Obtain public release approval for all content.  (Department of Defense regulations require material scheduled for public release undergo a security review.  DARPA has processes in place to conduct such a review).  Provide government recommendations/approvals to the contractor promptly in all cases where the contract calls for technical approval.

"late" and will be handled by the Government as indicated by FAR 52.212-1.

7. Communications. The Government intends to evaluate all offers received and award without discussions. However, in order to support evaluations and selection, the Government may choose to obtain proposal clarifications and / or hold discussions, with one or more of the offerors.

(E) SUBCONTRACTING & TEAMING ARRANGEMENTS - Subcontracting and
Contractor Team arrangements are permissible in response to the RFQ. The following guidance applies regardless of any arrangements made between the prime and subcontractors:
?	All proposal submissions must come under the Prime Contractor
?	The Prime Contractor will, at all times, be solely responsible for performance and
	adherence to the standards in the task order
?	The Prime Contractor is responsible for compliance with DARPA?s operating
	procedures, including ODC qualifications, travel approval and submission of 	backup
?	materials, and adherence to quality standards; and
?	Only the Prime Contractor will have any privity of contractual arrangement (e.g., access to DARPA staff).
Proposed arrangements with subcontractors must be clearly identified in proposals to the Government. Identification must include the scope of the work to be performed as well as the method of inclusion (i.e. labor category and rates or other direct cost (ODC)). If a task order is awarded to a contractor who proposed a non-schedule subcontractor as an ODC, that subcontracting arrangement is not subject to the GSA Industrial Funding Fee (IFF). Typically, ODC labor is capped at five percent (5%) of total task order labor value unless other, specific conditions are met and called out in the RFQ language. While there are many variations of team arrangements, DARPA adheres to the traditional "prime contractor-subcontractor" interpretation. At all times, the Prime Contractor is responsible for performance and management, regardless of team size, makeup, or flow-down subcontracting agreements.

(F) RFQ EVALUATION CRITERIA - The government will make a single award
resulting from this RFQ to the responsible Offeror whose conforming business and technical offer is considered most advantageous to the government. In order to support evaluations and selection, the Government may choose to obtain proposal clarifications and/or hold discussions, at its discretion, with one or more of the offerors. The Government will evaluate offers based on the following criteria listed below:

1.  The overall approach in supporting the development and production of an exhibit showcasing DARPA's 50th Anniversary.  

2.  Past performance that shows experience in developing and producing conference displays and exhibits (evidenced by samples of prior work) and an ability to manage time and cost sensitive tasks.

3.  The quality and availability of the Contractor's Key Personnel as evidenced by prior corporate experience related to the proposed tasks.  

4.  Cost realism and Reasonableness.  

Relative order of importance for the evaluation factors is as follows:
a and b-Equal and more important than c
c -More important than d

As a competitive "best value" solicitation, the Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest bidder, at its discretion.

(G) AWARD ? Contractors will be notified by email regarding the disposition of their proposals. These notifications will be issued at the time the CO issues the contract to the selected Contractor.

(H) QUESTIONS - Questions regarding this RFQ and requests for Layout of the Marquis Ballroom shall be directed only to
50thDisplayFabrication@darpa.mil.

Small Business Office (SBO) moving from Bldg 11777 (1st Floor) to Bldg 8500

1.  Scope of Work:  30 CONS and SBO are currently located in two (2) separate buildings.  However, both of these units will be relocated to 2 different areas in Bldg 8500 under one (1) single move contract.  The move will be broken down into 2 phases.  The first phase will include the relocation of the 30 CONS and SBO Government furnished items.  The second phase will be the relocation of the 30 CONS servers, UPS, and associated electronic equipment. The time between the first phase and second phase shall not be longer than 6 months.  30 CONS will relocate to a furnished area in Bldg 8500 and therefore will leave most of the stand-alone and systems furniture behind.

Moving work includes, but is not limited to providing moving boxes, labor and expertise to relocate all Government items of the 30 CONS from Building 7015 (2nd Floor) to Building 8500. In addition, this work also includes the relocation of the Small Business Office and all existing furniture from Bldg 11777 to Bldg 8500.  The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, transportation and supervision required to accomplish the relocation.  

1.1  Description of Services:  The contractor shall perform the following tasks:

1.1.1  The contractor shall provide sufficient boxes at a minimum of 2 weeks prior to the actual scheduled move date or immediately after the contract is awarded to the 30th Contracting Squadron and Small Business Office personnel to allow them enough time to pack their items for the relocation to Bldg 8500.
The Contractor will be required to pack Government items that are not already in boxes on the day of the move.

Answer: Refer to paragraph 2.d. This paragraph requires that carpet be laid with a minimum of seams, among other things. However, the government doesn't expect carpet installed in long hallways to be without seams. 

1. GENERAL:
a.   Carpet is not government furnished. Contractor shall supply carpet and deliver it to building 1292 for installation. See attached drawings for locations of new carpet.

b.   All other materials (adhesives, edge strips, floor stone, seam joining materials, etc.) are to be furnished by the Contractor and of a type suitable for the purpose intended.

c.   There is existing carpet to be removed. Contractor is responsible for off-base disposal.

d.   Hazardous Materials (HM) Approval. Contractor shall submit a Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for each chemical and/or compound proposed carpet or vinyl installation to the Base Bioenvironmental Office (90 ADOS/SGGB) for review and approval prior to delivery to the base. A HM is defined in Federal Standard DED-STD-313D, Tables I and II. The definition of materials presenting a health or physical hazard is found in OSHA 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.1200(c).

e.   Hazardous Materials Management. All HM shall be managed, stored and monitored in full compliance with all applicable local, state, federal and Air Force regulations. Contractors who bring hazardous materials onto FEW AFB without authorization are responsible for any punitive or regulatory actions. Contractors are responsible for proper disposal of containers/hazardous material. Flammable liquids shall be stored in an approved fireproof storage cabinet. All chemicals shall be secured and properly stored when not in use.

f.   Prohibited Hazardous Materials.

All materials (both new and recycled) shall be the most suitable and highest grade and type for the intended use unless otherwise indicated. They shall be produced by a manufacturer regularly engaged in manufacturing or fabricating similar products with a history of successful production acceptable to the Contracting Office. When names of manufacturers or models are
 
listed, the purpose is to give examples of products meeting the specifications and to provide a basis for comparison subject to the following: (1) The product is equivalent to the specified product meets or exceeds the requirements of the specifications and is otherwise suitable for the intended use. (2) The warranty meets or exceeds that of the specified product and the requirements of the specifications. (3) The Contractor coordinates the installation and makes any necessary changes at no additional cost to the Government.

The main legal requirements for an Affirmative Procurement Program (APP) are derived from Executive Order 13101 dated 14 September 1998 (http;//www.ofee.gov) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Section 6002 (http://www.ornl.gov/ornlp2/sec6002.htm). This policy requires action by the Federal Government or its authorized agents to make more efficient use of natural resources by maximizing recycling and preventing waste whenever possible. Specifically, it mandates procurement of the five EPA guideline items; calls for review of government plans and specifications to eliminate virgin material requirements; requires recycling programs and requires consideration of: recovered materials use, reuse of products, life cycle cost analysis, ease of recycling, and use of environmentally preferable products.

NOTE CHANGES:
a. The response date is changed from 26 Oct 2006 to 3 Nov 2006.
b. Clauses were inadvertently omitted from the original posting. Clauses are now included. They are located directly after the statement of work.
c. Clarification of offeror's question. Question: Should the carpet be laid to use the least amount (more seams) or should it be laid to have the least seams? In particular the offeror is considering the long hallways in this building.
Answer: Refer to paragraph 2.d. This paragraph requires that carpet be laid with a minimum of seams, among other things. However, the government doesn't expect carpet installed in long hallways to be without seams.

1. GENERAL:
a.  Carpet and vinyl base are not government furnished. Contractor shall supply carpet and vinyl base and deliver it to building 340 for installation. See attached drawings for locations of new carpet and vinyl base.

b.  All other materials (adhesives, edge strips, floor stone, seam joining materials, etc.) are to be furnished by the Contractor and of a type suitable for the purpose intended.

c.   There is existing carpet to be removed. Contractor is responsible for off-base disposal.

d.    There is asbestos containing floor tile in the areas of work outlined in this contract. Care needs to be taken during the removal of existing carpet to not disturb the ACM tile beneath.

e.     Hazardous Materials (HM) Approval. Contractor shall submit a Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for each chemical and/or compound proposed carpet or vinyl installation to the Base Bioenvironmental Office (90 ADOS/SGGB) for review and approval prior to delivery to the base. A HM is defined in Federal Standard DED-STD-313D, Tables I and II. The definition of materials presenting a health or physical hazard is found in OSHA 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.1200(c).

f.     Hazardous Materials Management. All HM shall be managed, stored and monitored in full compliance with all applicable local, state, federal and Air Force regulations. Contractors who bring hazardous materials onto FEW AFB without authorization are responsible for any punitive or regulatory actions. Contractors are responsible for proper disposal of containers/hazardous material. Flammable liquids shall be stored in an approved fireproof storage cabinet. All chemicals shall be secured and properly stored when not in use.

g.    Prohibited Hazardous Materials. Prohibited materials include those that contain Class 1 ozone-depleting substances (including CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and methyl bromide) per Air Force Policy and as regulated by Title VI of the Clean Air Act, specifically Sections 601-607. Other prohibited construction materials include lead (i.e. lead-based paint), asbestos, PCBs or other hazardous substances.

h.    New and Recycled Materials and Equipment Purchasing. All materials shall be new or newly manufactured using recycled materials unless otherwise indicated. All materials (both new and recycled) shall be the most suitable and highest grade and type for the intended use unless otherwise indicated. They shall be produced by a manufacturer regularly engaged in manufacturing or fabricating similar products with a history of successful production acceptable to the Contracting Office. When names of manufacturers or models are listed, the purpose is to give examples of products meeting the specifications and to provide a basis for comparison subject to the following: (1) The product is equivalent to the specified product meets or exceeds the requirements of the specifications and is otherwise suitable for the intended use. (2) The warranty meets or exceeds that of the specified product and the requirements of the specifications. (3) The Contractor coordinates the installation and makes any necessary schedule changes at no additional cost to the Government. (4) The Contractor waives claims for any time extension associated with the use of the product.

This is required by Presidential Executive Order and Section 6002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (42 U.S.C. 6962). The use of recycled products is mandatory unless they are not available within a reasonable time frame, or if the cost exceeds the cost of a non-recycled item or if they do not meet the technical requirements of the project, or if they are not available from at least two (2) sources so as to maintain a satisfactory level of competition. The construction materials included under this requirement are all types of carpet made of polyester fiber and floor tile containing recovered rubber or plastic. The use of other recycled products is encouraged.

j. Recycled Products Reporting. Contractors must compile a "Recycled Products Report" for the Resource Recovery and Recycling Manager at 90 CES/CEV listing the total quantity recycled products used. Submit the report through the COAR at the end of the contract period or at the end of the calendar year, whichever comes first.

k. Material Storage. Contractors shall protect materials during delivery, storage, handling and installation per manufacturer's printed instructions. Materials should be delivered in original containers or packaging with labels intact. Storage locations shall not interfere with work of other trades. Acceptable temperature and humidity conditions must be maintained. Work areas shall be enclosed, watertight, and heated as necessary to protect finish materials during and after installation.

l. Affirmative Procurement Guidance. The use of recycled material shall follow requirements based upon Department of the Air Force Space Command Affirmative Procurement Program Policy and Guidance Letter dated 8 April 2002. The main legal requirements for an Affirmative Procurement Program (APP) are derived from Executive Order 13101 dated 14 September 1998 (http;//www.ofee.gov) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Section 6002 (http://www.ornl.gov/ornlp2/sec6002.htm).
