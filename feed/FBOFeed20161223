<DESC><strong>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.</strong><br /><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking to support a prospective clinical trial aimed at evaluating the non-inferiority of 1 versus 2 doses of the HPV vaccines. The contract will also permit an additional extension to the follow-up of women in NCI's ongoing Costa Rica Vaccine Trial (CVT), which initially followed women for 10 years and will now extend that follow-up out to 15 years among a subset of participants. CVT showed similar HPV vaccine efficacy over four years among women who received one, two and three doses of the HPV16/18 vaccine, and stable antibody responses have been observed throughout the seven years of follow-up accrued to date in CVT, following up on these discoveries and further documenting the protection afforded by fewer doses could result in a monumental, global public health breakthrough. Thus, this new trial that will directly evaluate the protection afforded by single-dose and two-dose regimens of the prophylactic HPV vaccines. Continuation of the current cohort will document durability of antibody titers among women who received fewer doses.
<p>The services will be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541712. It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement type contract will be awarded with a twelve (12) month base period and five 1-year options.  The base period of performance will begin in 2017.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available electronically at a later date and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov.  <strong>WE ENCOURAGE ALL RESPONSIBLE SOURCES, PARTICULARLY SMALL BUSINESSES, TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE AGENCY. </strong> This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile or email transmissions will be accepted. <strong> IT IS THE OFFERORS' RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE-MENTIONED SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS.</strong></p>

<DESC>PROJECT TITLE: NEXRAD Radar DC Servo Motors
<p>LOCATION OF WORK: Vendor's Facility</p>
<p>NAICS CODE: 335312, Motor and Generator Manufacturing. The small-business size standard is 1,250 employees.</p>
<p>SET-ASIDE STATUS: Small Business Set-Aside</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking sources capable of providing new DC Servo-motors to be used in the NEXRAD WSR-88D Antenna Positioning System that is a form, fit, function, replacement of the legacy DC Servo Motor, and is compatible with the existing servo amplifier and servo choke.</p>
<p>NEXRAD (Next-Generation Weather Radar) is a network of 168 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the National Weather Service (NWS), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Air Force (USAF). NEXRAD detects weather events and is the primary detection system used by the NWS to support issuance of severe weather warnings, and used by the FAA and USAF to support safety of flight operations. The WSR-88D Radar Operations Center (ROC) is responsible for complete life-cycle support of the radar network including system engineering, configuration management, and logistics analysis and support.</p>
<p>Each servo-motor is interchangeable between axis (Azimuth and Elevation) and shall be designed to accommodate this function and shall be in-field serviceable. NOAA is not seeking vendors to design, develop, and then produce this requirement; we are seeking vendors already capable of providing a working solution, as there are known sources of motors in the marketplace which meet all requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to meeting all requirements of the attached Vendor Item Drawing (VID), any product proposed to support this requirement shall not have proprietary limitations that restrict the future repair of the motor to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).</p>
<p>The contractor shall be capable of manufacturing and delivering up to 500 DC Servo Motors, P/N 2200220-201 or equivalent. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) was Electo-Mechanical Systems.</p>
<p>The salient characteristics of the DC Servo Motor are documented in the attached Vendor Item Drawing (VID), number 2200220-201. There are 3 sources for the DC Servo Motor documented in the VID as "suggested sources". These suggested sources have previously provided motors for test and evaluation for use in the WSR-88D NEXRAD radar that have demonstrated their ability to be compliant with all requirements. Any product that is proposed shall meet all requirements of the VID without significant modification. If a commercial product, other than those listed in the VID, meets all requirements, a sample will be requested to support Government inspection and testing in order to validate suitability of the product.</p>
<p>All dates listed below are tentative dates. Official dates will be provided when the solicitation is released.</p>
<p>TENTATIVE SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: November 10, 2016</p>
<p>TENTATIVE PROPOSAL DUE DATE: November 20, 2016</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED AWARD DATE: December 20, 2016</p>
<p>DELIVERY TIMEFRAME: January 20, 2017 - November 24, 2017</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION: To be eligible for award, a contractor must (1) be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov. All offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier. A DUNS number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet at (800) 333-0505 or online at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform.</p>

This procurement shall be in accordance with FAR 52.225-11/12, Buy American Act Construction Materials.  The firm needs to be able to demonstrate knowledge, current relevant qualifications, experience, bonding, and the capability to perform a design/build construction contract similar to the scope indicated. 

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions.
 Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following: Price, Factor 1  Experience, Factor 2  Past Performance, Factor 3  Safety, and Factor 4  Small Business Utilization.  The Offeror whose proposal is technically acceptable with the lowest evaluated price will be considered the best value to the Government.

THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The RFP will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fbo.gov, and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) https://www.neco.navy.mil/ on or about February 27, 2015. No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THE SOLICITATION.

No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with this announcement, attending pre-proposal conferences or any follow-up information requests.
  

Results of Sources Sought
Two sources sought notices were used to conduct market research and to determine if qualified small businesses were interested in performing this project.  The first sources sought notice was issued using solicitation number N4425515MKTG2, which was posted on June 26, 2014. Two responses were received and did not demonstrate relevant experience as defined in the notice. A second sources sought notice was issued on 04 September 2014, with the intent of providing an additional opportunity for small businesses to express interest in this project.  In order to stimulate small business interest, the required experience elements were decreased. The Government received four responses in the second notice.
 The firms did not possess the relevant specialized experience as defined in the notice or could not meet the bonding capacity.  The contracting officer determined there is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or more responsible small business concerns in accordance with FAR 19.502-2.  Based on the market research, it was determined that this procurement will be solicited utilizing full and open competition.  The Seattle Small Business Administration (SBA) Office concurred with this decision.

<p>Anticipated Issue Date 09 JAN 2017 - Anticipated Closing Date 08 FEB 2017 Time 2:00PM EST</p>
<p>Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane), Crane, IN intends to award an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) service contract for a maximum twelve month period of performance with CSRA LLC, 1201 M. Street SE, Suite 400, Washington DC 20003.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) task orders will be issued as required for the continuation of information technology services support for NSWC Crane. In accordance with the statement of work, tasks include professional, technical, and administrative support for IT tasks required including support of new and existing applications and programs and support of RDT&amp;E and Boundary Three Communities of Interest (B3COI) networks.</p>
<p>This effort will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is the unacceptable lapse in information technology support and compliance of critical NSWC Crane systems and networks. Any interruption in the support of these NSWC Crane systems and networks would result in reduced warfighter effectiveness due to loss of full mission capability across NSWC Crane. CSRA is the only vendor capable of continuing to provide the Navy uninterrupted information technology support services.</p>
<p>A formal solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested entities may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. Direct questions to Ms. Laura Armes by email (laura.armes@navy.mil). Please reference the last four digits of the solicitation number when responding to this notice.</p>

The fundamental outcome of this procurement is to deliver preventative maintenance and repair support to 95 buildings that contain roughly 10,000 pieces of equipment and that span over 5 million square feet of space at Fort Jackson, SC. A high level summary of the required functions is as follows:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) <em>Preventative Maintenance (PM) and service calls</em>. This refers to all-encompassing preventive facilities maintenance for the DPW's various buildings and equipment (including, for example, HVAC, electrical, and plumbing systems, water heaters, emergency generator units, overhead doors, plumbing and fixtures, backflow preventers, grease traps, roof drains/gutters, access control systems, kitchen equipment, oil-water Separators, underground/above ground storage tanks, Central Energy Plant Boilers etc.). As a component of the preventative maintenance program, service calls are encompassed up to certain limits of liability that will be specified in contract Performance Work Statement, which will be posted with the formal RFP announcement. Service calls will be for minor ad-hoc, reactive repair work for outages, breakages, damages, etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) <em>Facility Investment and Maintenance Services</em>. This refers to larger projects for service repairs and maintenance. These projects are also ad-hoc, but are generally more complex and require more detailed job planning. Primarily these projects consist of infrastructure sustainment, as well as minimal restoration and modernization work to repair or replace facility components that are expected to occur periodically throughout the life cycle of facilities. Examples include roof repairs, refinishing of wall surfaces, repairing and replacement of heating and cooling systems, replacing tile and carpeting, and similar types of work.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SITE VISIT/PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE</span></strong>:<br />The USACE Charleston / Fort Jackson DPW plans to host a pre-proposal conference following the formal RFP announcement and offer an opportunity to tour some or all of the facilities to be covered under this contract. Prospective offerors are strongly encouraged to attend the pre-proposal conference and visit all the locations made available pursuant to FAR 52.237.1--this will allow them the best opportunity to fully understand the scope of this project and anticipate the related costs in order to provide the best possible value to the Government.

<DESC>This is a Market Survey to locate additional sources for the Selected Spare Parts which are part of the Trailer Mounted Electric Power Plant III (EPP III) used with the PATRIOT Missile Defense System, NSNs: 6110-12-345-6331 and 6150-12-343-3735. The EPP III is the main electric power source for the PATRIOT Missile Defense System and the selected spare parts have been identified for maintenance and sustainment purposes. NSN: 6110-12-345-6331 is for the N2 module (AKA voltage regulator) for the 150 kW Generator Set and prepares and regulates exciter voltage in order to regulate the output voltage. The N2 module consists of the Equal Power Distribution, Linear Regulator, Averaging Circuit, and Voltage Sensing Transformer boards. NSN: 6150-12-343-3735 is the L3 single phase power cable assembly that mates the L3 load terminal on the 150 kW Generator Set with the PDU. This acquisition is for a five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract. The forecast for each NSN ranges from 1-60 per year over five years. The current source for these selected spare parts is JENOPTIK Defense &amp; Civil Systems (formerly Lechmotoren GmbH), CAGE: D0857, in Altenstadt, Germany. Detailed technical data for the manufacture or acceptance of these items is not available from the Army. Suppliers capable of furnishing this unit must so indicate, by writing via email to scott.h.mahoney4.civ@mail.mil. The response must include production lead time, production capacity by month, surge capacity, number of years part will be available, ranges for price breaks if applicable or any other information that could affect the acquisition, supply and delivery of the parts. The response should also include documentation such as a copy of a purchase order if the supplier was a vendor to the listed source or a statement from listed source demonstrating that the supplier can, in fact, supply the Army with this unit from the supplier listed above. Successful supplier may be required to warrant that the item supplied will satisfactorily perform when used for the purpose intended by the Army. The NAICS Codes for these items are 335311, 335931, and 335999. For more information contact Scott Mahoney, RDER-PRP-G, (443) 395-6242. The deadline for response is 6 January 2017.

<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The current fleet of Raven<sup>TM</sup> (RQ-11B) and Puma<sup>TM</sup> (RQ-20A) AECV (All Environment Capable Variant) SUAS is managed by the TUAS PdO, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. The RQ-11B and RQ-20A are Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Targeting, Acquisition, (RSTA) tools. The systems transmit live airborne video images, compass headings and location information to a Ground Control Station (GCS) and to a Laptop Computer. This capability enables operators to navigate, search for targets, recognize terrain, and record all information for analysis. A system generally consists of the following basic components: Unmanned Aircraft (UAs); Ground Control Station (GCS); Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) Payloads; RSTA Computer Kit and Field Repair Kit. An Initial Spares Package (ISP) is included for operation and support of the basic system components. Current systems fielded are the RQ-11B and the RQ-20A; other systems may be added in the future.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued by Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk, Philadelphia Office on behalf of Commander, Naval Air Force Reserve (CNAFR).  CNAFR has a requirement for Mission Planning Technology Support Services.  Mission Planning Technology consists of software and web-based applications that allow aircraft pilots access to maps, charts, weather, intelligence and aircraft performance data for use in developing mission planning navigation solutions such as routes, approaches, terminal procedures, communications setting, flight/mission calculations (fuel and leg times,) and other pertinent aircraft operational data.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in <strong>January</strong>.   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period.  The Open Period is the 1st through the 7th of each month, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  Offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.<br /><br />The Open Period for <strong>January</strong> is January 1, 2017 to January 7, 2017, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.&nbsp;
<p><br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2017 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2016, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2017 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY17 AAAP RLP Package and  each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 17-Reg02 and must be located within Region 2.</p>
<p><br />To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent: NB672040-17-00334<br />Status: Open<br />Description of Contract Action: Antenna Positioner.<br />Post Date: 12/23/2016<br />Close Date: 01/05/2017<br />File Name: NB672040-17-00334 / Antenna Positioner.<br />Contact Points: Dennis Fuentes, Contract Specialist (303) 497.5573<br /><br />This requirement is conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b). This is a notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis and is not a request for competitive proposals. Firms who want to challenge the sole source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates your firm's ability to provide an equivalent service as described below. Interested parties must provide rationale as to why they should be considered. All interested firms must respond to this special notice by January 05, 2017, 11:00am, Mountain Time to Dennis M. Fuentes at dennis.fuentes@nist.gov. Responses received will be assessed; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion for the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. NIST will not reimburse for any costs connected with providing the capability information.<br />Overview: The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing metrology for future wireless systems by use of reverberation chamber techniques. Reverberation chambers allow free-field, over-the-air testing of wireless devices with both removable and integrated antennas. NIST is conducting fundamental research on the use of these chambers. This research requires a great deal of both flexibility and precision in the location, orientation, and polarization of antennas within the test chamber. A four-axis (translation, rotation, polarization, and height) antenna positioner that is remotely controllable from outside the chamber is required. A fiber-optic control cable is required within the chamber to prevent stray, uncontrolled coupling of electrical signals. The antenna positioner dimensions have been chosen to allow use within three different NIST reverberation chambers. They provide the maximum positioning range within these three chambers. <br />Description: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate and award on a sole-source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b) with AP Americas, in Flower Mound, Texas. To perform this service, the contractor must have an antenna positioner compatible with an existing motor controller (Maturo NCD) and large-form-factor turntable (Maturo TT1.2MF). Sole Source determination is based on the market research that shows only one vendor can comply to this critical process that meets all of the NIST technical requirements.
<p>The NAICS code 334515 - Instrument Manufacturing for Measuring and Testing Electricity and Electrical Signals, and the Small Business Size Standard is 750 employees will be used.</p>

Work order requests will describe the work to be performed/accomplished, as well as designate the date the work is to be accomplished.  If a due date is not specified in the work order request, standard Service Requests timeframes apply.</p>
<p>If the work requested by the user/Government requires support/service(s) to be performed by more than one functional area (i.e. LAN, EUS, Telecom, etc.), tasks shall be utilized within the current ticketing system.  In this situation, the work order would capture the overall work to be performed and individual tasks would be created for each functional area to perform their respective duties/work to accomplish the requested work. The level of criticality placed on a work order/task is not predictive of a specific due date.  The criticality is an evaluation of the work to be performed relating to the respective ESA and/or functional areas' missions; classification will be either "Routine," or "Priority."  The Contractor shall anticipate projects that are highly critical to the respective ESA and/or functional areas' mission(s) but may take several days/weeks to accomplish and vice versa.<br />All actions in response to work orders/tasks shall be documented within the work order/task resolution field(s).</p>

<p>1.8.3 Performance Metrics: Please see Attachment 3 for Performance Metric Information	<br />1.9 Performance Review and Payment</p>
<p>1.9.1 	Purpose of Measures</p>
<p>Performance measures will be used to assess the Contractor's performance under this contract issued in order to determine whether the Contractor is performing at acceptable levels in order to apply disincentives to contract payments.  Payments will be comprised of the base amount plus a disincentive/incentive component.  <br />The Government will make objective and subjective assessments of the Contractor's performance to determine whether contract performance is acceptable.  The Contractor is expected to perform all functions in a professional manner and prepare accurate and timely documentation. Progress will be tracked based on the milestone event when the Contractor receives a specific tasking.  Performance may vary with the complexity of the acquisition and/or technical document.   The number of completed actions will be balanced against the quality of this output.  It is expected that the documentation and procedures will comply with all major regulatory and process requirements and agency policies and procedures. <br />1.9.2	 Performance Measurements</p>
<p>The performance measurements under this contract shall be based on timeliness and quality of the work and deliverables provided by the Contractor under the contract.  These measurements are defined as:</p>
<p>&bull;	Timeliness - The completion of tasks and/or the submission of deliverables within the schedule set forth by the government during the performance of the contract.</p>
<p>&bull;	Quality - The quality of work completed under the resulting tasks will be measured based on the Government's determination of the validity, accuracy, clarity and usefulness of a deliverable or if the work performance met the expected outcomes as was communicated to the Contractor by the government.</p>
<p>Performance measurement metrics - The vendor's performance will be monitored by the DLA J6 COR/COTRs for each TO using one or more of the following methods of surveillance:  random sampling, 100% inspection, and customer feedback.  The vendor shall perform at full performance; a 100% expected quality- and timeliness- level applies (i.e. meets or exceeds the requirements, no customer complaints).  The vendor is paid 100% of monthly invoice if they meet this requirement.  These findings will be the basis for the amount paid for the task for that month.  The tasks will be rated on the performance of the vendor on the timeliness and quality of the services provided using the adjectival ratings for each criterion as shown below.  For any rating less than "Good," the KO will review the performance documentation and make the final determination for the rating.</p>
<p>Below are the Performance Standards that will be used in evaluating performance in determining the amount of the payment owed to the vendor.  Performance standards and ratings are designed to determine if performance exceeds, meets, or does not meet a given metric and acceptable quality level.  The performance will be rated by the DLA J6 COR/COTR prior to payment.  These findings will be the basis for the amount paid for that period. Note: The application of these performance ratings or failure of the government to apply these performance ratings does not waive any of the government's rights to damages under this contract.  The following overall ratings shall be used:</p>
<p>Good - Performance meets or exceeds contract requirements in terms of timeliness and quality.  The DLA J6 COR recommends and the KO will make a determination to pay the contract 100% of the invoice amount.<br />Fair - Performance meets contract requirements with either only minor performance issues or minor timeliness issues.  The performance or timeliness issues do not adversely impact the mission of the Agency.  The DLA J6 COR recommends and the KO will make a determination to pay the vendor 90% of the invoice amount.<br />Poor - Performance narrowly meets contract requirements by at least one of the following: bordering on unacceptability in terms of or quality of performance, bordering on unacceptability in terms of timeliness, or potentially having an adverse impact on the mission of the Agency.  DLA J6 COR recommends and the KO will make a determination to pay the vendor 80% of the invoice amount.<br />Unacceptable - Performance has been at a less than acceptable level in terms of timeliness or quality.  Possible issues include, but are not limited to:  missed milestones, low quality documents requiring multiple reviews and rewrites, significant or serious complaints submitted by the customers, documents that do not comply with acquisition or policy regulations, or one or more cure notices have been issued.  Payment will be withheld pending resolution of cure notice(s).  Termination for default or cause may result.</p>
<p>The ratings, as described in the table above, will be based on the performance of the vendor on the timeliness and quality of the services provided using the rating scale for each criterion as shown below.</p>
<p>Quality<br />Good	Meets or exceeds contract requirements in terms of quality of work performed.<br />Fair	Performance meets contract requirements with only minor issues and the issues do not adversely impact the mission of the Agency.<br />Poor	Performance narrowly meets contract requirements and either borders on unacceptability in terms of quality, or adverse impact on the mission of the Agency is possible.<br />&emsp;<br />Unacceptable	Quality of performance has been at a less than acceptable level.  Possible issues include, but are not limited to:  low quality documents requiring multiple reviews and rewrites, significant or serious complaints submitted by the customers, documents that did not comply with acquisition or policy regulations or one or more cure notices have been issued by the KO.</p>
<p><br /> Timeliness<br />Good	Meets or exceeds contract requirements in terms of timeliness of delivery.<br />Fair	Minor timeliness issues that do not adversely impact the mission of the Agency.<br />Poor	Timeliness issues that are not minor or borders on unacceptability.  Adverse impact on the mission of the Agency is possible.<br />Unacceptable	Vendor failed to meet the timeliness requirements.  Possible issues include, but are not limited to; one or more deliverables not submitted on time or missed milestones.  One or more cure notices may have been issued by the KO.</p>
<p>Disincentives are applied for 90%, 80% or 0% performance as follows:</p>
<p>100% = 100% payment<br />90% = -10% disincentive against monthly invoice<br />80% = -20% disincentive against monthly invoice<br />0% = No payment will be made until issues are satisfactorily resolved.  Retroactive payments will not be made.</p>
<p>1.9.2.1 Requirements Summary</p>
<p>Performance measures will be used to assess the vendor's performance under each task which is awarded against the resultant CLIN in the award in order to determine whether the vendor is performing at expected levels in order to allow for 100% payment.</p>
<p>The government will make objective and subjective assessments of the vendor's performance to determine whether contract performance is acceptable.  The vendor is expected to perform all functions in a professional manner and prepare accurate and timely documentation.  Progress will be tracked based on the milestone event when the vendor receives a specific tasking.  Performance may vary with the complexity of the acquisition or technical document.   It is expected that the documentation and procedures will comply with all major regulatory and process requirements and agency policies and procedures.</p>
<p>1.9.2.2 Method of Surveillance</p>
<p>The method of surveillance that the government will use to ensure quality assurance and timeliness of all tasks may include, but not be limited to any of the following: random sampling, 100% inspection, and customer feedback.  The government will inspect and evaluate performance of each completed task or deliverable required in the PWS.</p>

It shall be the responsibility of the prime Contractor to return such identification to the issuing agency in accordance with the terms set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.<br />2.10   DLAD 52.204-9000 Contractor Personnel Security Requirements (JUL 2015)<br />(a) Work to be performed under this contract or task order may, in full or in part, be performed at the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Headquarters (HQ), DLA field activity office(s), or other Federally-controlled facilities. Prior to beginning work on a contract, DLA requires all Contractor personnel working on the Federally-controlled facility to have, at a minimum, an initiated National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or NACI equivalent and favorable completion of a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) fingerprint check. <br />(b) Additionally, in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Programs, and DLA Issuance 4314, Personnel Security Program, all DoD Contractor personnel who have access to Federally-controlled information systems must be assigned to positions which are designated at one of three information technology (IT) levels, each requiring a certain level of investigation and clearance, as follows: <br />(1) IT-I for an IT position requiring a single scope background investigation (SSBI) or SSBI equivalent; <br />(2) IT-II for an IT position requiring a National Agency check with Law and Credit (NACLC) or NACLC equivalent; and <br />(3) IT-III for an IT position requiring a NACI or equivalent.<br />Note: IT levels will be designated according to the criteria in DoD 5200.2-R.<br />(c) Previously completed security investigations may be accepted by the Government in lieu of new investigations if determined by the DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office to be essentially equivalent in scope to the contract requirements. The length of time elapsed since the previous investigation will also be considered in determining whether a new investigation is warranted. To assist the Government in making this determination, the Contractor must provide the following information to the respective DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office immediately upon receipt of the contract. This information must be provided for each Contractor employee who will perform work on a Federally-controlled facility and/or will require access to Federally-controlled information systems: <br />(1) Full name, with middle name, as applicable, with social security number; <br />(2) Citizenship status with date and place of birth; <br />(3) Proof of the individual's favorably adjudicated background investigation or NACI, consisting of identification of the type of investigation performed, date of the favorable adjudication, name of the agency that made the favorable adjudication, and name of the agency that performed the investigation;<br />(4) Company name, address, phone and fax numbers with email address; <br />(5) Location of on-site workstation or phone number if off-site (if known by the time of award); and<br />(6) Delivery order or contract number and expiration date; and name of the Contracting Officer. <br />(d) The Contracting Officer will ensure that the Contractor is notified as soon as a determination is made by the assigned or cognizant DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office regarding acceptance of the previous investigation and clearance level. <br />(1) If a new investigation is deemed necessary, the Contractor and Contracting Officer will be notified by the respective DLA Personnel Security Office after appropriate checks in DoD databases have been made. <br />(2) If the Contractor employee requires access to classified information and currently does not have the appropriate clearance level and/or an active security clearance, the DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office will relay this information to the Contractor and Contracting Officer for further action. Investigations for Contractor employees requiring access to classified information must be initiated by the Contractor Facility Security Officer (FSO).<br />(3) The Contracting Officer will ensure that the respective DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office initiates investigations for Contractor employees not requiring access to classified information (i.e., IT or unescorted entry). <br />(4) It is the Contractor's responsibility to ensure that adequate information is provided and that each Contractor employee completes the appropriate paperwork, as required either by the Contracting Officer or the DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office, in order to begin the investigation process for the required clearance level. <br />(e) The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that each Contractor employee assigned to the position has the appropriate security clearance level. <br />(f) The Contractor shall submit each request for IT access and investigation through the Contracting Officer to the assigned or cognizant DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office. Requests shall include the following information and/or documentation: <br />(1) Standard Form (SF) 85, Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, or the SF 86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions (see note below);<br />(2) Proof of citizenship (i.e., an original or a certified copy of a birth certificate, passport, or naturalization certificate); and <br />(3) Form FD-258, Fingerprint Card (however, fingerprinting can be performed by the cognizant DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office).<br />(Note to (f)(1) above: An investigation request is facilitated through use of the SF 85 or the SF 86. These forms with instructions as well as the Optional Form (OF) 306, Declaration for Federal Employment, which is required with submission of the SF85 or SF 86, are available at the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) system called Electronic -Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). Hard copies of the SF85 and SF86 are available at OPM's web-site, www.opm.gov, but hard copies of the forms are not accepted.)<br />(g) Required documentation, listed above in paragraphs (f) (1) through (3), must be provided by the Contractor as directed by the Contracting Officer to the cognizant DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office at the time of fingerprinting or prior to the DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office releasing the investigation to OPM. <br />(h) Upon completion of the NACI, NACLC, SSBI, or other sufficient, appropriate investigation, the results of the investigation will be forwarded by OPM to the appropriate adjudication facility for eligibility determination or the DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office for review and determination regarding the applicant's suitability to occupy an unescorted entry position in performance of the DLA contract. Contractor personnel shall not commence work on this effort until the investigation has been favorably adjudicated or the Contractor employee has been waived into the position pending completion of adjudication. The DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office will ensure that results of investigations will be sent by OPM t to the Department of Defense, Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) or DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office.<br />(i) A waiver for IT level positions to allow assignment of an individual Contractor employee to commence work prior to completion of the investigation may be granted in emergency situations when it is determined that a delay would be harmful to national security. A request for waiver will be considered only after the Government is in receipt of the individual Contractor employee's completed forms, the background investigation has been initiated and favorable FBI fingerprint check has been conducted. The request for a waiver must be approved by the Commander/Director or Deputy Commander/Director of the site. The cognizant DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office reserves the right to determine whether a waiver request will be forwarded for processing. The individual Contractor employee for which the waiver is being requested may not be assigned to a position, that is, physically work at the Federally-controlled facility and/or be granted access to Federally-controlled information systems, until the waiver has been approved.<br />(j) The requirements of this clause apply to the prime Contractor and any subcontractors the prime Contractor may employ during the course of this contract, as well as any temporary employees that may be hired by the Contractor. The Government retains the right to request removal of Contractor personnel, regardless of prior clearance or adjudication status whose actions, while assigned to this contract, who are determined by the Contracting Officer to conflict with the interests of the Government. If such removal occurs, the Contractor shall assign qualified personnel, with the required investigation, to any vacancy.<br />(k) All Contractor personnel who are granted access to Government and/or Federally-controlled information systems shall observe all local automated information system (AIS) security policies and procedures. Violations of local AIS security policy, such as password sharing, performing personal work, file access violations, or browsing files outside the scope of the contract, will result in removal of the Contractor employee from Government property and referral to the Contractor for appropriate disciplinary action. Actions taken by the Contractor in response to a violation will be evaluated and will be reflected in the Contractor's performance assessment for use in making future source selection decisions. In addition, based on the nature and extent of any violations of AIS security policy, the Government will consider whether it needs to pursue any other actions under the contract such as a possible termination. <br />(l) The Contractor may also be required to obtain a Common Access Card (CAC) or Installation Access Badge for each Contractor employee in accordance with procedures established by DLA. When a CAC is required, the Contracting Officer will ensure that the Contractor follows the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 and any other CAC-related requirements in the contract. The Contractor shall provide, on a monthly basis, a listing of all personnel working under the contract that have CACs.<br />(m) Contractor personnel must additionally receive operations security (OPSEC) and information security (INFOSEC) awareness training. The DLA annual OPSEC refresher training and DLA annual INFOSEC training will satisfy these requirements and are available through the DLA Intelligence Office.<br />(n) When a Contractor employee who has been granted a clearance is removed from the contract, the Contractor shall provide an appropriately trained substitute who has met or will meet the investigative requirements of this clause. The substitute may not begin work on the contract without written documentation, signed by the Contracting Officer, stating that the new Contractor employee has met one of the criteria set forth in paragraphs (c), (d), or (i) of this clause, (i.e., acceptance of a previously completed security investigation, satisfactory completion of a new investigation, or a waiver allowing work to begin pending completion of an investigation). Contractor individual employees removed from this contract as a result of a violation of local AIS security policy are removed for the duration of the contract. <br />(o) The following shall be completed for every employee of the Government Contractor working on this contract upon contract expiration. Additionally, the Contractor shall notify the contracting officer immediately in writing whenever a Contractor employee working on this contract resigns, is reassigned, is terminated or no longer requires admittance to the Federally-controlled facility or access to Federally-controlled information systems. When the Contractor employee departs, the Contractor will relay departure information to the cognizant DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office and the Trusted Agent (TA) that entered the individual into the Trusted Associated Sponsorship System (TASS), so appropriate databases can be updated. The Contractor will ensure each departed employee has completed the DLA J6 Out-Processing Checklist, when applicable, for the necessary security briefing, has returned any Government-furnished equipment, returned the DoD CAC and DLA (or equivalent Installation) badge, returned any DoD or DLA vehicle decal, and requested deletion of local area network account with a prepared Department of Defense (DD) Form 2875. The Contractor will be responsible for any costs involved for failure to complete the out-processing, including recovery of Government property and investigation involved.<br />(p) These Contractor security requirements do not excuse the Contractor from meeting the delivery schedule/performance requirements set forth in the contract, or waive the delivery schedule/performance requirements in any way. The Contractor shall meet the required delivery schedule/performance requirements unless the contracting officer grants a waiver or extension. <br />(q) The Contractor shall not bill for personnel, who are not working on the contract while that Contractor employee's clearance investigation is pending. <br />SECTION 3: CLAUSES</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (May 2014) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause.<br />(a) Inspection/Acceptance. <br />(1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.<br />(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.<br />(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.]<br />(5) <br />(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may-<br />(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or<br />(B) Terminate this contract for cause.<br />(ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract.<br />(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to--<br />(i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or<br />(ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.<br />(7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract.<br />(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.<br />(9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.

The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: [Insert each element of other direct costs (e.g., travel, computer usage charges, etc. Insert "None" if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided. If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert &lsquo;None'."]<br />(2) Indirect Costs (Material handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert "$0" if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert &lsquo;None'."]<br />(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.<br />(3) Ceiling price.

When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.<br />(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer):<br />(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice met the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract.<br />(ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment-<br />(A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic);<br />(B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures;<br />(C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and<br />(D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices.<br />(iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost-<br />(A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and<br />(B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices.<br />(5) Overpayments/Underpayments.

The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.<br />(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon written request, with adequate assurances of future performance.

Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this clause, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. In the event of termination for cause, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.</p>

However, the Government may use information other than that provided by the offeror in its evaluation, including market research. Proposal information provided for one factor may be used to assess other factors if the Government deems it appropriate.</p>
<p>j.	The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unreasonable in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unreasonably high or low in cost (however cost realism will not be done) when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of technical competence or a failure to comprehend the complexity and performance requirements of the program.</p>
<p>k.	The Government reserves the right to verify any information presented in the Non-Price and Price Proposals.</p>
<p>l.	All contractors are encouraged to utilize the SBA PRONet and SUBNet programs to assist them in obtaining resources to meet the subcontract requirements.</p>

<p>i.	Technical Approach</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's knowledge of the functional and technical expertise of Information Technology End User Support. The Government will evaluate the offeror's understanding of the top-to-bottom approach (e.g. business functionalities/capabilities) that is required for the operational ability of information systems and applications.

<p><br />2.  PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The information required in this volume shall be presented in the format provided in Enclosure 1 entitled "Past Performance Template."  Information for a minimum of two (maximum of 3) projects shall be provided. The offeror shall demonstrate its experience and expertise in providing services similar to End User IT Support. The offeror shall, at a minimum, provide:</p>
<p>a)	A list of 2-3 contracts that the offeror held in the past three years, in which the services of similar scope and complexity were performed. A maximum of 3 referenced contracts with a point of contact information (i.e. phone number and e-mail address) shall be included.</p>
<p>b)	A summary description of the task requirements of each referenced contract.  Reference the similarities of these tasks to those requirements referenced in the PWS.</p>
<p>c)	The total dollar value of each contract referenced.</p>
<p>The Offeror must ensure that information presented for contact points is accurate and current (i.e., current phone numbers, titles, etc.).  The Government will not attempt to "track down" reference data in cases where inaccurate data is presented</p>
<p>i.	 Past Performance Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>The Government will contact the points of contact provided by the offeror each project submitted in accordance with the Past Performance Template. Responses received from the points of contact will be used as part of this evaluation process. Evaluation will not necessarily be based only on this information.  Offerors are advised that the Government may use information gained from any source known to the Government (i.e. the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS)) to evaluate past performance, provided such information is recent (within the past 3 years).</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. A past performance questionnaire will be utilized to contact references and rate proposals.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's experience and expertise in providing services similar to Information Technology End User Support, to include the overall DoD initiative to provide a common set of tools and services to support information systems throughout the DoD.  End User Support services are essential to many critical systems involving complex and unique setups that require detailed planning and involvement from supported systems. Priority is to ensure continued stable, accurate and reliable service to all current customers.</p>
<p>There are two aspects to this evaluation: 1) the determination of relevance of other contracts performed to the requirements of the solicitation and 2) a determination of how well the offeror performed on these contracts.  These two aspects, when combined, will result in the offeror's performance confidence assessment rating.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS FOR VOLUME II - PRICE FACTORS:</p>
<p><br />PRICING</p>
<p>The price proposals will be evaluated for total price proposed from each offeror. The Pricing Team plans to determine pricing fair and reasonable based on competition in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(i). In addition to competition, in order to ensure a fair and reasonable price, the Pricing Team may use other available price analysis techniques in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b)(2), such as:</p>
<p>-	Comparison of proposed prices to historical prices paid<br />-	Comparison of proposed prices with Independent Government Cost Estimates<br />-	Comparison of proposed prices with prices obtained from market research for the same or similar items</p>
<p>The offerors' proposed labor mix and level of effort will be evaluated for reasonableness.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract to the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Offer.</p>

<DESC>1. This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as RFQ NNK17599306Q for a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for appraisal services to support the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-94. This requirement is a total small business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 531320, Offices of Real Estate Appraisers, with a size standard of $7.5 million.
<p>The Contractor shall appraise properties described in individual call orders (e.g. .parcels of vacant land, buildable land, easements, facilities, etc.). The Contractor shall make a detailed field inspection and identification of the various items of the property and shall make such investigations and studies as are appropriate and necessary to enable the Contractor to derive sound conclusions and to prepare the appraisal reports to be furnished under this contract. Upon completion of the inspections, investigations, and studies, the Contractor shall prepare, furnish, and deliver to the Government an appraisal reports in four copies covering said property.</p>
<p>The report shall, in form and substance, conform to the requirements for a complete, self-contained appraisal report as set forth by the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP); shall present adequate factual data to support each rate, percentage, or amount used in sufficient detail to permit an intelligent review of the appraisal report; shall relate conclusions to those facts; and shall, among other things, include the items set forth in Special Requirements and individual task orders. A professional, independent appraiser will review prior to acceptance.</p>
<p>2. The period of performance shall consist of a 2-year base, 2-year option 1, and 1-year option 2. NASA estimates that ten (10) call orders will be issued each year. Appraisals under this BPA will vary in price and complexity, although the attached Statement of Work (SOW) (Attachment 1) is representative of potential appraisals to be completed under this BPA. For evaluation purposes, Offerors shall provide a firm fixed price for the appraisal as stated in Attachment 1. NASA will utilize the proposed price and government estimated quantity of call orders per year to establish the maximum value of the BPA. Future call orders under the BPA will be issued based on quotes received in response to the specific appraisal requirements.</p>
<p>In addition, Offerors shall provide a descriptive narrative and/or evidence of:</p>
<p>- A minimum of 10 years of experience as certified property appraiser in State of Florida, to include proper accreditations such as general state certification, knowledge of residential and industrial property appraising practices.<br />- Experience demonstrating the appraisal of large, complex, and government owned properties, such as airports, seaports, industrial parks, etc. Experience demonstrating the appraisal of NASA property and Air Force property, KSC and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) specifically. Demonstrate knowledge and experience in market trends for Central Florida (Brevard, Seminole, Orange, Osceola and Volusia Counties).</p>
<p>3. Evaluation Factors and Basis for Award Determination</p>
<p>a. Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government using a lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) evaluation process. After receipt of proposals, the Government will first evaluate the lowest price proposal. If the lowest price proposal is determined to be technically acceptable and otherwise properly awardable, no further evaluations will be conducted, and award will be made. If, however, the lowest price proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable and/or otherwise not properly awardable, evaluations of the next lowest proposal will be evaluated as stated above.</p>
<p>b. The Offerors descriptive narrative will be evaluated to determine technical acceptability. Failure to address and provide evidence of the above elements of technical acceptability may result in the Government determining the proposal as non-responsive. Offerors that meet the following minimum qualifications will be determined technically acceptable:</p>
<p>- The Offeror shall have 10 years of experience as certified property appraiser in State of Florida, maintain proper accreditations such as general state certification, knowledge of residential and industrial property appraising practices.<br />- The Offeror shall demonstrate experience appraising large, complex, and government owned properties, such as airports, seaports, industrial parks, etc. Experience appraising NASA property and Air Force property, KSC and CCAFS specifically. Knowledge and experience in market trends for Central Florida (Brevard, Seminole, Orange, Osceola and Volusia Counties).</p>
<p><br />c. NASA will evaluate the Offerors price quote for the attached SOW to determine the lowest priced Offeror. The quote shall be inclusive of all associated cost elements, to include travel, materials, and other direct cost (ODC). NASA will use the price quote for this sample task to determine the Offeror's total evaluated price. The sample task is provided for price evaluation purposes and issuance of the first call order. NASA will obligate funding for this sample task after award of the BPA.</p>
<p>4. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a BPA without discussions with offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions or seek clarifications if the Contracting Officer (CO) determines they are necessary. In the event issues pertaining to a proposed task cannot be resolved to the CO's satisfaction, the Government reserves the right to withdraw and cancel the proposed BPA. In such an event, offerors will be notified in writing.</p>
<p>5. Applicable Provisions and Clauses are in Attachment 3.</p>
<p>6. Questions should be addressed to daniel.j.heggen@nasa.gov. Telephone questions will not be accepted. Please provide any questions, in writing, no later than January 9, 2017 at 11:00 AM (ET). The Government reserves the right to not answer questions submitted after this time. Reference number NNK17599306Q should be included in the subject line.</p>
<p>7. Proposals are due no later than January 16, 2017 at 11:00 AM (ET) and should be submitted to the NASA Contract Specialist via the following email address: daniel.j.heggen@nasa.gov.

<CONTACT>Jonathan M. Lear, Contracting Officer, Email john.lear@nih.gov
<DESC>Background Description: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has a medical imaging research program, which encompasses acquisition, reconstruction, post-processing, and clinical application of X-ray, CT, and MRI. As part of this broad program, several open source software packages are being developed and maintained by NHLBI scientists. Specifically, the Laboratory of Imaging Technology (LIT), under the leadership of Dr. Michael S. Hansen, is the driving force behind the ISMRM Raw Data (ISMRMRD) format (https://ismrmrd.github.io), which is the community standard for representation and storage of MRI raw data. This data format is used in a variety of image reconstruction and processing tools. The LIT is also actively developing and distributing an open source image reconstruction framework known as the Gadgetron (https://gadgetron.github.io). This framework includes a streaming pipeline architecture for efficient data processing and a set of toolboxes that provide image reconstruction components such as filters, transformations, and optimizers. In addition to these major software projects, the LIT also maintains various tools for integration with proprietary medical imaging instruments.
<p>As these tools grow in scope and popularity, there is a need for continuous restructuring and enhancement of the software packages. The introduction of enhancements must be done with a view to both current and future applications that need to be supported.</p>
<p>The NHLBI seeks a contractor to carry out key enhancements of the ISMRMRD format that are needed to accommodate new data types and formalize and define certain work flows. A contractor is also needed to implement enhancements in the Gadgetron framework to modernize some older sections of code and to accommodate the changes implemented in the ISMRMRD format.</p>
<p>(i)	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(ii)	The solicitation number is NHLBI-CSB-HL-2017-013-JML and the solicitation is issued as a request for quote (RFQ).</p>
<p>(iii)	The solicitation document, the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-92-1 effective December 19, 2016.</p>
<p>(iv)	 The associated NAICS code is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services, and the small business size standard is $27.5M.  The acquisition is being conducted in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.5.</p>
<p>(v)	Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>See attached Statement of Work (SOW) for Contractor Requirements.</p>
<p>(vi)	Period of Performance:</p>
<p>The period of performance of this contract is estimated to be two (2) years from the date of contract award. This will consist of one (1) base year and one (1) option year.</p>
<p>(vii)	The provision at FAR clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(viii)	The provision at FAR clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is applicable.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Contract award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer, in conforming to this RFQ, provides the overall best value to the Government, technical, past performance, and cost evaluation factors considered.  The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable cost.  Technical and Past Performance evaluation factors are more important than cost.  Total points: 100</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS FOR OFFEORS</p>
<p>1.	Development Model</p>
<p>The work outlined in the statement of work (SOW) consists of multiple interlinked components with varying levels of complexity. It is likely that the implementation of some of the tasks will lead to adjustments in requirements for other tasks. Consequently, the offeror is expected to propose a development model that allows for flexible adjustments to requirements through feedback and discussion. This development model should be defined in terms of time scale on which work package requirements might be adjusted along with descriptions of how such adjustments will be made in collaboration with the NHLBI.</p>
<p>2.	Time Frame</p>
<p>The work outlined in the SOW will likely take more than one year to complete. The offeror, therefore, is expected to include time estimates for each task (and subtask) of the SOW. It is understood that these estimates will change as the project progresses and adjustments (see above) are made, but initial (tentative) estimates of work effort and time lines are expected.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>1.	Mandatory Criteria:</p>
<p>The contractor must have documented experience with the following areas:</p>
<p>&bull;	C/C++ software for signal processing.<br />&bull;	Medical imaging software.<br />&bull;	Open source software development.<br />&bull;	Development of software used in scientific research.</p>
<p>2.	Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>The following criteria will be used to assess the proposals from contractors who meet the mandatory criteria:</p>
<p>Criterion 1. Development Model (40 points)</p>
<p>This project goals and work packages are likely to be adjusted and updated as the project progresses. Consequently, it is critically important that the proposed development model, including the interaction with the NHLBI, allows for changes while providing a rigorous framework that ensures steady progress.</p>
<p>Criterion 2. Signal processing software experience (40 points)</p>
<p>The purpose of the ISMRMRD and Gadgetron projects is to provide pipelines for raw data signal processing. While it is not required for the contractor to be an MRI reconstruction expert, it is critically important that the contractor team has a deep understanding of signal processing and the numerical libraries (BLAS, LAPACK, etc.) that are used for such software. Significant portions of the code are written for the GPU (CUDA) and weight will be given to proposals that include a team with expertise in implementation of optimization code in both regular C++ and C++ for the GPU (e.g., CUDA).</p>
<p>Criterion 3. Past performance and proposed personnel (20 points)</p>
<p>The proposal will also be evaluated based on the contractors past performance on projects that implement scientific algorithms in general and image reconstruction and/or post processing in particular. The contractor is expected to list examples of experience in this area including the experience of proposed key personnel.<br /> <br />(ix)	FAR clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, is applicable.  An offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically via http://www.acquisition.gov. If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the System for Award Management (SAM) website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (p) of this provision.<br /> <br />(x)	FAR clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xi)	FAR clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  Including the following clauses and Prohibitions:</p>

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. <BR> <BR>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>(a) An agency protest may be filed with either: (1) The contracting officer, or (2) at a level above the contracting officer, with the appropriate agency Protest Decision Authority. See 64 FR 16,651 (April 6, 1999). (b) Agency protests filed with the Contracting Officer shall be sent to the following address: [Insert Contracting Officer name and Address] (c) Agency protests filed with the agency Protest Decision Authority shall be sent to the following address: [Insert appropriate Protest Decision Authority name and Address] (d) A complete copy of all agency protests, including all attachments, shall be served upon the Contract Law Division of the Office of the General Counsel within one day of filing a protest with either the Contracting Officer or the Protest Decision Authority.

Hoover Building, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. FAX: (202) 482-5858. <BR> <BR>(a) A protest may be filed with either the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or the Court of Federal Claims unless an agency protest has been filed. (b) A complete copy of all GAO or Court of Federal Claims protests, including all attachments, shall be served upon (i) the Contracting Officer, and (ii) the Contract Law Division of the Office of the General Counsel, within one day of filing a protest with either GAO or the Court of Federal Claims. (c) Service upon the Contract Law Division shall be made as follows: U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, Chief, Contract Law Division, Room 5893, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. FAX: (202) 482-5858. <BR> <BR>(a) Investigative Requirements for High and Moderate Risk Contracts. All contractor (and subcontractor) personnel proposed to be employed under a High or Moderate Risk contract shall undergo security processing by the Department's Office of Security before being eligible to work on the premises of any Department of Commerce owned, leased, or controlled facility in the United States or overseas, or to obtain access to a Department of Commerce IT system. All Department of Commerce security processing pertinent to this contract will be conducted at no cost to the contractor. The level of contract risk will determine the type and scope of such processing, as noted below. (1) Investigative requirements for Non-IT Service Contracts are: (i) High Risk?Background Investigation (BI). (ii) Moderate Risk?Moderate Background Investigation (MBI). (2) Investigative requirements for IT Service Contracts are: (i) High Risk IT?Background Investigation (BI). (ii) Moderate Risk IT?Background Investigation (BI). (b) In addition to the investigations noted above, non-U.S. citizens must have a pre-appointment check that includes an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency check. (c) Additional Requirements for Foreign Nationals (Non-U.S. Citizens). To be employed under this contract within the United States, non-U.S. citizens must have: (1) Official legal status in the United States; (2) Continuously resided in the United States for the last two years; and (3) Obtained advance approval from the servicing Security Officer of the contracting operating unit in consultation with the DOC Office of Security (OSY) headquarters. (OSY routinely consults with appropriate agencies regarding the use of non-U.S. citizens on contracts and can provide up-to-date information concerning this matter.) <BR> <BR>(d) Security Processing Requirement. Processing requirements for High and Moderate Risk Contracts are as follows: (1) The contractor must complete and submit the following forms to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR): (i) Standard Form 85P (SF-85P), Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions; (ii) FD-258, Fingerprint Chart with OPM's designation in the ORI Block; and (iii) Credit Release Authorization. (2) The Sponsor will ensure that these forms have been properly completed, initiate the CD-254, Contract Security Classification Specification, and forward the documents to the cognizant Security Officer. (3) Upon completion of security processing, the Office of Security, through the servicing Security Officer and the Sponsor, will notify the contractor in writing of an individual's eligibility to be provided access to a Department of Commerce facility or Department of Commerce IT system. (4) Security processing shall consist of limited personal background inquiries pertaining to verification of name, physical description, marital status, present and former residences, education, employment history, criminal record, personal references, medical fitness, fingerprint classification, and other pertinent information. For non-U.S. citizens, the Sponsor must request an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency check. It is the option of the Office of Security to repeat the security processing on any contract employee at its discretion. (e) Notification of Disqualifying Information. If the Office of Security receives disqualifying information on a contract employee, the COR will be notified. The Sponsor, in coordination with the Contracting Officer, will immediately remove the contract employee from duties requiring access to Departmental facilities or IT systems. Contract employees may be barred from working on the premises of a facility for any of the following: (1) Conviction of a felony crime of violence or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; (2) Falsification of information entered on security screening forms or on other documents submitted to the Department; (3) Improper conduct once performing on the contract, including criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct or other conduct prejudicial to the Government, regardless of whether the conduct was directly related to the contract; (4) Any behavior judged to pose a potential threat to Departmental information systems, personnel, property, or other assets. (f) Failure to comply with security processing requirements may result in termination of the contract or removal of contract employees from Department of Commerce facilities or denial of access to IT systems. (g) Access to National Security Information. Compliance with these requirements shall not be construed as providing a contract employee clearance to have access to national security information. (h) The contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts. <BR> <BR>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTING WITH ENTITIES THAT REQUIRE CERTAIN INTERNAL CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS?REPRESENTATION (FEB 2015) (a)	In accordance with section 743 of Division E, Title VII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Resolution Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub.

<DESC>Title:	Lead-based Paint Renovation Training Project for Region 5

Project Background  

The prevalence of childhood lead poisoning in the U.S. continues to present a problem, especially in underserved communities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 24 children (4.2 %) in America, in 2014, have elevated levels of lead in their blood greater than or equal to 5 micrograms per deciliter, largely because about 30 million American homes still contain lead-based paint, and those dwellings in disrepair are a major source of exposure.

The City of Chicago, Illinois, and other major metropolitan areas in Region 5 have some of the highest incident rates of elevated blood-lead levels in the country, higher than the national rate of lead poisoning. In addition, the current situation in Flint, Michigan, has created opportunity to implement solutions that can ultimately eliminate lead exposures.  

In 2008, EPA expanded its regulatory capacity through adoption and implementation of its Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) Rule to prevent and control exposures to lead-based paint and dust. Specifically, the RRP regulation requires contractors to be certified and trained in the use of lead-safe work practices when performing renovations in older (pre-1978) homes. EPA expects that implementing the lead-safe work practices required under the RRP regulation will help control and eliminate lead paint hazards, provide for lead-safe housing, and help eradicate this preventable childhood disease.

Training Objective  

The ultimate objective of the project is to decrease the number of children with elevated blood-lead levels in older housing stock in these cities and neighborhoods. To eliminate exposure to lead-based paint through proper renovation, there is a greater demand for certified RRP specialists. 

With this training, there will be an increase in the number of professionally certified renovators in Chicago and several other environmental justice communities in Region 5, and by using the skills learned during the training, renovators will be able to conduct renovation activities in a manner which results in less children and adults being exposed to lead-based paint hazards from the renovation activities. This training will also help provide local residents with knowledge and skills for meaningful employment.

Scope of Work

1)  A contractor, an EPA-accredited trainer (hereinafter referred to as trainer), will conduct at least five training classes on EPAs Renovation, Repair, and Painting Rule (RRP).  At least one training class will be located in environmental justice communities in each following five Region 5 cities: Chicago, IL, Gary, IN, Detroit, MI, Flint, MI, and Cleveland, OH.  In addition, consideration will be given to having a class in a Spanish speaking community, presented in Spanish, in one of the cities depending on the city and/or community organization needs.

2)  The trainer is responsible for providing and/or using the facility, advertising, EPA Model training materials, certified instructor(s), and training certificate/registration, and complying with applicable State and/or local requirements.

3)  The trainer must contact and work closely with the local county, city, and community organizations to announce the training and secure a local community facility for the training. The announcements for the training will be conducted with a preference for residents and workers in the communities in which the training is taking place, and will include the following statement:  This training is being funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5 Office in Chicago, Illinois.

4)  The trainer must meet with EPA prior to initiating the project and submit a progress report to EPA every two weeks, by email. 

5)  The trainer must also follow-up with the students or the local county, city, and/or community organizations after completion of the training to identify if students were able to secure any jobs with the new RRP training and certifications.  This must be done within one month from the date that the training was conducted.

6)  The trainer will train 125 students under this contract. The trainer will seek to have average class sizes of 25 students in the 5 communities.

7)  The training will be free for the 125 students trained under this contract.  The funds under this contract will be used to cover the students training and certification, in addition to covering the provisions identified in the preceding paragraph.

8)  The training will include, but is not limited to background information on the hazards of lead contamination; the need for lead safe work practices; site preparation; proper handling and disposal of the material; HUD and OSHA requirements; administration of paperwork; testing; and other city, state, and federal requirements. Upon successful completion of the training, trainees will receive certification under the RRP from the trainer.

9)  All of the training classes will be conducted by August 31, 2017, with completion of the project, including the follow-up with the students or local county, city, and/or community organization, as specified in item 5, above, by September 30, 2017.

10) The training must be conducted by the recipient of this contract, and cannot be sub-contracted to another trainer.

Trainer Information

Trainers for this project (also considered contractors for the purpose of this project) will be selected from a list of training providers that have been accredited (approved) by Region 5 with the following conditions.  The trainers must be accredited to provide training on the RRP, have a sufficient number of principal instructors, and be accredited to train at non-permanent facilities which are consistent with the site selection criteria in their approved application.  The selection of trainers for this project will be based on the quality of their proposals, technical knowledge, training experience, compliance history, and the bids.

Period of Performance and Completion Date  
 
All of the training classes will be conducted by August 31, 2017, with completion of the project, including the follow-up with the students or local county, city, and/or community organization, as specified in item 5, above, by September 30, 2017.

<DESC>SOLICITATION PHASE I.<br />The United States General Services Administration has a requirement for the selection of a contractor to perform Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services at the Weis Federal Courthouse in Pittsburgh, PA.  The work includes but is not limited to constructing the necessary shell and tenant improvements (TI) required for two new occupant agencies, namely the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  In addition, the contractor will be required to construct the necessary shell and TI for the forced relocation of approximately three existing tenant spaces.  Design will be based upon conceptual plans developed by MGA Partners Architects during a previously completed study.<br /> <br />This procurement will be advertised on the FedBizOpps (FBO) website (www.fbo.gov), and all interested offerors will be able to respond to the Request for Proposal (RFP) on an unrestricted basis.  The NAICS code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction).  The Small Business Size Standard is $36.5 million dollars.<br /> <br />Award will be a Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Guaranteed Maximum Price with Construction Contingency Allowance and Shared Savings contract.  The CMc contract is a variation on the fixed price incentive (successive targets) contract type found in FAR 16.403-2 tailored for construction.  The ceiling price is set at selection and award of the contract.  The adjusting profit requirement in FAR 16.403-2 is accomplished through the shared savings aspect of the contract.  And the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated RFP.  The approach to source selection for this procurement will be pursuant to the best value tradeoff concept as identified in FAR Part 15.101-1 and FAR Part 15.3.  It is the Government's intention to award a contract to the offeror whose proposal conforms to the RFP requirements and is considered to be most advantageous to the government, price, and technical factors considered.  Competitive proposals shall be evaluated and assessed based on the factors specified in this solicitation.  For this solicitation, the combined weight of the technical evaluation factors is significantly more important than price.
<p><br />This procurement will be advertised on the FedBizOpps (FBO) website, and will be completed in two phases.  The first phase includes technical evaluation only, and all interested firms will be able to respond to the RFP.  The technical factors for the first phase include:  Prior Experience, Past Performance on Relevant Projects, and Project Team Qualifications.  This phase will result in the development of an advisory short list. The Government will respond to the technical submissions with information on the likelihood that the offeror will be considered technically qualified.</p>
<p>The second phase will include a full technical evaluation (Project Management/Delivery Plan), a Base Bid proposal for the Demolition and Forced Relocation package, and a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) Option for the construction work based on a 35% design.  The GMP option price will be finalized at or before the 75% design milestone.  The option may also be exercised at this time.<br /> <br />The Solicitation (RFP) will only be available electronically. The solicitation (specifications, drawings, clauses and bid forms) can only be obtained through FedBizOpps. FedBizOpps is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition material. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation (specifications, drawings, clauses and bid forms) and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information. Potential offerors must register on the FedBizOpps website to have access to solicitation material.</p>
<p>PRICING INFORMATION IS NOT REQUIRED AT THIS TIME.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>

After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. Also, the full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this/these address(es):  http://www.acquisition.gov/far, http://www.doi.gov/pam, http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/2010-7967.htm <BR> <BR>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- (A) Are [  ] are not [  ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [  ] have not [  ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are [  ] are not [  ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and Cont... <BR> <BR>(D) Have [  ], have not [  ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [  ] has not [  ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. Cont... <BR> <BR>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>(a) Inspection/Acceptance. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights? (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item. (b) Assignment. The Contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3727). However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not assign its rights to receive payment under this contract. (c) Changes. Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties. (d) Disputes. This contract is subject to 41 U.S.C. chapter 71, Contract Disputes. Failure of the parties to this contract to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal or action arising under or relating to this contract shall be a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract. Cont... <BR> <BR>(e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. (f) Excusable delays. The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence. (g) Invoice. (1) The Contractor shall submit an original invoice and three copies (or electronic invoice, if authorized) to the address designated in the contract to receive invoices. An invoice must include? (i) Name and address of the Contractor; (ii) Invoice date and number; (iii) Contract number, contract line item number and, if applicable, the order number; (iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of the items delivered; (v) Shipping number and date of shipment, including the bill of lading number and weight of shipment if shipped on Government bill of lading; (vi) Terms of any discount for prompt payment offered; (vii) Name and address of official to whom payment is to be sent; (viii) Name, title, and phone number of person to notify in event of defective invoice; and (ix) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The Contractor shall include its TIN on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract. (x) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information. (A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract. (B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision, contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer?System for Award Management, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer?Other Than System for Award Management), or applicable agency procedures. (C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT. (2) Invoices will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR Part 1315. Cont... <BR> <BR>(h) Patent indemnity. The Contractor shall indemnify the Government and its officers, employees and agents against liability, including costs, for actual or alleged direct or contributory infringement of, or inducement to infringe, any United States or foreign patent, trademark or copyright, arising out of the performance of this contract, provided the Contractor is reasonably notified of such claims and proceedings. (i) Payment.? (1) Items accepted. Payment shall be made for items accepted by the Government that have been delivered to the delivery destinations set forth in this contract. (2) Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR Part 1315. (3) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause. (4) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date which appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. (5) Overpayments. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate contract financing or invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on a contract financing or invoice payment, the Contractor shall? (i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the?

In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose.

The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided. (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. Cont... <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. (u) Unauthorized Obligations (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor?s representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause. (a) Inspection/Acceptance. (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. (2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. (3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier. (4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5)(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may? <BR> <BR>(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or (B) Terminate this contract for cause. (ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to? (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor?s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor?s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. (8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. (9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.

The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer: Cont... <BR> <BR>(i) Hourly rate. (A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer. (C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative. (D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract. (E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. (1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated. (2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract. (3) If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer. Cont... <BR> <BR>(ii) Materials. (A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall not exceed the Contractor?s established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the? (1) Quantities being acquired; and (2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements. (B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor? (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor?s payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice. (C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall? (1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and (2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract. (D) Other Costs. Unless listed below, other direct and indirect costs will not be reimbursed. (1) Other Direct Costs. The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: [Insert each element of other direct costs (e.g., travel, computer usage charges, etc. Insert ?None? if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided. If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert ?Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert ?None?.?] (2) Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert ?$0? if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert ?Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert ?None?).?] Cont... <BR> <BR>(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. (3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. Cont... <BR> <BR>(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): (i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; (ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment? (A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic); (B) The Contractor?s timekeeping procedures; (C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and (D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices. (iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost? (A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and (B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. (5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor?s payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall? Cont... <BR> <BR>(i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the? (A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment); (B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable; (C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and (D) Contractor point of contact. (ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer. (6)(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in 41 U.S.C. 7109, which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid. (ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. (iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if? (A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner; (B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or (C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.607-2). Cont... <BR> <BR>(iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment. (v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates: (A) The date fixed under this contract. (B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination. (vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on? (A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor; (B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or (C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor. (vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract. (viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the ?completion invoice? and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion. Cont... <BR> <BR>(7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions. (i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor. (ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier. (iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents. Cont... <BR> <BR>(8) Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315. (9) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause. (10) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. (l) Termination for the Government?s convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor?s records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided. (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<DESC>This amendment corrects the period of performance from 1/02/17 - 1/01/21 to 1/02/17 through 1/01/22 and answers questions received.
<p>1. The solicitation and pricing documentation states that these services are for 5 years yet the period of performance only indicates 4 years (1/02/17 - 1/01/21). For it to be 5 years the period of performance would have to be 1/02/17 through 1/01/22. Please advise of the correct period of performance.</p>
<p>This amendment corrects the period of performance</p>
<p>2. The statement of work indicates that an update of the title commitment is going to be required yet there is no line item for this in the pricing structure. A line item needs to be added for this service.</p>
<p>Update should be included in the price for the preliminary title insurance commitment, with an understanding an update will be required</p>
<p>3. In Attachment 2 - Quote Submittal Worksheet - page 3 it states that NRCS will be awarding a single BPA to a contractor for this work. A BPA is an ordering agreement used for high volume calls and where multiple suppliers can provide the services. If a contractor is assigned a call order they can refuse it if they can't fit the work into their schedule. The government then moves to the next supplier for the services. It allows for price adjustments after the first 12 months of the BPA. It allows for the ability for the contractor to end the BPA at any point in time with 30 days written notice.</p>
<p>a. Is the government going to make one award or multiple awards for these services?</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>b. Will a contractor be able to refuse a call order?</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>c. Will a contractor be able to adjust their prices after the first 12 months if a price adjustment is needed?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>d. Why is the contractor being asked to bid five (5) separate years as Firm Fixed Prices under a BPA?</p>
<p>To allow for price adjustment</p>
<p>e. Will a contractor be able to terminate the BPA at any point with 30 days written notice to the government?</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>f. Where in the solicitation are the standard BPA clauses that would appear in a BPA contracting vehicle?</p>
<p>They can be found in the Combined Synopsis on pages 2 through 9</p>
<p><br />THE DUE DATE AND TIME REMAINS UNCHANGED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<a href="mailto:michelle.bailey@va.gov">VA119-17-Q-0017 Standard Manual Wheelchairs</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to address questions which have been submitted in response to this solicitation as follows;
Question 1: Since this is a competitive best value evaluation, will you add an additional evaluation factor to your RFQ for Socio-economic Status, and insert VA clauses provided by VAAR 815.304.71 (Solicitation provision and clause) which include 852.215.70, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-Owned Small Business Evaluation Factors and 852.215 71, Evaluation Factor Commitments. This will allow you to consider these standard VA best value socioeconomic criteria in your evaluation with whatever weighing you deem appropriate. 
Answer 1:  VAAR Clauses 815.304-70 Service Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-Owned Small Business Evaluation Factors and 852.215-71 Evaluation Factor Commitments have been added to this solicitation.
Question 2: On the pricing spreadsheet, Columns AS, AT, AU, AV call for specific prices for specific quantity ranges. May an offeror propose alternate price ranges since the current range is only up to 1500+ while the product requirements often significantly exceed that range. E.g. 5000-10000. This may allow better quantity discounts. 
Answer 2:  Prospective Contractors should feel free to provide pricing for items exceeding the 1500+ range, however no other changes to the pricing spreadsheet should be made.
Question 3: The RFQ (page 42) provides a sample methodology of how price ranges will be weighted and evaluated. The RFQ indicates the percentage weighting for a range will be specified by the Government. If an offeror elects to propose different ranges to provide better discounts, how will the Government adjust the weighing? An alternate example, where the target RFQ quantity is known, would help. 
Answer 3:  See answer 2 above.
Question 4: Given that no FSS is required to provide an offer, should the RFQ be amended to include 52.219-9? Without such a requirement, there is no method to ensure compliance with 52.219-8 which is already checked. 
Answer 4:  FAR Clause 52.219-9 Small Business Subcontracting Plan has been added to the solicitation under FAR Clause 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders.

The question period on this solicitation has closed; no further questions submitted will receive a response.

Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided.<br />(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.</p>

<p>(o) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in this contract.</p>

<p>(s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order:</p>
<p>(1) The schedule of supplies/services.<br />(2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts, and Unauthorized Obligations paragraphs of this clause.<br />(3) The clause at 52.212-5.<br />(4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.<br />(5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.<br />(6) Other paragraphs of this clause.<br />(7) The Standard Form 1449.<br />(8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments.<br />(9) The specification.</p>
<p>(t) System for Award Management (SAM).</p>
<p>(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(iii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.</p>
<p>(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:</p>
<p>(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.</p>
<p>(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>
<p>(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.</p>

<p>(3) As used in this clause, records include books, documents, accounting procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and regardless of form. This does not require the Contractor to create or maintain any record that the Contractor does not maintain in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to a provision of law.</p>

<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $4.27 per hour or $170.80 per week or $740.13 per month</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **</p>
<p>An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordnance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.<br /><br />All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1),<br />dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE<br />Standard Form 1444 (SF-1444)</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class (es) of employees (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iv)(C)(vi)). When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class (es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>
<p>This announcement is the solicitation which will result in a firm fixed-price contract.<br />Please send Quotes to CPT Richard Harvey by email at Richard.a.harvey5.mil@mail.com</p>

<DESC>PROJECT TITLE: NEXRAD Radar DC Servo Motors
<p>LOCATION OF WORK: Vendor's Facility</p>
<p>NAICS CODE: 335312, Motor and Generator Manufacturing. The small-business size standard is 1,250 employees.</p>
<p>SET-ASIDE STATUS: Small Business Set-Aside</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking sources capable of providing new DC Servo-motors to be used in the NEXRAD WSR-88D Antenna Positioning System that is a form, fit, function, replacement of the legacy DC Servo Motor, and is compatible with the existing servo amplifier and servo choke.</p>
<p>NEXRAD (Next-Generation Weather Radar) is a network of 168 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the National Weather Service (NWS), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Air Force (USAF). NEXRAD detects weather events and is the primary detection system used by the NWS to support issuance of severe weather warnings, and used by the FAA and USAF to support safety of flight operations. The WSR-88D Radar Operations Center (ROC) is responsible for complete life-cycle support of the radar network including system engineering, configuration management, and logistics analysis and support.</p>
<p>Each servo-motor is interchangeable between axis (Azimuth and Elevation) and shall be designed to accommodate this function and shall be in-field serviceable. NOAA is not seeking vendors to design, develop, and then produce this requirement; we are seeking vendors already capable of providing a working solution, as there are known sources of motors in the marketplace which meet all requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to meeting all requirements of the attached Vendor Item Drawing (VID), any product proposed to support this requirement shall not have proprietary limitations that restrict the future repair of the motor to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).</p>
<p>The contractor shall be capable of manufacturing and delivering up to 500 DC Servo Motors, P/N 2200220-201 or equivalent. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) was Electo-Mechanical Systems.</p>
<p>The salient characteristics of the DC Servo Motor are documented in the attached Vendor Item Drawing (VID), number 2200220-201. There are 3 sources for the DC Servo Motor documented in the VID as "suggested sources". These suggested sources have previously provided motors for test and evaluation for use in the WSR-88D NEXRAD radar that have demonstrated their ability to be compliant with all requirements. Any product that is proposed shall meet all requirements of the VID without significant modification. If a commercial product, other than those listed in the VID, meets all requirements, a sample will be requested to support Government inspection and testing in order to validate suitability of the product.</p>
<p>All dates listed below are tentative dates. Official dates will be provided when the solicitation is released.</p>

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic is seeking eligible Small Businesses, HUBZone Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, and Women-Owned Small Businesses capable of performing design-bid-build (DBB) construction services for project RM 7-01, Building 1029, at the Naval Foundry and Propeller Center, NAVSUPPACT Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania (DET Philadelphia Navy Yard (PNY) Annex, Philadelphia, PA.

The purpose of this project is to repair the existing electrical system in Building 1029 at the Naval Foundry and Propeller Center (NFPC), to provide a safe, environmentally controlled work area.
  Building 1029 is a 90,180 SF high bay industrial facility that was constructed in 1979.  It is the inside machine shop for the Naval Foundry and Propeller Center and is responsible for the milling of all sizes of propellers for surface ships and submarines.  Building 1029 equipment includes propeller profilers, PROMS (Propeller Robotic Optical Milling System), and various others milling machines, lathes, saws and grinders in support of the propeller manufacturing operations.  These large profilers can mill propellers up to 24 feet in diameter and require a controlled environment to maintain milling tolerances.  

This project will repair the existing HVAC system and the installation of Air Conditioning in the High Bay of Building 1029.
  These repairs, replacements and equipment additions will improve the workplace environment inside the machine shop of Building 1029 at the NFPC with improved heating and ventilation to support ship and submarine propeller manufacturing and shall meet the operational requirements of manufacturing propellers within the specified temperature range to maintain its critical tolerance level for the future profilers to be located in the central bays of Building 1029.  

This Project will also replace the low voltage 480V aluminum cables with copper wiring between the substation and various power panels.  In addition, all aluminum conductors from distribution panel boards to subpanels and associated transformers will be removed and replaced with copper conductors.
  New circuits will also be provided for the new equipment, and smoke detectors, with required fire alarm system interfacing in compliance with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) requirements.  

Lastly, this project scope will also include the removal of abandoned steam lines and asbestos-containing and other hazardous materials.

The work on this project must be performed in such a manner to prevent the equipment and operations housed within Building 1029 to not be visible when the replacement work is performed.  The Contractor must coordinate with the Naval Foundry  and  Propeller Center to establish a construction phasing and sequence of construction which will meet the user requirements for continued operation and result in the least amount of disruption to the propeller shop operations and in a manner which would allow the Contractor to complete the work to achieve these requirements.
  Due to the layout of the equipment within the building and continued operation of the existing cranes within the building, construction of scaffolding or work platforms within the building is not feasible.  

The building must remain operational during all work of this project due to the nature of the propeller shop activities, work schedule which must be maintained and 24/7 shift work hours.  Equipment will be allowed to be taken off-line for scheduled time frames as the work schedule/flow allows providing areas to allow overhead work to be performed.  This will result in work phasing requirements.  

A work phasing sequence plan shall be established in coordination with the user.  The Contractor will be required to follow this sequence of work indicated.
  The user, through the Contracting Officer Representative (COR), will be allowed to alter the sequence and direct the Contractor to work in a different area, based on scheduled equipment use.  

All use of Contractor supplied and utilized cranes, lifts, and booms must be coordinated with the COR, NAVFAC MIDLANT, and the Navy Crane center thru the COR.  Any use of cranes, lifts or booms within the building must be transparent to the operation of the building user operations.  The Contractor will not be allowed to utilize the existing bridge cranes within the building.

Building 1029 is a restricted entry building located at the Navy Yard, Philadelphia, PA.  Contractors must employ United States citizens and the Contractor must obtain CONFIDENTIAL Clearance for all personnel working in Building 1029.
  The company must first obtain clearance, and then all employees must obtain CONFIDENTIAL Clearance.

Contract Clause FAR 52.204-2, Security Requirements and Alternate II, FAC 5252.236-9301, Special Working Conditions and Entry to Work Area, applies.

Contractor personnel and other personnel associated with the Contractor in performing the work specified under this contract work must comply with the security requirements and classification of this procurement as indicated in Form DD 254.

  Other design and engineering services may be required to support various NSF projects.  Disciplines shall primarily include mechanical, electrical, fire protection and secondarily structural, architectural and civil review.  Mechanical work shall include commissioning. Personnel traveling to Antarctica must pass strict medical and dental examinations. If asbestos or hazardous materials exist, the Architect-Engineer (A-E) contractor shall identify and provide for their disposal in the required documents in accordance with applicable rules and regulations pertaining to such hazardous materials.

Evaluation and selection of the most highly qualified firm will be based on the following selection criteria, listed in descending order of importance: 

Criterion 1.
  Firms Specialized Experience: 

Firms recent specialized experience in the design, review, studies, construction surveillance, and inspection of relevant projects.  Relevant project involves heating, cogeneration, structural insulated panels (SIP), utilidors, and mechanical and electrical commissioning completed within the past five (5) years and in extremely remote, cold weather climate similar to Antarctica.  

Submission Requirements:  

SF330, Part I, Section F.  Submit a maximum of five (5) relevant projects, which best demonstrate the firms recent specialized experience in design, review, studies, construction surveillance, inspection services in relevant projects.  If more than five (5) projects are submitted, the Government will evaluate the first five (5) projects listed in Part I, Section F and disregard any other project information.

Each project shall include (1) project title; (2) location; (3) year completed; (4) project owner; (5) point-of-contact name, e-mail address, and phone number; (6) contract number or project identification number; (7) contract performance period; (8) contract award amount; (9) estimated construction cost; and (10) description of project and relevance to this solicitation.
  A project is defined as either a stand-alone contract or a single task order in an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  For IDIQs, the Government will not evaluate information provided for an IDIQ contract and will only evaluate individual task order information.  

The submission shall include a discussion of who executed the project as pertinent to demonstrating the firms specialized experience.  If a project was performed by a joint venture (JV), and all JV partners are not on the team proposed for this solicitation, the offeror should specifically address the work performed on the project submitted by the proposed JV partner(s).  If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the proposed JV partner(s), the project will be evaluated less favorably.
  Likewise, if the proposed JV partner(s) worked as a subcontractor on a project, the offeror should specifically address the work performed by the proposed JV partner(s) on the project submitted.  If a project does not provide requested data, accessible point-of-contact, or valid phone number, that project may be evaluated less favorably. Note: If the A-E firm is a JV, info should be submitted for projects performed by the JV; however, if there are no relevant projects performed by the JV, submit projects performed by the individual partner entities of the JV.  

A-E subconsultants specialized experience on a Design-Bid Build project will not be given the same level of consideration as the A-E prime contractors or JV partners.
  Specialized experience of an A-E subcontractor to a construction contractor, serving as the Designer-of-Record on a Design-Build project, will be given the same level of consideration as an A-E firms for a DBB project.   

Prime contractor-subcontractor/JVs/LLCs/LTDs with a demonstrated history of working together on prior projects will be considered more favorably than those without such history.  

Criterion 2.  Key Personnels Professional Qualifications, and Specialized Experience and Technical Competence:  

(a)	Professional Qualifications:  Professional qualifications of key personnel proposed.

SF330, Part I, Section E.  Specialized experience and technical competence shall be limited to the Principal in Charge of the prime A-E firm, Mechanical Project Engineer, Electrical Project Engineer, Fire Protection Project Engineer, Architect, Structural Engineer, Civil Engineer and Inspector.  Relevant project information for other key personnel is not required and if submitted, shall not be considered in the evaluation.  For these other key personnel, complete Blocks 12 through 18; and leave Block 19, Relevant Projects, blank. 

Submit a maximum of five (5) projects for each Principal in Charge of the prime A-E firm, Mechanical Project Engineer, Electrical Project Engineer, Fire Protection Project Engineer, Architect, Structural Engineer, Civil Engineer and Inspector, demonstrating specialized experience in relevant projects.
  A project is defined as either a stand-alone contract or a single task order in an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  If more than five (5) projects are submitted, the Government will evaluate the first five (5) projects listed in Part I, Section E and disregard any other project information. 

Each project shall include project title and location, year completed, brief description, point-of-contact name, e-mail address, phone number, contract number or project identification number, contract performance period, contract award amount, estimated construction cost, and the role and experience the Architect/Engineer had in performing the project.  Experience in a role other than Architect/Engineer for project submitted will not qualify as specialized experience and technical competence.
  If project description does not clearly define the role performed by the proposed Architect/Engineer or if a project does not provide the requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers, that project may be evaluated less favorably or as not qualified. 

Criterion 3.  Past Performance:  Firms will be evaluated on past performance on relevant projects with respect to work quality, compliance with schedules, cost control, and cooperation and responsiveness.  

Submission Requirements: 
 
SF330, Part I, Section H.  For each relevant project submitted for Criterion (1), Firms Specialized Experience, submit a DD2631, Performance Evaluation (Architect-Engineer) or Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR).
  If a DD2631 or CPAR is not available, provide a Performance Survey (download from NECO, https://www.neco.navy.mil) and submit the Survey with the SF330.  The Performance Survey shall be from the contracting agent and/or their representative responsible for the contract administration, or from the facility owner/user.  It shall not be from the prime contractor on a design-build project nor shall it be from a prime contractor to a sub-contractor. Past performance information not related to the projects described to meet Criterion (1) will not be considered.

The information provided in the SF330 may provide the major portion of the information used in the Governments evaluation for past performance.
  The Government however, is not restricted to the information provided by the Offeror and may use other sources to assess past performance information such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS), and inquiries with previous customers/owners.  PPIRS/ACASS will be evaluated for the firm that will perform the work and search will be based upon the DUNS number provided for the firm.  If the A-E received any less than satisfactory past performance evaluations from customers/owners, it is incumbent upon the A-E to provide an explanation of the rating and what the A-E has done or will do to preclude less than satisfactory ratings on future contracts.
  

Letters of commendation or awards are not required, and if submitted, shall not be considered in the evaluation.

A-E subconsultants past performance on a Design-Bid-Build project will not be given the same level of consideration as the A-E prime contractors or JV partners.  Past performance of an A-E subcontractor or subconsultant, serving as the prime A-E or Designer-of-Record on a Design-Build project, will be given the same level of consideration as an A-E firms for a DBB project.  However, past performance of an A-E subcontractor or subconsultant, serving as the prime A-E or Designer-of-Record on a DB project, shall be demonstrated by the submission of a Performance Survey, as described above, and not by the prime contractors Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) or Construction Contractor Appraisal Support System (CCASS) rating.
