<SUBJECT>Systems and Modular Furniture OEM Capability Briefing Request / Dealership RFI
<SOLNBR>FA8057-12-R-0001d
<RESPDATE>030212
<CONTACT>Joshua L Holbrook, Contract Officer, Phone (937) 257-0815, Email joshua.holbrook@wpafb.af.mil - James Boys, Supervisory Contract Negotiator, Phone 9372575684, Email james.boys@us.af.mil
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is comprised of two parts. The first part includes a request for an in-person capabilities brief from Systems and Modular Furniture Manufacturers. The second part includes a request for written responses from prospective Systems and Modular Dealers. Please review this RFI and pay careful attention to what is and is not being requested.<br /><br />Part I:<br />The Enterprise Sourcing Group's (ESG) Furnishings Commodities Council (FCC) hosted an Industry Day for draft RFP FA8057-12-R-0001 on 7 Feb 2012. A number of issues where raised by industry during that briefing that the FCC would like to further clarify with Industry. In order to facilitate this task, the ESG is offering Systems and Modular Furniture manufacturers an opportunity to provide an in-person capabilities briefing to the FCC during the period of 7 Mar 2012 through 14 Mar 2012. The briefings will be limited to 2 hours and will cover the following agenda items: <br /><br />Agenda:<br /><br />1. Please reaffirm your response to the systems and modular requirements RFI dated May 2011 posted on www.fbo.gov solicitation number RFI-03-2011-FCC. Confirm that you have a single product line per each product category (stackable, monolithic, modular, and demountable wall) that meet 100% of the requirements. For example, if you have three separate monolithic lines, we are looking for a product line that by itself that meets 100% of the requirements of RFP Attachment 2. If your product is unable to meet 100% of the requirements, please identify the specific requirement(s) that the product does not meet. <br /><br />2. Provide feedback on your ability to meet the reporting requirements (RFP attachment 12). In specific, identify each data field that you could not provide. <br />3. Provide feedback regarding the pricing methodology we are proposing to use to establish the average weighted discount for non-typical products and accessories (RFP attachment 10). Also, provide any comments you have about an Economic Price Adjustment clause in the solicitation. If you favor inclusion of an EPA, your recommendation should include a specific index for use in years 4 and 5 of the acquisition.<br />&nbsp;<br />4. Discuss the RFP response time of 30 days. In specific, if the FCC gave you more time how would you use it, how would it affect the quality of the proposal, and how would it benefit the government?<br /><br />5. Address any concerns about dealer financing. In specific, address the issue from industry day where dealers would be required to carry financing for orders under this effort and how you plan to alleviate this potential issue.<br /><br />6. Address any concerns you may have regarding the impact of the proposed use of typical configurations on existing software used by your dealerships.<br /><br />7. Discuss any experience you have with GSA packaged office and your concerns regarding the non-use of packaged office on this acquisition.<br /><br />8. Question and Answer session.<br /><br />If you decide to participate, please send a e-mail confirming your desire to meet, along with any scheduling preferences, to the name and address at the end of this request. We will determine the final schedule and provide a response back to your firm.
<p>Part II:<br />In addition to the OEM capabilities brief the FCC is requesting written feedback from prospective systems and modular furniture dealers regarding the following questions:<br /><br />1. A number of firms indicated that an Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) clause would alleviate risk when estimating prices over the five year period of performance. Would you favor the inclusion of an EPA clause in the final RFP? If so, which index would you suggest the Air Force use for adjusting prices in years 4 and 5 of the effort? Keep in mind that inclusion of an EPA clause might also result in decreasing NTE pricing over time, should the index decline or rise less than projected at time of contract award.</p>
<p>2. A number of dealers indicated that doing business directly with the Air Force would cause them to have substantial carrying costs that would imperil their financial situation. Please help us understand how a purchase order to a small business dealer backed by the full faith and credit of the Air Force is viewed as less secure than a purchase order provided directly to an OEM. In your response you may include how you would propose to remedy this potential problem using commercial contracting processes and our existing strategy.</p>
<p>3. It has been suggested by some that dealers earn little or no margin on OEM products. Do dealers earn profit/income on any of the OEM products they install in their region? If so, how does this work in the current manufacturer/dealer model?<br /><br />Deadline for written responses to Parts I and II of this RFI are 7 days from posting date (2 Mar 2012). Responses should be sent to Joshua.holbrook@wpafb.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>A summary of the BAA funding opportunity is provided below.  For a detailed description of this opportunity please see the attached solicitation file - DARPA-BAA-12-30 (C2M2L-2).  A virtual Proposers' Day will be held on March 7, 2012.  Please see the attached file - C2M2L-2 Proposers' Day Announcement for details.  This announcement represents the FINAL solicitation for the C2M2L-2 effort.
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>DARPA's Adaptive Vehicle Make (AVM) portfolio of programs is aimed at compressing at least five-fold the development timelines for new complex cyber-electro-mechanical systems such as military vehicles.  Under AVM, DARPA is pursuing the development of several elements of enabling infrastructure aimed at radically transforming the systems engineering/design/verification (META /META-II ), manufacturing (iFAB ), and innovation (vehicleforge.mil ) elements of the overall "make" process for delivering new defense systems or variants. Each of these infrastructure capabilities is largely generic, i.e., applicable to any cyber-electro-mechanical system.</p>
<p>In order to exercise these capabilities in the context of a relevant military system, DARPA intends to build FANG -the Fast, Adaptable, Next-Generation Ground Vehicle-a new heavy infantry fighting vehicle (IFV). FANG's functional requirements will mirror those for the Marine Corps' Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV). A series of three design challenges focused on subsystems of increasing complexity will ultimately result in the FANG vehicle being built in the iFAB Foundry.</p>
<p>The present Component, Context, and Manufacturing Model Library 2 (C2M2L-2, pronounced "camel 2") solicitation is for the second round of domain-specific models needed to enable the design, verification, and fabrication of the chassis and survivability subsystems of the FANG vehicle using the META, iFAB, and vehicleforge.mil infrastructure. (The first of these challenges is focused on the mobility and drivetrain subsystems, and is supported by the C2M2L-1  effort.) A subsequent C2M2L solicitation is expected to address all of the remaining subsystem domains needed to construct and verify a complete infantry fighting vehicle.</p>

<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen,</p>

<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC><strong>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /></strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Casting Padding <strong>on or about April 2, 2012,</strong> but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days.<br /><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <br />Examples of items being solicited could include, but are not limited to, cotton padding sterile and non-sterile 4 inches x 4 yards, cotton padding sterile and non-sterile 6 inches x 4 yards, cotton padding sterile and non-sterile 3 inches x 4 yards, cotton padding sterile and non-sterile 2 inches x 4 yards, and other items. The estimated value of the resultant Incentive Agreement (IA) will be approximately $280,986.53 annually. <br />NOTE: This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel and standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. To participate in this Standardization Action (SA) your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor, or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA and a separate commercial agreement with Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from the solicitation is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. <strong>Vendor must update their DAPA numbers for this product line in the DAPA Management System with the country from which each line item is an end product, IAW the Trade Agreements Act. Vendors responding to the solicitation will be required to ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country.<br /></strong>Detailed information about the requirements and selection process will be provided in the RFIAQ. The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the RFIAQ is imminent. Upon issuance of the RFIAQ, all solicitation information will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website. <br />

<DESC>The FHWA has an ongoing need for Information Technology Support Services to provide multi-faceted nationwide IT support to the FHWA Headquarters in Washington D.C. and over 60 field offices nationwide. This requirement is a re-compete of an existing contract, currently held by the INDUS Corporation under contract DTFH61-02-C-00001. It is intended that this re-competition for the IT services will be an 8(a) Small Business Set-Aside.
<p>The FHWA Information Technology Support Services (FITSS) requirement has been on-going since 1982 when the original contract was awarded for information technology support services. This mission-critical program is vital to the agency's success. These services are regularly used and relied upon by over 1,500 FHWA employees and contractors in Headquarters, as well as approximately 2,000 field site employees and contractors. There are also approximately 26,500 non-FHWA, state, and local users of impacted IT systems that are supported by FITSS, as well as general public access to FHWA websites.</p>
<p>This contract will procure non-personal Information Technology Support Services (ITSS) for the Information Technology Division (ITD) and its customers. The procurement includes program management services, design and improvement, installation, management, configuration, customization, testing, training, and maintenance of the FHWA's nationwide IT systems. Additional scope areas covered in this procurement include special IT projects and studies at the request of the FHWA, and creation of customer support materials.</p>
<p>The FHWA contemplates that the FITSS II contract will be an 8(a) set-aside, single-award hybrid contract, with Fixed Price and Cost Reimbursable Contract Line Item Numbers (CLIN) and one Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) CLIN. Except for the ID/IQ CLIN, the contract will be a Performance Based Acquisition, with Quality metrics and incentives, both positive and negative, for the contractor's performance against the Quality metrics.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the contract will be for a five (5) year Period of Performance, with a twelve (12) month base period and four (4) twelve (12) month option periods. The Government intends to issue fixed-price, cost-reimbursable (fee &amp; no fee), and incentive-fee task orders, as appropriate under the IDIQ CLIN. Individual orders will specify the selected contract type, and funding constraints, and the final cost/price of work efforts will be negotiated in accordance with FAR Part 15.</p>
<p>The FITSS II prime contractor will be required to utilize and apply industry standard IT and program management methodologies, including but not limited to: Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), a Process Improvement Methodology and the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). The contractor will also be required to perform against updated objectives and contractually incentivizing performance metrics, develop and apply a refined hiring methodology and procedure(s) for hard-to-fill and emerging positions, and demonstrate efficient utilization of new technology solutions, including social media. <br />The Contractor shall apply to the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) at GSA to become an approved Third Party Assessment Organization (3APO) within one year of contract award.</p>
<p>The FHWA is soliciting this effort to obtain innovative, comprehensive and integrated IT services on one contract vehicle. The FHWA requires that the awardee be capable of successfully executing against nine (9) core task areas as identified in the&nbsp;list below, and corresponding performance metrics, as established in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) in Section C of the contract.</p>
<p>(1)Program Management (2)Integrated Communications (3)Configuration/Change Management (4)Capital Planning(optional) (5)Infrastructure Support <br />(6)Application Software Management (7)Document Management(optional) <br />(8)Customer Support (9)IT Security</p>
<p>The contract will contain requirements for both contractor "transition-in" and "transition-out" activities. The contract will require the new awardee to provide a seamless 30-day transition between the incumbent and the new contractor to ensure minimal disruption to vital FHWA IT services and Government activities.</p>

<DESC>NASA/KSC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the design and fabricationof a vacuum development unit(VDU) gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Previousnotices regarding this requirement were a Sources Sought Synopsis (NNK12MA38R).The design and performance specifications include a micro gas chromatograph coupled to amass spectrometer that has the ability to obtain full mass spectrums (mass 1 amu to 70amu) at a minimum rate of 6 Hz. The instrument will be designed to quantify water,hydrocarbons, and inert components with a total analysis time of less than 3 minutes. Theinstrument will be designed for use in a vacuum chamber and will be integrated into theRESOLVE Lunar Advanced Volatile Analysis (LAVA) Subsystem. The nominal high-level concept of operation for this volatile analysis instrument is asfollows:a. A drill obtains a sample of regolith from the lunar surface.b. The GC-MS instrument and fluid system is powered up and warmed up.c. The regolith sample is delivered to the reactor vessel.d. The reactor vessel is sealed and heat is applied to raise the temperature of thesample. Heating the sample evolves volatiles from the regolith sample and causes pressureto increase in the reactor vessel. e. The fluid components transfer gas from the reactor to the inlet interface of the GC-MSinstrument (either directly or via a surge tank). f. The GC-MS analyzes the gas sample and within 5 minutes is ready to analyze the nextsample. Duplicate or triplicate samples may be required. Data relaying the concentrationof the top species of interest is transferred to the control system.g. Raw data will be transmitted and/or stored for download to the ground station whencommunication permits.h. The reactor vessel will continue to heat and evolve gas for analysis (steps a throughg).The first phase of this project will be the design of the Vacuum Development Unit (VDU)GC MS. The VDU GC-MS design will serve as the protoflight development effort. Componentsshould be spaceflight-rated components where required or have a path to flight (drop inreplacement part) based on the Class D mission classification as described in NPR 8705.4(http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?t=NPR&c=8705&s=4). The design will address the requirements with validation and verification being donethrough analysis and testing or evaluation of components or subassemblies. The designreview cycle will consist of a preliminary design review (PDR), a progress review, and acritical design review (CDR) tailored for this instrument. The entrance and exit criteriaof the PDR and CDR technical design review process can be found in NPR 7123.1A. The finaldesign package will be delivered at the conclusion of this phase of the project. Upon successful completion of the instrument design, the option exists for NASA to goforward with the fabrication of the instrument according to the design documentation.Testing of the system will be conducted as for a stand-alone instrument with initialcheckout in a vacuum chamber. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  A small business set-aside has not yet been determined. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541712 and 500 employees, respectively.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about March 30, 2012 with an anticipatedoffer due date of on or about April 30, 2012. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The installation Ombudsman is KelvinM. Manning, KSC Associate Director for Business Operations.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Ortec (Advanced Measurement Technology) of Oak Ridge, TN for Maestro Software, Detector Bias and Spectroscopy Amplifier to be used by the Radiation and Biomolecular Physics Division of the Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.
<p>The Radiation and Biomolecular Physics Division, part of the Physical Measurement Laboratory at NIST, develops, maintains and disseminates the measurement standards for ionizing radiations and radioactivity in the United States. We also pursue research in the fundamental physical interactions of ionizing and non-ionizing radiation with matter, including developing and using the key physical measurements needed in the study of biological systems and their function. Our theoretical and experimental efforts support radiation and nuclear applications in health care and worker protection, advance spectroscopic methods to enable biotechnology and medical applications, enhance environmental protection, and support national security and defense.</p>
<p>PML applies its measurement capabilities to problems of national significance through collaborations with industry, universities, professional and standards setting organizations, and other agencies of Government.</p>
<p>The Ortec Maestro Software, Detector Bias, and Spectroscopy Amplifier will be used in conjunction with an existing NIST owned Ortec Gamma Ray Spectrometry System. The Ortec Maestro Software and Spectroscopy Amplified provides NIST with the necessary updates and expansion of the existing Spectrometry System to allow for higher measurement level sources, as a result of an increased number of calibrations being received annually by the Radiation and Biomolecular Physics Division, in addition, the Detector Bias is a direct replacement of an existing detector that is no longer in operational order. The software is proprietary to Ortec, no other manufactures have the capability or compatibility with Ortecs equipment and software. If another company instrument or software were used, it would cause a significant delay in the mission of the laboratory, and the existing software and equipment would not be compatible, hindering the mission.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition 334516, with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by Friday March 09, 2012 will be considered by the Government.</p>

<CONTACT>Bruce E. Anderson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-2234, Fax 301-443-6893, Email banderso@mail.nih.gov
<DESC><p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) proposes to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) No. HHS-NIH-NIDA(MH)-12-031 entitled "Development of State Health Policy Database for Research (SHPDR) to Advance Health Economics Research on Health Care Reform" under a total small business set-aside (NAICS Code 541720 - Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities ($19M)) See: http://www.federalnewsradio.com/?nid=522&amp;sid=2742438.</p>
<p>This is a Research and Development initiative. NIMH has identified the need for better data to enable health economics research relating to health reform, including: access to administrative data beyond Medicare; data on characteristics of provider organizations; longitudinal data; more clinical information; better health and outcome measures (especially for those currently uninsured and regardless of payer); data for smaller geographic areas; and, data representative of the populations of interest. To understand the influence of newly acquired health coverage will require before-and-after data. Different public and private organizations have state policy level information from their specific perspectives, including, legal, financial, public health perspectives, but there is no one integrated database for health policy relevant health economics research.</p>
<p>Contract services are solicited to develop a State Health Policy Database for Research (SHPDR) which can be easily used by academic researchers, with statistical software, and can be easily linked with relevant existing public health and economic indicators for hypothesis driven empirical scientific research. This resource will be a core, multivariate, raw data set with carefully selected numerical and nominal variables on high priority selected state health policies. It is envisioned that this data set which captures information for CY2010, will be the base year data set before health reform implementation, and will be available as a public use data set for the research community on or about July 31, 2014.</p>
<p>The SHPDR to be developed and delivered under this contract shall have certain characteristics to ensure its research utility. <br /><br />This database shall address: <br />1. State-level policy variables derived from publicly available state health statutes focusing on their state-specific health and economic incentive structure and fiscal parameters. Linkage to full documentation of the primary policy sources shall be considered integral part of the data set.<br />2. Easy linking to state and individual-level data sets from health and economic surveys and administrative claims data to facilitate wide use by researchers<br />3. Key research questions in health economics; and<br />4. Critical information needed to promote efficiency and quality in the financing and delivery of health care services that will improve the health of individual, families, communities, and populations.</p>
<p>General information:<br />This is a Presolicitation Notice in advance of the Request for Proposal (RFP), and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The RFP, HHS-NIH-NIDA(MH)-12-031, detailing the specifics of the project as well as information pertinent to the development of an offeror's proposal will be available electronically on or about March 16, 2012, and may be accessed through the Internet at the Federal Business Opportunities website at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. No paper copies will be available. Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments and for routinely checking the Internet site for any possible solicitation amendments that may be issued by the Government. Proposals will be due on or about April 27, 2012. It is anticipated that one (1) cost-reimbursement contract award will be made for a period of five (5) years beginning on or about September 15, 2012. The contract will be Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) and extent of database development is indefinite.</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation notice corresponds to the Small Business Sources Sought notice #HHS-NIH-DA-SBSS-12-236, same title as above, which was previously posted on November 1, 2011.</p>
<p>All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal that will be considered by the NIMH. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. No additional details will be provided until after such time that the Request For Proposal is published.</p>

<DESC>FEDBIZOPS Synopsis
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently in the acquisition planning stage for the potential award of a contract for contract support to assist its efforts in developing and implementing regulations.    The services that will be provided by this contract are necessary to investigate chemical, radiological and microbiological contaminant occurrences to characterize drinking water threats.  This contract will support EPA?s development of National Primary Drinking Water Regulations for various contaminants as well as requirements for ground water and Underground Injection Control (UIC) in accordance with the Safe Drinking Water Act.  The Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water requires contract support for (1) regulatory development, (2) policy and program implementation, (3) information management and technology tools development, (4) outreach, (5) technical writing, and (6) logistics coordination.
The successful contractor shall provide all necessary labor, materials, services, equipment and facilities to support the efforts delineated by the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Services to be performed under this contract are to provide technical and analytical support for environmental and analytical chemistry, statistics, engineering, hydrology, hydrogeology, public health and risk assessment, system analysis, cost and benefit assessments, database management, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and microbiology relating to the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) Amendments. 
Services to be performed under this contract shall provide support for development of standards, criteria, and program mandates being considered by the Agency relative to the requirements of the SDWA Amendments and other statutes (such as Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) and Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) already in place.  Additionally, the contractor shall also provide administrative program support in areas of information management, outreach, technical writing and coordination of logistics.
This is a follow on requirement to provide technical and administrative support for the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) for the Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW), but does include new task areas in the Performance Work Statement.  The current contractor supporting this requirement is The Cadmus Group, Inc. under Contract EP-C-07-022.  The new contract is anticipated to be a CPFF, Level of Effort, term contract and will have a base period with (6) twelve month option periods.  The base period and each option period will consist of approximately 23,000 direct labor hours for a base quantity, and another 46,000 of optional quantity available in each period, to provide flexibility should national events require it. Total maximum Level of Effort, if all quantity options are exercised, for the seven years of anticipated performance is estimated at 483,000 direct labor hours.  Anticipated award date for this contract is November 1, 2012.					Due to the size of the requirement, the RFP shall be conducted using FULL and OPEN competition procedures.  Significant evaluation will be given to the use of socio-economic diversity by the offeror in its proposal.  The NAICS code for the effort is 541611.  Interested small, small disadvantaged, HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran, 8(a), and Woman Owned Small Businesses who would like to have their areas of expertise included on a source list attached to the Cincinnati website concerning this RFP should immediately submit the following information to the Contract Specialist: Name and address of company; specific contact within company including name, telephone, and e-mail address; company website address; short summary of expertise area within the projected scope of work (3 line maximum); socio-economic classification; and NAICS codes.  This information will be updated until two weeks before the proposals are due, to allow interested Primes the opportunity to review potential  team members.
Significant potential exists for an organizational conflict of interest under this procurement. It is EPA?s contention that a potential organizational COI may exist if award were to be made to firms within the following groups or to firms that have significant business or financial relationships with these firms:(1) Firms that own, operate or invest in waste management/waste disposal firms; (2) firms that are subject to EPA regulations or guidelines that may be impacted by efforts under this contract; (3) firms that manufacture/sell/import/develop water treatment chemicals and/or equipment (including point-of-use/point-of-entry treatment devices); 4) firms that facilitate the development of third party voluntary consensus standards or technical standards (e.g., materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, business practices, etc.) that are developed by voluntary consensus standard bodies; (5) Firms that produce and distribute bottled water would benefit from k nowing the drinking water contaminants EPA was considering for the regulatory process; (6) Firms that own or operate public water systems would benefit from knowing the drinking water contaminates EPA was considering for the regulatory process; and (7) Firms that own or operate regulated Underground Injection Control (UIC) Wells. 
Also, the solicitation will include the clause entitled LIMITATION OF FUTURE CONTRACTING (LOFC) which states in part: ?The contractor, during the life of this contract and for a period of two years (2) following the completion of this contract, will be ineligible to enter into business or financial relationships which would support or affect any efforts to contest, oppose, or influence the contents of regulations, policies, limitations, standards or criteria relating to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Clean Water Act,  for which it has provided, is providing, or has work assignments to provide technical and administrative support under this contract, without prior written authorization from the EPA cognizant contracting officer.?  Be advised, however, that the afore-mentioned limitations may change when the RFP is released.
Solicitation RFP-CI-11-00062 will appear on the internet and it may be accessed through the EPA?s home page on the World Wide Net (www.epa.gov).  It is the responsibility of interested offerors to frequently check the FEDBizOpps or the EPA website address for updates or changes.  See Cincinnati website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd for posted draft Performance Work Statement, draft security related requirements, and the interested party source list for this requirement.  Be advised, Performance Work Statement changes are possible when final RFP is released.   The direct link URL for the RFP when issued is http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  It is anticipated that this solicitation will be issued on or around March 19, 2012. No hard copies will be available.

<CONTACT>Lauren A. Gooding, Phone 2027673003, Email lauren.gooding@nrl.navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) intends to negotiate a contract on the basis of Other Than Full and Open Competition IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source. NRL will negotiate with Nion, Inc, 1102 8th St., Kirkland, WA 98033, for a Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope (STEM) Column and Accessories. The STEM requires an ultra-high vacuum scanning transmission with a demonstrated capability to image single boron and carbon atoms and a spatial resolution exceeding 80 picometers for imaging of diamond samples. The microscope shall provide ultra-high vacuum (UHV) in the sample area and operate at 60kV, below the displacement energy threshold for graphitically-bonded carbon. The microscope column and all accessories combined, including the field emission gun, aberration corrector, and spectrometers, must be less &lt;12' high, in order to be compatible with the ceiling height of the NRL laboratory space. <br /><br />The minimum requirements for the STEM Column are as follows: (1) The column vacuum pressure must be 1x10-9 torr or lower, in order to maximize the imaging time before degradation of graphene samples exposed to the electron beam. (2) The column must include the electronic optics and detectors necessary for bright-field and dark-field imaging. (3) The microscope column must enable direct imaging of atomic-monolayer samples, with a spatial resolution sufficient to resolve adjacent carbon atoms in graphene, and the sensitivity to image and identify single atoms of B, C, N and O. (4) The column must include a sample exchange chamber with a camera for monitoring sample insertion and removal. (5) The sample stage must provide translation in 3 orthogonal axes (x, y, z). (6) Two types of sample holders must be provided that accommodate standard 3 mm transmission electron microscopy grids. The first type of holder must enable sample translation in three orthogonal axis (x,y,z). The second type of holder must allow tilting of the sample to +/- 25&deg; in two orthogonal directions, in addition to (x,y,z) translation. (7) A sample bake-out chamber separate from the microscope must be provided. (8) The sample translation in the plane of the sample grid (x,y) must be controllable to 2 nm. (9) The column must include a charged couple device (CCD) camera for imaging of ronchiograms. (10) Automation software for computer control of all column functions must be provided. (11) Two (2) PC computers must be provided to interface directly to the microscope electronics and to collect images from the microscope. (12) The height of the microscope, including the column and gun must not exceed 12'.<br /><br />The minimum requirements for the STEM Accessories which include the Cold Field-Emission Electron Gun and a Spherical Aberration Corrector Lens are as follows: The cold-field emission electron gun must (1) operate at a voltage range of at least 60 kV to 200 kV, to enable imaging below the damage displacement threshold of graphitic C-C bonds, and to allow for analysis of samples 100 nm to 200 nm thick. (2) The energy spread of the emitted electrons must be &lt; 0.4 eV at an operating voltage of 200 kV. The spherical aberration corrector lens must (1) be a lens for correction of spherical aberrations of the probe up to 5th order must be provided. (2) The lens must be coupled to the objective lens of the microscope column. <br />In addition there are two optional items in which the Government reserves the right not to exercise. The minimum requirements for each option are listed below:<br /><br />(1)	Electron-energy loss (EEL) spectrometer must be compatible with the STEM column. (2) The EEL spectrometer must provide 0.4 eV or better energy resolution, as determined by full-width half maximum of the zero-loss peak width for a 1 second acquisition. (3) The EEL spectrometer must be compatible with maintaining a column vacuum pressure of 10-9 torr or better.<br />(1)	Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer must be compatible with the STEM column. (2)The EDX spectrometer must use a silicon-drift detector for cryogen-free operation. (3)The EDX spectrometer must be compatible with maintaining a column vacuum pressure of 10-9 torr or better.
<p>Delivery will be required within 365 days of contract award. If the Government exercises the option CLINs, it shall be no later than 6 (six) months from date of award. If Options are exercised they shall be delivered at the time of delivery of CLINs 0001-0003. Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.</p>

Upon submission of the SF330 qualification package the prospective firm must be listed and publicly viewable in the Vetbiz Registry or they shall be considered nonresponsive to award. Prior to award the prospective contractor, otherwise eligible for award, must be registered and VERIFIED at http://www.vip.vetbiz.gov. The number one selected firm, unless currently listed as verified in the Vendor Information Pages at the www.vetbiz.gov database shall have five business days to submit a verification application upon notification of being found the apparent successful bidder. Failure to become registered and verified in the VetBiz registry will result in denial of contract award. After receipt of verification application, the VA Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) will conduct an SDVOSB verification investigation of the firm and based upon their findings will either find the firm eligible or ineligible for SDVOSB verification. Any AE firm that represents itself as an SDVOSB eligible firm but subsequently found ineligible for verification by VA OSDBU will result in that firm being barred from contract award.

<DESC>The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) requires chartering an offshore research vessel capable of working in broken sea ice to support a walrus radio-tagging project in the northern Chukchi Sea for a maximum of 14 days between July 11, 2012 and July 25, 2012.  The work area will be the northeastern Chukchi Sea at the southern edge of the retreating pack ice.  One workboat will be provided by USGS and must be loaded onto the charter vessel from a port with road access near Anchorage, Alaska.  The vessel will be required to transit to Nome, AK or other appropriate port near the target field work, pick up the science crew, and continue to the work area for arrival to the work area by about July 14, 2012.  The estimated location of the initial target area will be 150 nautical miles west of Barrow, but is ultimately dependent on sea ice conditions at the time.  The vessel will operate within the sea ice margin.  Radio-tagging will occur for up to 10 days, and then the vessel will return the science crew to either Wainwright or Nome.  The vessel will provide transportation and support for the science crew of 5 to 9 people working for USGS, as well a suitable workboat and experienced boat operator.  The size of the USGS crew will be agreed upon at least one month prior to sailing.

<DESC>RELOCATION OF LOCALIZER SHELTER<br />Lackland AFB, TX
<p>SOURCES SOUGHT <br />February 24, 2012</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to acquire contractual support to relocate the existing ILS Localizer Shelter 33 North end of runway and the ILS Localizer Shelter 15 on South end of runway. Note: The 33 North Runway Localizer Shelter Relocation shall include the relocation of the existing Back-up generator and installation of a new above-ground 3 day fuel tank with catch basin and a new 4-Pole transfer switch. These shelter relocation projects are needed to resolve airfield frangibility issues previously identified by the Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA). This contract shall include the construction of new concrete foundations for the North (33) Localizer shelter, the back-up generator for the north-end localizer and the South (15) Localizer shelter. AFFSA shall recertify the systems as being fully operational to support flight operations.</p>
<p>1. AFSPC 38 Cyberspace Engineering Installation Group (CEIG) is requesting information from industry as part of market research to determine what qualified contractors exist. <br />2. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bid, a solicitation, or an indication the US Air Force (AF) or 38 CEIG will contract for the items contained in the sources sought. 38 CEIG will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this sources sought.<br />3. This proposed contract is being considered as a set-aside under a small business set-aside program. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 237130. The size standard for NAICS 237130 is $33.5 million or less in average annual receipts. The government is interested in all small businesses including (8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses that are interested in performing this requirement. The government requests interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size (i.e. annual revenues and employee size), business status (i.e., 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Women Owned Small Business or small business) anticipated teaming arrangements, and a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners. The Government will use this information in determining its small business set-aside decision. In addition, request Contractor to provide a list of any other NAICS they feel are more applicable than the one specified above. Contractor shall specify business size status for each NAICS included in response. Provide enrollment status and expiration date in the Central Contractors Registration System. <br />4. Provide formal responses to the tasks listed below. Address your capabilities to accomplish the below tasks and provide highlights of successful past experience on similar contracts within the past 3 years.<br />a. Design and construct foundations for the localizer equipment shelters, including equipotential ground planes at both new shelter locations.</p>
<p>b. Extend existing power and communications signal cables and install new junction boxes for each from the old location to the new location. Runway 33 North Localizer Shelter relocation places the closest foundation edge 270' southwest or perpendicular of the antenna centerline. Runway 15 South Localizer shelter relocation is 260' southwest or perpendicular of the antenna centerline. This will place the shelter inside the support road, approximately 60' southwest of the current location. Trenching will be required. <br />c. Relocate the existing shelter to the new foundation. Install the required power cable and signal cables, and supply all connectors.<br />d. AFFSA will recertify the localizer is operable and ready for flight operations.<br />e. Remove the old shelter foundations and dispose of them in accordance with local policy.<br />5. Interested contractors should address potential organizational conflicts of interests, reference FAR 9.505-1 and if applicable submit mitigation plans with capability statements.

In 2010 the Society for the Advancement of Violence and Injury Research (SAVIR) identified 11 indicator topics categories. <br /><br />The potential project seeks to refine the definitions of indicators from the 11 topic categories, identified by SAVIR, and identify rules for inclusion to develop a set of essential measures for assessing the overall ICRC Program and monitoring progress of individual centers. In addition, the project seeks to identify recommended procedures for data collection, analysis, reporting, and possible roles/responsibilities among key stakeholders. <br /><br />The vendor will be required to identify and refine a core number of indicators and to develop procedures for operationalizing the collection, analysis, and reporting of essential ICRC indicators. All essential indicators must have specific and standardized definitions for assessing the overall ICRC Program, also they must include: rules for inclusion, frequency, targets, number/denominator, examples, etc. The vendor shall conduct regular conference calls with the CDC COR, provide a work plan, and provide regular written progress reports.

Also the vendor shall provide examples of projects conducted that are similar in complexity and scope to illustrate experience and organizational capacity.<br /><br />Several NAICS codes are recommended for this acquisition: 541270 - R&amp;D in the Social Sciences and Humanities; 541690 - Other Scientific and Consulting Services; 541990 - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. However, if responsible sources believe there is a different code that can work better for this requirement, they can recommend the code to the Contracting Officer with an explanation of why they feel the code is more appropriate. Also, if you feel that this acquisition can be purchased through GSA, please advise the Contracting Officer which GSA schedule would be applicable.

<p>The requirements include Development, Operations and Sustainment (O&amp;S), Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S), Engineering Services, and Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Test Planning, Execution and Analysis support across the X-Band Radars. The requirements also include the likely production of one additional AN/TPY-2 Radar and the potential production of additional AN/TPY-2 components, spares, and fleet refurbishment activity. MDA will utilize responses received to develop acquisition strategy alternatives that may include competing all or portions of X-Band radar future work. With the exception of production, which is based on required quantities and delivery dates, MDA/SN anticipates contracting for future work for period(s) of performance of up to five years, depending on final approved contract strategy.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information (RFI) or to otherwise pay for the information.

<DESC>The National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) is an independent, bipartisan board that sets policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), commonly known as The Nation's Report Card. NAEP makes objective information on student performance available to policy makers and the public at the national, state, and local levels. It has served an important role in evaluating the condition and progress of American education for more than three decades. Created by Congress in 1988, the Governing Board is made up of 26 members, including governors, state legislators, local and state school officials, educators and researchers, business representatives, and members of the general public. More information on the Governing Board and its work is at www.nagb.org.
<p><br />The Governing Board has important congressional mandates to set policy for the NAEP and to take appropriate actions that improve the form, content, use, and reporting of assessment results, plan and execute the initial public release of NAEP reports. A key component in providing feedback on the Governing Board's work and disseminating NAEP is through expanded outreach activities with targeted audiences across the nation. As increased attention is drawn to the NAEP, particularly with the Common Core State Standards, it is important to encourage and expand the involvement of state policymakers and educators in providing information and input to the Governing Board in executing its congressionally mandated responsibilities.</p>
<p>Since September 2007, the Governing Board has partnered with the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) to establish a jointly sponsored Task Force. The Governing Board/CCSSO Policy Task Force provides advisory and support services.&nbsp;The Task Force is charged with providing feedback from states including recommendations to the National Assessment Governing Board on policy areas and projects related to the NAEP.</p>
<p>The goal of this collaboration is to seek state input and feedback that informs the Governing Board's policy setting work in specific areas. Therefore, the Task Force is comprised of 12 high-level state education agency leaders including 1 chief state school officer, 8 members who are either deputy or assistant superintendents, and 3 public information officers. This wide cross section of perspectives vested in education will help shape careful and extensive deliberations on many NAGB/NAEP policy areas.</p>
<p>The Task Force conducts its work through webinars and in-person meetings. The work and partnership are facilitated by a purchase order each fiscal year. The Task Force provides regular reports to the Governing Board, which are available to the public via meeting transcripts of the Governing Board's quarterly meetings.</p>
<p>In each fiscal year, two in-person meetings and four webinars shall be convened. Topics to be discussed by the Task Force include reporting approaches for the 2012 and 2013 NAEP reports, 12th grade preparedness research and reporting issues, achievement level setting, testing students with disabilities and English language learners, subjects assessed by NAEP including their value to states, and NAEP's role in the era of the Common Core State Standards and assessments. In addition, one Task Force member shall attend each of the Governing Board's quarterly meetings as an observer to share and promote communication between the Governing Board and the Task Force.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Subpart 6.3 - Other Than Full and Open Competition, and under the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source - the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) - has the unique membership of Chief State School Officers and state policymakers who have the knowledge and ability to provide state perspectives and outreach services representing all 50 states. This coordination among all 50 states and the federal government is essential for making informed policy decisions related to The Nation's Report Card and for carrying out the Board's congressionally-mandated responsibilities.</p>
<p>The National Assessment Governing Board intends to award a sole source contract to the CCSSO in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13 -- Simplified Acquisitions, under the authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2) as only one responsible source can provide the required services.</p>
<p>Organizations and persons may identify their interest in and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; a solicitation will not be issued. However, all capability statements received by March 19, 2012 will be considered by the Governing Board in developing the proposed acquisition strategy. Questions or suggestions received before March 9, 2012 will have written responses posted via www.fedbizopps.gov. Please submit written questions or comments to Munira.Mwalimu@ed.gov.</p>

<CONTACT>Joseph Tannenbaum 202-781-2629
<DESC>PURPOSE:
The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) on behalf of PMS 320 Electric Ships Office (ESO), seeking information from industry to assist in updating the Next Generation Integrated Power System (NGIPS) Technology Development Roadmap issued in November 2007.  The effort is being led by PMS 320, under the direction of the ESO Executive Steering Group, which consists of Flag level members from related organizations across NAVSEA, Program Executive Offices, ONR, and OPNAV.  The updated document is expected to be expanded in scope from the 2007 edition and be titled the Naval Power Systems Technology Development Roadmap (NPS TDR).
	
DESCRIPTION:
The updated NPS TDR document will reflect potential back fit applications as well as the Navys current 30 year shipbuilding plan, with a renewed focus on energy efficiency and energy security, evolving technology alternatives, and a refined approach to capability requirements and capability based budgeting.
  The NPS TDR will be used to set power system goals, target investments, and support naval missions. 

Many key tenets of the previous roadmap will be retained, such as focusing developments to reduce total ownership costs, addressing cross platform commonality, providing more power for advanced mission systems, and improving the quality of service (power continuity).  The new roadmap is expected to be publicly released in order to promote dialogue, inform academia and industry, and guide Navy, DoD and industry investments. The overarching goals of the roadmap are to align developments with war fighter needs, enable capability based budgeting, and provide appropriate, mature technologies to meet platform timelines and mission requirements.

The focus of this request is to gather information necessary to assess the current and future state of electrical and mechanical power systems technologies from the industry perspective in the near-term (0-10 years), mid-term (10-20 years) and far-term (20-30 years) timeframes.
  The primary areas of interest are power conversion, energy storage, motors and generators, prime movers, power distribution, power controls, high power loads, and information on advanced materials related to the primary areas of interest.  Within these areas, the Navy is interested in identifying and understanding any industry trends, emerging technologies, or breakthrough technologies that could benefit Naval Power Systems and when they might be available to the Navy.  By updating the NPS TDR, the Navy seeks to align expectations with evolving and emerging power systems technologies to provide guidance to the military, industrial, and research communities. 

RESPONSES:
PMS 320 is requesting information from industry to be more informed in the development of the NPS TDR and to allow industry the opportunity to influence the nature of the NPS TDR prior to its release.
 The questionnaire attached to this announcement is intended to provide the framework for the industry feedback.  This questionnaire is divided into 3 parts.  Part 1 contains general questions to provide the Navy a broad understanding of your technology(ies) and the current and near term market.  Part 2 contains specific questions to allow the Navy to benchmark technologies.  Part 3 contains questions based on future technologies and market trends.  Responses should indicate enough detail so that potential Navy interest can be assessed.  The Navy technical team working on the development of the NPS TDR is available to direct, one-on-one, conversations about the objective of this effort and any industry concerns or questions, with the contact information identified below.

Information should be e-mailed or faxed to Mr.
 John Kuseian at john.kuseian@navy.mil or 215-897-8380 respectively.  For technical matters, please contact Mr. John Kuseian at john.kuseian@navy.mil or by phone at 215-897-8330 or Ms. Melissa Smoot at melissa.smoot@navy.mil  or by phone at 202-781-5134.  For administrative matters, please contact Mr. Joseph Tannenbaum at joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil or Mr. Adam Goldberg at adam.goldberg@navy.mil.  Please label any correspondence with the solicitation number and Naval Power Systems Technology Development Roadmap Update RFI.

Responses are requested by 10:00 am (EST), on April 6, 2012. However, submissions will be accepted after this date, but feedback may not be as timely or contribute to NAVSEAs strategic planning.
  Responses are requested to be provided electronically and acceptable formats include Adobe PDF, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint files. Questions can be submitted electronically to joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil.  If the information you provide is sensitive or subject to limited distribution, please mark it accordingly and that information shall be treated as Business Sensitive and will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies without the permission of the provider.  However, the end objective of a publishable NPS TDR should be a consideration when making this determination.

This RFI in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies.
 The information provided may assist NAVSEA in developing and further defining future procurement and acquisition strategies.  Defense and commercial contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.  This RFI is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government. NAVSEA may request further information regarding the technical data provided or capabilities of respondents and may request a presentation or a site visit as deemed necessary.

<DESC>The Savannah District Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) for large scale construction contracts (exceeding $25 million) within the Savannah District Design/Construction Boundaries (http://www.sas.usace.army.mil/districtboundaries.html).
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are: <br />(1) The project will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades.<br />(2) There is a shortage of skilled labor in the region in which the construction project will be sited.<br />(3) Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br />(4) Project labor agreements have been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of the project.<br />(5) A project labor agreement will promote the agency's long term program interests, such as facilitating the training of a skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs.<br />PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy states: Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) be consistent with law. <br />Reference: Provision: FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement, Clause: FAR 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the Savannah District Design/Construction Boundaries(http://www.sas.usace.army.mil/districtboundaries.html)? <br />(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br />(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br />(4) Have there been any Project labor agreements used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area?<br />(5) Would a project labor agreement promote Savannah District's long term program interests, such as facilitating the training of a skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs?<br />(6) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a U.S. Army Corps of Engineer, Savannah District contract?</p>
<p>Responses shall be submitted via email to CESAS-CT.SAS@usace.army.mil no later than 3 p.m. (EST) on 20 March 2012. This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this survey.</p>

SUBJECT:	Continuation of Russian English 
Interpreter Service on the US-Russian Polar Bear Commission and Scientific Working Group MeetingsThis announcement constitutes the only notice.This is not a request for quotes.
A determination not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. Responses must be received no later than 2:00 PM, Tuesday February 21, 2012 sending an e-mail to millie_cortes@fws.gov; however, any technical data received will be for the sole purpose of market research for future requirements.
Under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), Fish & Wildlife Services, Region 7 Contracting and General Services intends to issue a sole source, firm-fixed price order to:
COMPANIES:	Marian Bell (Duns No. 127276231) and Olga Romanenko (Duns No. 081928348)
FOR :	Translation and Interpretation
ON:	March 1st, 2012
NAICS:	541930	
AUTHORITY:	13.106(b) Soliciting from a single source
Determinations not to compete this proposed procurement were made because:
This is a continuation of the Scientific Working Group and Commission meetings, these meetings are following on service of work done under the US-Russia Agreement.  Services have included oral interpretation and written translation of previous correspondence of the Commission and Scientific Working Group.
The primary source has been used since the implementation of the US-Russia Agreement began in 2008.
We require someone who has experience translating on the topic of polar bear biology.  The service will be performed in Anchorage, AK, on pre-established dates/times.  
The sensitivity of negotiations under this Agreement requires familiarity with the history of the Agreement, the individuals involved in Russia and the US who are implementing the Agreement, and the biology of polar bears.  By having someone on board who is already knowledgeable with the material at hand and the personnel, it greatly enhances our ability to effectively implement the Agreement as required by law.  Maintaining continuity in interpreters and translators greatly facilitates the effectiveness of our work and communications.  These sources have been working as interpreters and translators since the inception of this Agreement.  They have the extensive experience needed to best facilitate negotiations and effective implementation of this Agreement.
Background: In 2000, the US and Russia signed into action the Agreement Between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on the Conservation and Management of the Alaska Chukotka Polar Bear Population.  In 2007, Congress passed legislation to allow the implementation of this agreement.  Since 2008, the US-Russia Polar Bear Commission and supporting Scientific Working Group have been meeting annually, as outlined in the Agreement, to combine efforts to manage and conserve the Alaska-Chukotka (Chukchi-Bering Seas) polar bear population.  In 2012, it is the US=BFs turn to host both the Commission and Scientific Working Group meetings.  Documents prepared for and from these meetings will require English to Russian and Russian to English translation.  Oral interpretation services are needed at both the Scientific Working Group and Commission meetings.  Additionally, interpreters are needed to facilitate communication prior to the meeting as we jointly prepare agendas, invitations, and transportation.  The continuation of interpretation service and knowledge on the subject is essential for the continued development and smooth transition of the Scientific Working Group and Commission meetings, these sources are equipped and up to date on all transition planning, collective materials, and policies.

<a href="mailto:gary.frye1@navy.mil">POINT OF CONTACT </a>
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane.

The United States Government (USG) is issuing this sources-sought announcement as part of a Market Survey and Request for Information (RFI) and is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).

The Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC Crane) is seeking information for market research purposes for an Enhanced Combat Optical Sight  Optimized (ECOS-O).The objective of this announcement is to release a draft performance specification for ECOS-O with the intent to elicit comments from industry and academia to help further shape the specification before solicitation.
  The Closing Date for receipt of comments on the draft ECOS-O performance specification is 3/30/2012.  

This announcement is a public invitation.  Failure to participate or provide written feedback to the draft performance specification will not preclude abstaining vendors from bidding on possible future solicitations.  This announcement is part of the full-, free-, and open- competition process, which encourages industry and academia to help shape Government specifications to match what is possible, affordable, and timely.  Failure to participate in this open pre-solicitation conference or to provide written feedback may result in a future Government performance specification over which the abstaining vendors have limited influence in the acquisition process, and may deprive abstaining vendors of potentially valuable direct early interaction with contracting officials and acquisition planners.
 Any information provided that is marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.  The Government may elect to visit, or host a visit, from any potential sources following the market survey.  Your interest in this program is appreciated.

This sources sought synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information furnished pursuant to this RFI.  Nor is the Government tasking any offeror to develop any technologies described herein.
  The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.

<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION: Tactical Network Testbed (TNT) Collaboration
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.<br />The purpose of this RFI is to solicit technology experimentation candidates from Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations, private industry, and academia for inclusion in future experimentation events coordinated by the U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). USSOCOM invites industry, academia, individuals and Government labs to submit technology experimentation nominations addressing innovative technologies leading to possible Government/Industry collaboration for development of USSOCOM technology capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter.</p>
<p>SOF experimentation focus areas for FY12 will explore emerging technologies, technical applications, and their potential to provide solutions with an understanding in concepts, operations and future SOF capabilities. SOF experimentation focus areas have been assigned for each of the four quarterly TNT events scheduled in FY12 as follows:</p>
<p>- November 2011: Small Team Force Protection; Communications; Power and Water Generation.<br />- February 2012: Mission Planning, Modeling, Simulation, and Training; Combat Weather; Military Information <br />Support Operation (MISO) and Civil Affairs (CA)<br />- May 2012: Warrior Systems; Small Unit Weapon Systems <br />- August 2012: Mobility and Vehicle Protection</p>
<p>Additional RFIs will be released to FedBizOpps approximately 60 days prior to each scheduled TNT event to provide additional details.</p>
<p>After review of the technology experimentation nomination submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to experiment their technologies at the USSOCOM &amp; NPS sponsored TNT experimentation event. The TNT venue will provide an opportunity for the submitter to interact with USSOCOM personnel for the purpose of USSOCOM assessing potential impact of emerging technology solutions on USSOCOM missions and capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the SOF warfighter. Industry participation in experimentation activities does not suggest or imply that USSOCOM or NPS will procure or purchase equipment.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>1. Background: USSOCOM conducts quarterly TNT experimentation events in cooperation with NPS at Camp Roberts, CA (three per year) and at Avon Park, FL (one per year). These cooperative TNT experiments are conducted with representatives from Government R&amp;D organizations, academia, and private industry. TNT experimentation events provide an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel to determine how their technology development efforts and ideas may support or enhance SOF capability needs. The environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between Government, academia, and industry to promote the identification and assessment of emerging and mature technologies for the primary goal of accelerating the delivery of technology discoveries to the SOF warfighter.</p>
<p>Mission-Based Experimentation (MBE) provides remedied solutions to identified high priority, high value SOF mission deficiencies allowing evolution and adaptation in the field to quickly help identify solutions designed to mission objectives. The Government's intent is to take selected respondent technology into unimproved expeditionary-like conditions for up to three (3) days and return the submitted technology to respondent upon completion of exercise. All respondents will be required to complete a vendor loan agreement (see attachment) to participate in the MBE. Materiel solutions should be at a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 or greater for the purpose of MBE.</p>
<p>Capability-Based Experimentation (CBE) provides an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel and determine how their efforts might support special operations capabilities in a discovery learning environment. A discovery learning environment includes interaction and collaboration between industry, government labs, academia and other government interests. CBE identifies potential technology solutions, impacts, limitations, and utility to meet SOF technical objectives and thrust areas. Materiel solutions should be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or greater for the purpose of CBE. CBE experiments will be between a half day and five days in duration and be conducted in unimproved expeditionary-like conditions.</p>
<p>2. Experimentation Focus: Experiments will be conducted from 1-11 May 2012, at Camp Roberts, CA. The venue will explore emerging technology solutions for: Warrior Systems and Small Unit Weapon Systems. Technology will need to be capable of supporting a SOF team (6 members), up to a platoon (44 members), to provide a transformational increase in SOF small units' ability to detect, identify, hit, and kill threat targets. Technology candidate are not limited to lethal projectile delivery platforms; optics, ballistic solution devices, and improved or novel munitions are examples of weapon system related technology that is suitable for this experimentation focus.</p>
<p>A secondary focus is in the area of a Battlefield Casualty Integration System. Participants are encouraged to address remote wireless vital signs monitoring, handheld electronic device which captures the casualties vital signs, transmission of medical data to helicopter and ground based facilities (up to several hundred miles away), and electronic verification of identification through Near Field Communication. <br /><br />(a) MBE 12-3: 01-05 May 2012 at Camp Roberts, CA. Focus: MBE 12-3 will focus on Warrior Systems and Small Unit Weapon Systems. Technology should be at Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL-6) or greater for the purpose of MBE. Any and all solutions must provide all necessary software and hardware to accomplish the mission. The focus of MBE will be on assessing the military utility and technology readiness level. Warrior systems and small unit weapon systems may include enhancements to the capability to escalate the application of force while limiting collateral damage, the synergy between Force Application and Force Protection enabling SOF to dominate small unit engagements.</p>
<p>(b) CBE 12-3 06-11 May, 2012 at Camp Roberts, CA. Focus: CBE 12-3 will focus on Warrior Systems and Small Unit Weapon Systems. Experiments will be conducted to explore the application of emerging technology solutions for SOF Small Unit Dominance. Technology should be at Technology Readiness Level 3 (TRL-3) or greater for the purpose of CBE.<br /><br />3. Security Requirements: Vendors should not submit classified information in the technology experimentation nominations.</p>
<p>4. Respondents interested in live fire experiments shall conduct and submit a safety risk assessment. The risk assessment shall address the likelihood and severity of any inherent risks as well as risk mitigation measures required to bring the resultant risk to a low level. The risk assessment shall be submitted as an attachment to the experiment nomination.

<p><strong>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE</strong>: Initial Announcement</p>
<p><strong>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER</strong>: BAA-RWK-10-0001</p>
<p><strong>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) NUMBER(S):</strong> 12.800 Air Force Defense Research Sciences Program</p>
<p><strong>WHITE PAPER DUE DATE AND TIME</strong>: This BAA will remain open through 30 April 2011, or until amended or superseded. It may be reissued and/or amended periodically, as needed. <strong>White papers</strong> may be submitted at any time during the open period to <strong>afrl.rwk.baaworkflow@eglin.af.mil</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>I. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>This is a Broad Agency Announcement of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW) under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraph 6.102(d)(2), which provides for competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.</p>
<p>For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs. It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs. A program should be designed to demonstrate well-defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not be a paper study that inherently requires a substantial testing effort. Any significant testing is unlikely; however, there is a possibility of experimental testing to support battle lab experiments proposed under this BAA. Occasionally, AFRL/RW will have more specific research interests or topics that warrant specific attention. Under those circumstances, a specific BAA will be issued describing the requirement in greater detail, defining funding availability, elaborating on white paper or proposal submission due date and format, and possibly providing more specific evaluation criteria. Programs to support Team Eglin Technology Demonstration Programs may also be considered under this BAA.</p>
<p>AFRL/RW contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in armament technology. This BAA is intended to cover, in general nature, all research areas of interest to this Directorate. Offerors contemplating submission of a proposal to AFRL/RW should carefully examine this BAA, and are also strongly encouraged to contact the appropriate AFRL/RW technical Point of Contact (POC) identified in this publication to ascertain the extent of interest AFRL/RW may have in a specific research project.</p>
<p>AFRL/RW is the primary Air Force organization concerned with conventional munitions technology development. AFRL/RW plans and executes research, development, and test of conventional munitions, and supports conventional munitions Wings/Groups or Weapons Program Offices. There are four divisions within the Munitions Directorate that conduct research and development (R&amp;D). They are the Demonstration Division, the Advanced Guidance Division, the Strategic Planning and Assessment Division, and the Ordnance Division.</p>
<p><strong>DEMONSTRATION DIVISION (RWA)</strong><br />The Demonstration Division (RWA) directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development in weapon/missile airframes, and submunition design and dispensing. RWA also integrates optimal subsystems, performs tests, and conducts flight demonstrations. RWA consists of the Systems of Systems Branch (RWAS), and the Flight Vehicles Integration Branch (RWAV).</p>
<p><strong>ADVANCED GUIDANCE DIVISION (RWG)</strong><br />The Advanced Guidance Division (RWG) conducts research and directs exploratory and advanced development in guidance and control technology to support development of autonomous, precision-guided munitions. The relevant technologies are in two general areas: seekers and conventional guidance and control. The seeker technologies include electro-optical, infrared, millimeter-wave, and radio frequency seekers for air-to-air and air-to-surface conventional weapons, exointerceptors, and submunition guidance. This includes signal/image processing algorithms and processors. Conventional guidance and control includes inertial sensors, global positioning system (GPS) receivers, antijam GPS technologies, and relevant information processing including guidance laws, state vector estimators, and autopilots. RWG performs digital modeling and simulation, synthetic scene generation, laboratory, field, and captive flight tests of seeker concepts and conventional guidance and control concepts. RWG also operates and maintains a hardware-in-the-loop closed loop guidance evaluation facility with synthetic scene generation and digital modeling and simulation capability, a radio-frequency measurement laboratory, a laser radar facility, an advanced navigation laboratory, and an electro-optics laboratory. RWG consists of the Integration Guidance Simulation Branch (RWGG), Integration Sensing &amp; Processing Sciences Branch (RWGI), Weapons Dynamics &amp; Controls Branch (RWGN), and the Weapons Seeker Sciences Branch (RWGS.)</p>
<p><strong>ORDNANCE DIVISION (RWM)</strong><br />The Ordnance Division (RWM) directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development research of fuzes, damage mechanisms, and energetic materials for air launched munitions for use with a full array of launch platforms including fighter, bomber, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aircraft. RWM consists of the Energetic Materials Branch (RWME), Fuzes Branch (RWMF), Damage Mechanisms Branch (RWMW), and Ordnance Integration Branch (RWMI). RWME operates the High Explosives R&amp;D (HERD) facility which is responsible for the development of energetic materials from concept formulation through pilot plant production for transition into existing or future inventory weapon systems. RWMF is responsible for the research and development of technologies to enable precision burst point control initiation of current and future weapon systems. Examples of precision burst point control include post-impact hard target intelligent fuzing and high-closing rate air-to-air and air-to-ground target imaging and aim point selection. RWMW interests range from fundamental understanding of detonation wave implications for damage mechanism formation (i.e., explosively formed penetrators, stretch long rod penetrators, directed fragments) to shaped charge liner materials processing in the Focused Energy Warheads arena that is striving to reduce warhead size and increase lethality and adaptability for application to surface mobile targets and fixed targets. These interests range from fundamental understanding of material behavior in high rate, high-pressure processes (i.e., strain, erosion, toughness), to enhancement of existing blast/fragment warheads, to R&amp;D of novel kill mechanisms for fixed surface targets, both soft and hardened, in the Unitary Warheads arena. RWMI is responsible for conducting the ordnance level studies to establish the development trade space for the fuze, energetic materials and damage mechanism technologies. RWMI is also responsible for defining the interfaces between these technologies, and integrating and demonstrating various levels of ordnance packages prior to higher level weapon system integration and/or transition.</p>
<p><strong>STRATEGIC PLANNING AND ASSESSMENT DIVISION (RWP)</strong><br />The Strategic Planning and Assessment Division (RWP) is responsible for strategic planning and assessment of lethality, effectiveness, utility of weapon technologies, and evaluation of expected weapon performance by simulation. Strategic planning consists of overall RW investment planning; determining warfighter issues and requirements related to munitions and the transition opportunities for science and technology, and managing the cooperative research, technology transfer, and SBIR programs. RWP directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development in weapon/missile modeling and simulation, basic physics and computational modeling. RWP consists of the Capability Planning Branch (RWPB), the Computational Mechanics Branch (RWPC), and the Lethality and Vulnerability Branch (RWPL).</p>
<p>The descriptions of the technical areas are organized by scientific discipline, and the reader may note some overlap between sections. The following narratives are intended to provide an abbreviated description of the sixteen prospective research areas. These descriptions are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to challenge the reader to create and submit truly creative proposals that have the potential to dramatically shift existing air delivered munitions paradigms. These descriptions furnish specific examples of areas of interest and Directorate focal points associated with these technology areas. However, any submitted white paper or proposal must be grounded in achievable technology goals.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 1 - FLIGHT VEHICLES INTEGRATION RESEARCH (RWAV)</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to perform flight vehicles integration research in the areas of: weapon airframe design, weapon propulsion integration, alternate flight control, miniature weapon design and dispensing technology, precision emplacement, compact power systems for micro air vehicles (MAVs), energy harvesting systems for MAVs, and compressed carriage munition design. Applications include high angle-of-attack missile, air-to-air and air-to-surface weapon airframes, rapid response weapon concepts for use on time-critical targets, hypersonic platform and space operating vehicle weapon integration/dispensing, unmanned combat air vehicle weapon integration/dispensing and micro air vehicle munitions. Other areas of interest include active and passive control of air vehicles through the use of innovative technologies such as adaptive smart structures, micro-electromechanical systems (e.g. micro blowing, synthetic jets), application of weakly ionized gasdynamics (i.e. plasma aerodynamics), and innovative methods for munitions strike performance.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 2 - BIOMIMETIC SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL (RWGI)</strong></p>
<p>Both biological systems and smart munitions are required to collect space, time, and color information from the environment, process it, and make some decision. The decision may be that of detecting, recognizing, tracking, or intercepting an object. The decision may also be that of changing position or direction of motion for vehicle navigation or for better viewing of a target. A clear understanding of how the natural systems collect and process information to make these kinds of decisions may lead to revolutionary seeker concepts for autonomous weapons, as well as other machine vision applications. Thus, RWGI is interested in signal processing and control methods that use natural concepts found in biological systems. Our focus in biomimetics (the science of mimicking biological systems) is on leveraging efforts previously aimed at understanding how life forms collect and process environmental information. We want to use what is understood about the natural seekers to build small and affordable autonomous munitions seekers. As biologically inspired seeker system concepts mature and exploit commercially available technology, the resemblance to the original biological system may diminish or even disappear. This consequence reflects our focus on building affordable, capable seekers for smart munitions. Proposed concepts should support the mission of the Munitions Directorate and Advanced Guidance Division.</p>

<p>RWGI is interested in investigating all aspects of Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) technology as it applies to seekers for conventional guided weapons. Interests range from basic signal/image processing foundations through tower and flight test of advanced real time ATR/host signal processor implementations. ATR systems (and related technologies) designed for use with all relevant weapon system sensors (MMW Radar, SAR, IIR, LADAR, Dual Mode combinations, etc.) are of interest.</p>

<p>RWGG is interested in developing advanced capabilities related to hardware-in-the-loop and digital simulation of guided weapon designs. RWGG exercises simulations to verify weapon performance, with particular emphasis on target acquisition, tracking, and guidance performance during terminal homing. Sensors and algorithms for Strategic and Theater Missile Defense concepts developed under the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and Tactical Munitions subsystems developed within AFRL/RW are evaluated. Weapons tested typically include visible, imaging infrared, millimeter-wave, and/or LADAR seeker subsystems. Emphasis for simulation technology research is placed on advancement of scene projection technologies, real-time target scene generation techniques, target phenomenology methods, simulation architectures, compact range millimeter-wave simulators, wide field-of-view flight motion simulators, and high bandwidth motion simulators.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 5 - ADVANCED SCENE GENERATION (RWGG)</strong></p>
<p>Integral to the development of advanced munitions programs is the capability at AFRL/RW to perform high fidelity simulation-based testing of munitions, components and systems. The current capability to generate synthetic imagery for high fidelity hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) and Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) algorithm testing is based on a toolbox of independent Government and industry tools for predicting threat characteristics, environmental effects, and munitions hardware and software performance. The evolution in complexity and capability of modern weapons systems, however, is leading to demands for higher fidelity and performance from test simulations. In addition, the integrated nature of the modern battlefield requires test simulations to encompass not only the weapon itself, but also a variety of other systems. New scene generation (SG) techniques are needed in the areas of characterization of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and Air Force threats, urban environments, chemical/biological effects, coupling and integration of scene generation software, multiple sensor views, and advanced computing techniques. These SG improvements must be designed to streamline the process for evaluating guided munitions concepts from initial design to final implementation, lowering development costs and shortening time from drawing board to battlefield. The improved testing realism will provide confidence that the munitions will perform as expected under a much wider variety of combat conditions than previously possible.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 6 - LASER RADAR COMPONENT RESEARCH (RWGS)</strong></p>
<p>RWG has an interest in developing the components and systems necessary for imaging and non-imaging laser radar systems. These include, but are not limited to, optical sources, detector systems, beam pointing and beam scanning systems, detection schemes, and discrimination, ranging, and acquisition systems. Interests range from complete systems and devices to basic materials and components. These include the following: Optical Sources: Optical sources of various wavelengths from the visible to the mid-infrared (&lt; 5 microns) are desired. These devices may be diodes, diode or flashlamp-pumped solid-state lasers, or optical parametric oscillators (OPOs). The systems can operate at moderate output powers at pulse repetition rates ranging from a few Hz to greater than 1 MHz. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, novel laser and OPO operating schemes, laser and OPO systems and designs, optical coatings, laser materials, and non-linear materials. Associated technologies, such as diode drive electronics, output power control and stabilization, wavelength tuning and stabilization techniques, rapid pulse generation, optical shutters and Q switches, polarization and phase controllers, and optical coupling techniques are also of interest. Detector systems: Single element and array detectors sensitive in the visible to mid-infrared wavelength range are desired. Rapid rise times (approaching a nanosecond) are desired, as is operability without cryogenic cooling. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, detector systems, detector materials, amplification and biasing electronics, temperature control systems, wavelength selection (filters, gratings, etc.), and readout technologies (for array detectors). Beam pointing and beam scanning systems: Systems that can rapidly steer a laser beam as well as the field of view of the detector are desired. Systems capable of search/track modes and variable fields of view are also desired. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, controlled mirror sets, microlens assemblies, gratings, acousto-optical devices, and liquid crystal devices. Associated technologies such as scanning drives and controllers, beam direction monitoring techniques, and pointing stabilization techniques are also of interest. Detection schemes: Various incoherent and coherent detection schemes are of interest. Such schemes include, but are not limited to, direct detection of reflected radiation, return detection of a modulated signal, detection of laser-induced fluorescence, and detection of raman scattered radiation. Possible methods for coherent detection include amplitude, frequency, phase, or polarization modulation. Discrimination, ranging, and acquisition systems: Systems that can discriminate the signal from the background environment, condition the signal, and store the data are required. These systems should be able to resolve time differences as small as or smaller than a nanosecond, dynamically adjust the gain of any amplification stages, allow variable timing/ranging techniques, and/or minimize range uncertainty. A variety of discrimination techniques are of interest, including nth pulse detection, constant fraction threshold detection, variable threshold detection, and others.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 7 - NAVIGATION AND CONTROL TECHNOLOGY (RWGN)</strong></p>
<p>RWGN is developing global positioning system (GPS) anti-jam technology, geo-referenced alternative to GPS navigation, control algorithms for agile autonomous micro air vehicles and micro munitions, vision-based guidance methodologies, control algorithms for path planning and task assignment of cooperative systems of munitions and air vehicles, track fusion and on-line state estimation methods for fusing target tracks between weapon platforms, methodologies for operators to supervise the time critical control of collections of cooperating air vehicles, small and low cost components for secure low probability of intercept data links on micro weapons, and network topologies and routing algorithms for small to large networks of munitions with line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight links. GPS technologies of interest are anti-jam techniques including spatial (beam forming and/or null steering) and temporal anti-jam technologies, and miniature GPS antenna technologies. Biologically inspired but mathematically rigorous techniques are being pursued for agile and vision-based guidance and control. Cooperative control methodologies currently emphasize integrated path planning and task assignment, hedging for un-modeled (adversarial induced) uncertainty, and information theoretic bounds on performance of cooperative networks. Data link technologies are needed that will yield extreme miniaturization while being compatible with current and future military tactical networks.</p>

<p>The goal of this work is to develop/modify and employ models used to analyze advanced weapon concepts and their related concepts of employment to highlight technologies worthy of consideration for investment. The objective is to apply, modify and/or combine engineering, engagement (one-on-one), mission (few-on-few), systems-of-systems, campaign (many-on-many, military worth), level modeling techniques, tools, and analysis methods as well as virtual and constructive digital simulation which lend themselves to the quick and effective evaluation of advanced weapon concepts. Concepts include, but are not limited to, intercommunicative weapons, novel damage mechanisms, lethal and non-lethal destruct mechanisms, multiple targeting, and time critical delivery. Detailed modeling includes, but is not limited to, sensors, aerodynamics, autopilots, navigation and guidance schemes, propulsion, warheads, fuzes, datalinks, error filters, environment (wind, fog, dust), lethality, vulnerability, and threats. Scenario development and visualization at each level of MS&amp;A is also sought. Research into new simulation toolsets and architectures designed for this purpose will also be considered. Additionally, environmental factors that influence a weapons performance can be considered. This can include but not be limited to urban environments, collaborative simulation environments, scenario generation and infrastructure simulation common to environments that weapons may operate in. Existing tools of interest include, but are not limited to, ESAMS, RADGUNS, MATLAB/Simulink, FLAMES, EADSIM, CFAM, and STORM. White papers and proposals should be designed to demonstrate substantive knowledge in any or all of the specific areas of MS&amp;A. Some or all of the work performed under this BAA Research Area will be performed on-site (e.g. at the Government facility) and security clearances at the SECRET level will be required.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 9 - TARGET VULNERABILITY AND WEAPON EFFECTIVENESS (RWPL)</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to collect data, conduct research, develop/modify and employ responsive modeling tools, target models, and processes as part of AFRL's R&amp;D efforts. These efforts will identify potential vulnerabilities in targets and their subcomponents for conventional or concept weapons to exploit. They will also enable understanding and predictive capability for the effectiveness of inventory, developmental, and conceptual munitions when deployed against targets and critical components. Targets of interest can include but are not limited to mobile, fixed (above and below ground), hard and deeply buried, chem-bio and air-to-air. This research will allow development of new techniques or enhancement of existing techniques to measure and compare weapon effectiveness, collateral damage, and potential collateral hazards. Research will include improvements in our ability to predict and measure component vulnerability and functional defeat allowing assessment of weapon effects that degrade a target's ability to perform its intended functions without necessarily destroying it. It could also include research and modeling of new or conceptual damage mechanisms. Development of new target and associated functional models would improve our abilities to exploit high interest targets or newly discovered vulnerabilities. Research to enhance or develop methodology to account for the target critical equipment/components, and their interconnections, and associated failure logic and failure modes could be required. Tools of interest include, but are not limited to AJEM, ARM, BLASTX, BRL-CAD, Endgame Framework, FastCD, FASTGEN, FATEPEN, IMEA, JWS, MEVA, ORCA, PENCURV, PDAM, STEP, STMG, VALUE, WEAPS, and WinBLAST. White papers and proposals should be designed to demonstrate substantive knowledge in any or all of the specific areas of weapon testing, experimentation and weapon effectiveness and target vulnerability MS&amp;A. Some or all of the work performed under this BAA Research Area will be classified. Approved classified processing capabilities and security clearances at the SECRET level as a minimum will be required.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 10 - WEAPON/TARGET MECHANICS (RWPC)</strong></p>
<p>The performance assessment and development of advanced conventional weapon systems requires the capabilities to model complex weapon/target interaction phenomena and to predict environments produced by impacting, penetrating, and detonating warheads. Modeling may be achieved with simplified engineering models or system/subsystem analysis codes, but the emphasis of this effort is the development and validation of continuum mechanics codes yielding high fidelity weapon and target models. Areas of particular interest include penetration mechanics, high strain rate fracture dynamics and constitutive modeling, modeling the shock survivability of fuze<br />electronic components, predictive models for the change in material properties due to thermal cycling (energetics and electronics), fragmentation, mesoscale modeling (metals and energetics), localized shear band formation, high pressure/high strain rate modeling of geologic and geologically derived materials, modeling of reacting droplet and particulate flows, equation of state and constitutive models for chemical and biological agents, numerical modeling of neutralization mechanisms for biological and<br />chemical agents, hydrodynamic ram, atomization and aerosolization of chemical and biological agents, direct numerical simulation of detonations, coupled detonation physics and multi-phase flow, accurate and efficient boundary interface treatments, the ability to span several orders of magnitude in spatial and temporal length scales, and advanced numerical methods. Innovative theoretical, computational and experimental projects that specifically address the problems of interest and result in an improved predictive capability are the goal.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 11 - DAMAGE MECHANISMS RESEARCH (RWMW)</strong></p>
<p>RWMW is interested in all aspects conventional munitions warhead technology as it relates to the destruction, damage, defeat, or denial of function. Technologies and concepts are sought for a robust and affordable capability of air-launched munitions in the areas of: hard and deeply buried targets, fixed ground targets, mobile ground vehicles, air dominance, chemical/biological/radiological/nuclear/explosive (CBRNE) neutralization or access denial, and cybernet neutralization. Additionally, there is interest in specialized diagnostics, techniques, and experimental methods for the development and validation of these capabilities. Technical interests within the Hard Target Effects technical competency are in penetration mechanics, materials for surviving high speed penetration of geologic and cementitious materials, abrasion resistance, terradynamic stability, innovative case structures and composites, and production methods. Fundamental science studies in high rate particulate flow and meso-scale modeling is an area of emphasis. The Damage Effects technical competency has interests in miniature and micro warheads, multifunctional energetic materials and damage mechanisms, directional control and focused effects, selectable effects, and collateral damage control. Approaches in all of these areas are not to be limited to traditional nor classical blast-fragmentation effects. Novel concepts of target defeat are encouraged to augment or replace the more traditional kinetic energy methods.</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 12 - FUZE RESEARCH (RWMF)<br /></strong><br />RWMF develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies that have application to fuzes for air-delivered weapons, including, but not limited to, guided and unguided bombs, missiles, and submunitions. Fuzes must reliably remain in a safe mode until the appropriate post-deployment environments (such as freefall) are sensed; the fuze must then arm the weapon and, upon receiving a signal from a target detection device (TDD), initiate the explosive fill (or other damage mechanism). RWMF thus seeks proposals for innovative technologies that can be integrated into the design or testing of air-delivered weapon fuzes.<br />RWMF is particularly interested in fuzes (including submunition fuzes) and related technologies that are capable of surviving the repetitive, multi-axis shock environment experienced by a fuze during penetration of a hardened target and functioning the warhead through cockpit-selectable time delay functions and advanced post-impact environmental sensing. However, current test technologies do not fully duplicate the multi-axial fuze environment in terms of duration, repetitive high-acceleration loading, and other aspects of the mechanical loading profile. This necessitates extremely expensive sled tests for fuze research, testing, qualification, and performance evaluation. Therefore, a need exists for laboratory and field test techniques and equipment to duplicate these repetitive, multi-axial shocks.<br />Some additional penetration fuzing-specific research tasks of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:<br />- Develop a jam-resistant, greater than 250 kilobits/second shock-hardened wireless Data Link for two-way communication with a fuze during a weapon's deep underground penetration event;<br />- Investigate methods/techniques for improving the shock survivability of inventory hardened fuzes (FMU-143, FMU-152) used in penetrating weapons; e.g., techniques for eliminating gaps/air voids between the fuze and fuzewell;<br />- Develop a hardened, passive, unpowered, tri-axial device that irreversibly and measurably changes some physical configuration or property without relaxation/hysteresis to record the peak acceleration as a back-up data point for tests when a hardened fuze data recorder fails;<br />- Develop a low-cost (&lt;$100), shock-hardened accelerometer;<br />- Develop non-inertial techniques and appropriate devices for detecting voids and layers during hard target penetration; and<br />- Develop a miniature passive or active sensor capable of identifying case breakup and/or severe trajectory instability during a hardened penetration event for the purpose of salvaging the fuze function and high explosive detonation-this technology must operate inside an existing fuze well as an add-on to existing fuze components and have low false alarm rate.<br />RWMF is also interested in improved sensors, techniques, and/or systems for second safety environment sensing for gravity released general-purpose bombs. For example, an improvement or replacement for the FZU-32, -48, etc., would be of significant interest. <br />In the area of miniature and micro-munition fuzing, research tasks of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:<br />- Reliable miniature three port air valve that has a wide temperature operating range (-55 to +75 degree C) <br />- Ground profiling fuze sensor technology<br />- Active imaging aimpoint selecting fuze sensor technology<br />The final area of focused interest is in the area of in-line and out-of-line initiation systems. RWMF Initiation Science and Technology group is interested in novel ignition devices or ignition circuitry that can enhance reliability while reducing energy budgets for initiation systems. Additionally, concepts that would enable novel warhead designs are of interest. We are also interested in novel or more inherently robust manufacturing processes that can be applied to components within initiation systems. Finally, there is interest in methods or techniques for characterizing performance of those systems.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 13 - ADVANCED ENERGETICS (RWME)</strong></p>
<p>Advanced energetics research proposals are of particular interest. This topic includes development of more energetic materials and/or combinations of materials including nanometric explosives as well as other high energy density materials. Reactive materials comprising metastable interstitial composites (MICs) and/or metal fuels in combination with oxidizers and explosives are also included. Constitutive modeling of these materials, including mesoscale descriptions of their dynamic mechanical response, initiation mechanisms and reactive equations of state are included as well. Novel approaches for formulating, processing, enhancing the mechanical properties (i.e., strength, toughness) and characterizing the special features of novel energetic materials and functionally graded materials in terms of their performance and energy release benefits are also of interest.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 14 - FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT ENABLING MICRO MUNITIONS AND ADVANCED ENERGETICS (RWME)</strong></p>
<p>AFRL/RW anticipates a need for new, improved, and often unique facilities and equipment to support expanding future in-house RDT&amp;E (research, development, test, and evaluation) work especially in the areas of micro munitions and advanced energetic. This work will require facilities with the capability to work with energetic nano materials that may also be classified as an explosive. These new RW facilities and equipment will enable world class research, development, integration, fabrication and testing of future prototype munitions system concepts demonstrating emerging micro munition and advanced energetics technologies. Developing concepts and preliminary designs for these new and unique facilities as well as for much of the new equipment to be used in these facilities will need to be approached as research and development projects, not as just design projects. New control/monitoring techniques and equipment will be required to simultaneously meet HVAC requirements for working with nano materials that are also an explosive especially in areas where a clean room environment is required. Of particular interest are proposals for preliminary feasibility studies; concept development, assessment, evaluation, preliminary design and associated cost estimates/presentation material for the new facilities and/or new research equipment that will be required to pursue this evolution of energetics from conventional explosives to reactive materials and nano energetics and munitions from the current conventional munitions to micro munitions. Also of interest are proposals for structural response calculations/modeling, design analysis, and design needed to support Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) submittals/presentations required for explosives siting approval of new facilities to be located at one of RW's remote explosives locations. This topic includes work to advance the understanding of nano energetic material effects on both the human body and the environment as well as work relating to the understanding, interpretation, and assessment of present and likely future applicable environmental, safety, and health requirements/regulations that would relate to nano energetics. A need is anticipated for developing new systems/components that will enable the new facilities and equipment to meet these emerging future requirements/regulations.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 15 - Multi-function Multi-mode RADAR RESEARCH (RWGS)</strong></p>
<p>RWG has an interest in developing innovative multifunction radar systems that lend themselves to a variety of applications for both munitions and Combat UAV's. There is a need for generating multi mode seeker systems where RF is one of the modes that can provide the weather capability and be amalgamated innovatively with IR, EO or Ladar modes in order to provide improved ATR and aim point selection to the munitions seeker system. There is also the interest of creating small munitions seeker and sensor technologies that would provide low cost solutions for creating submunitions seekers. These seekers are to be integrated into a 20 pound munitions full-up-round, for creating smart guided submunitions that can be incorporated into a larger cluster munition for dispensing in a target rich environment. These submunitions require weather capability, and innovative miniature RF solutions are of great interest. There is also interest in developing a Noise/ LPI radar seeker that can provide the capability of not being detected. These seekers must provide the function of detecting, acquiring, tracking, and engaging targets with a very small probability of being detected. The interest also extends to hypersonic and high speed environments. The high speed environment provides interesting requirements that provide great opportunities for innovations in materials implementation, apertures, component technologies and processing. RWG is also interested in dome technology and dome materials for these high speed applications. Concepts and innovative ideas for solutions to these different seeker applications are also of interest. The various seeker applications listed above have many implications of RF components, aperture technology ( conformal, broadband, electronically steered, mechanically steered, concentric apertures), real time processing, miniaturization of subsystems, etc. Signal processing techniques for these various seeker technology described, and the ability to detect, track, and engage targets is of interest. The seeker systems listed above are also expected to provide good measurements for the purpose of guiding the munitions, or CUAC to the intended target. Along with this is the ability to provide measurements or information for the use of classifying the target once reacquired. Another interest is in the seeker system being able to provide fuzing information that would lend itself for an innovative approach for Guidance integrated Fuzing (GIF) applications.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 16 - REVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH (RW)</strong></p>
<p>This research area is intended to cover, in general nature, all revolutionary research areas of interest to this Directorate. AFRL/RW is interested in revolutionary munitions-related research that has the potential to create new<br />airframe, ordnance, and guidance and control technology weapon paradigms. One of the goals of this program is to develop highly innovative solutions relating to munitions ordnance packages and airframe technology for the purpose of defeating a variety of targets including fixed and moving targets, hard and soft targets, and above ground and deeply buried targets. Ideas and concepts are sought that represent new approaches - lethal and non-lethal - to defeat these targets. With this type of revolutionary thinking, as opposed to evolutionary, order of magnitude increases in performance may be realized.</p>
<p>The military payoff would be in terms of significant munitions weight and size<br />reduction, reduced weapon cost, and improved effectiveness. Non-lethal<br />approaches also have the benefit of disabling enemy capabilities with reduced<br />loss of life.</p>
<p>Another goal of this research area is to develop highly innovative concepts and approaches in guidance and control technologies for air-deliverable autonomous munitions. This program may develop advanced concepts in such areas as electro-optical, infrared, millimeter wave, and radio frequency seeker technology with the components and signal/image processing systems used in such seekers. Advanced concepts in the guidance, navigation and control (GN&amp;C) of munitions airframes will also be sought. The basic seeker technologies to be considered include: sensing materials, sensing elements for target characterization, autonomous target acquisition algorithms, signal and image processing algorithms, and multi-sensor data fusion algorithms. The basic GN&amp;C technologies include: miniature inertial measurement units (IMUs), Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, jam resistant GPS, and micro-electro-mechanical system based sensing and control cooperative attack algorithms. In addition to advancements in the basic technology, revolutionary changes that shift current or create new guidance and control paradigms will be developed.</p>

<p><strong>V. WHITE PAPER REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Criteria:</strong> The following four criteria and an assessment of risk will be used to determine whether full proposals will be invited based on the white paper submitted. The Government reserves the right to select all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds. These criteria and proposal risk for schedule discussed in paragraph 2 below will also be used to evaluate formal proposals, should they be requested.</p>
<p>The following factors are listed in descending order of importance. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.</p>
<p><strong>1. Evaluation Criteria:<br /></strong><br />a. An integrated assessment of the proposed technical approach to include scientific and/or technical merits and the potential contributions of the effort to extending the scientific understanding associated with the technologies being pursued by the four AFRL/RW Divisions and described in the 16 research areas. <br />b. The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposed project objectives presented in the white paper/formal proposal. <br />c. The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposed project objectives presented in the white paper/formal proposal. <br />d. The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror if any, and the availability of funds (i.e., considering budgets and funding). Cost/Price is a substantial factor but is ranked as the fourth order of priority.</p>
<p><strong>2. Proposal Risk Assessment:</strong> Proposal risk for technical and cost will be assessed for white papers and formal proposals, should they be requested, as part of the evaluation of the above evaluation criteria. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential scientific benefit. Additionally for formal proposals, proposal risk for schedule will be evaluated. This relates to an assessment of the risks associated with the offeror's proposed number of hours, labor categories, materials, or other cost elements as it relates to meeting the proposed period of performance.</p>
<p>Individual white papers will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers submitted under this BAA. White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>It is the policy of AFRL/RW to treat all white papers as privileged information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. White papers will be subject to an evaluation by highly qualified Government scientists. The offeror must appropriately indicate any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the white paper (see also paragraph IV.B. above). Should white papers be selected and full proposals requested, the proposal is subject to incorporation into a resulting contract and is therefore releaseable under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) unless specifically exempt or portions of the proposal are exempt under FOIA .</p>
<p><strong>B. Review and Selection Process:</strong> The evaluation described above will generally result in white papers being placed in one of the three categories below:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Category I:</span></strong> Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the AFRL/RW technology research areas, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2. Category II</strong></span>: Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Category III:</span></strong> Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.</p>
<p><strong>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Award Notices (White Papers):</strong> Offerors of those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the Contracting Officer. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting offeror will be awarded a contract. Offerors of those white papers not selected for further consideration will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>Offerors may request status of their white paper no earlier than 45 calendar days after submission.</p>
<p><strong>B. Award Notices (full proposals):</strong> Offerors will be notified whether their proposal is recommended for award after evaluation of the proposal. The notification is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award.</p>
<p><strong>C. Administrative and National Policy Requirements:</strong> Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a classified facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to information at the equivalent level of security at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p><strong>D. Reporting:</strong> Contractors should expect any contract or assistance instrument resulting from this BAA would contain the requirement to provide various types of periodic and final technical reports, and possibly cost and other reports.</p>
<p><strong>E. Data Rights Assertions:</strong> It is anticipated that all data delivered under any resulting award will be delivered with unlimited rights; however different rights may be negotiated as appropriate. The contractor shall identify data rights assertions, licenses, patents, etc. that apply to any proprietary materials, technical data, products, software, or processes to be used by the prime or subcontractor(s) in the performance of this program; and shall address acquisition of data rights or licenses, or expected recoupment of development costs for those proprietary items that will be integral to any contracts awarded under this BAA.

<p><strong>VIII. OTHER INFORMATION PERTINENT TO AWARD OF CONTRACTS AND/OR ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Support Contractors:</strong> Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The AFRL Munitions Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: <br />1. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files;<br />2. Accessing library files for use by Government personnel; and<br />3. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.<br />Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p><strong>B. Communication:</strong> Dialogue between prospective offerors and Government representatives is encouraged until submission of proposals. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p><strong>C. Debriefings:</strong> Contractors whose white papers or proposals are not selected for further consideration/award, may request a debriefing. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016).</p>
<p><strong>D. Wide Area Work Flow Notice</strong>: Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. The clause cites three possible electronic formats through which to submit electronic payment requests. Effective 1 October 2006, the Department of Defense adopted Wide Area Work Flow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA), as the electronic format for submission of electronic payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system. Information regarding WAWF-RA, including the web-based training and registration, can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil/ . Note: WAWF-RA requirement does not apply to universities that are audited by an agency other than DCAA.</p>
<p><strong>E. Item Identification and Valuation:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Aug 2008) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the Government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "the Government's unit acquisition cost is the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the Government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the Government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee.). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/sitemap.html .</p>
<p><strong>F. Forward Pricing Rate Agreements:</strong> If formal proposals are requested, offerors who have Forward Pricing Rate Agreements (FPRAs) and Forward Pricing Rate Recommendations (FPRRs) should submit them with their proposals.</p>
<p><strong>G. Pre-Award Clearance:</strong> Pursuant to FAR 22.805, a pre-award clearance must be obtained from the U.S. Department Of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Office Of Federal Contract Compliance Program's (OFCCP) prior to award of a contract (or subcontract) of $10,000,000 or more unless the contractor is listed in OFCCP's National Preaward Registry http://www.dol-esa.gov/preaward. This registry indicates that the contractor has been found to be "in compliance" within the past 2 years with the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) regulations that the OFCCP is mandated to enforce. The registry is updated nightly and facilities reviewed more than 2 years ago are removed and new ones are added. Award may be delayed if you are not currently listed in the registry and the contracting officer must request a pre-award clearance from the OFCCP.</p>
<p><strong>H. Excessive Pass-Through Charges:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.215-7004, Excessive Pass-Through Charges, (May 2008) which requires the contractor to identify in its proposal the percentage of effort to be performed by the prime contractor and the percentage expected to be performed by each subcontractor. If the contractor intends to subcontract more than 70% of the total cost of work under the contract or task order, then it shall identify the amount of the contractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the contractor. If any subcontractor intends to subcontract to a lower tier subcontractor more than 70% of the total cost of its work, then it shall identify the amount of the subcontractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the lower tier subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the subcontractor. <br /><br /><strong>I. Associate Contractor Agreements:</strong> Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) are agreements between contractors working on Government contract projects that specify requirements for them to share information, data, technical knowledge, expertise, or resources. The Contracting Officer may require ACAs when contractors working on separate Government contracts must cooperate, share resources or otherwise jointly participate in working on contracts or projects. Prime contractor to subcontractor relationships do not constitute ACAs. For each award, the Contracting Officer will identify associate contractors with whom agreements are required.</p>
<p><strong>J. Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation:</strong> As prescribed in FAR 19.308, FAR Clause 52.219-28, "Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation (Apr 2009)," is incorporated by reference in this solicitation. This clause will be contained in any contracts resulting from this solicitation. This clause requires a contractor to rerepresent its size status when certain conditions apply. The clause provides detail on when the rerepresentation must be complete and what the contractor must do when a rerepresentation is required. <br /><br /><strong>K. Enabling Clause:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at AFMCFARS 5352.215-9008, Enabling Clause between Prime Contractors and Service Contractors, (Jul 1997), substantially as written, in Section I when a prime contractor must agree to cooperate with a support contractor during the performance of this contract.</p>

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p><br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br>(i) Technical Capability: The item(s) offered will be evaluated as providing or complying with all the requirements set forth in the solicitation specifications.  This evaluation will result in a determination of technical acceptability or unacceptability.  Exceeding the technical requirements will not result in a more favorable evaluation since the overall technical evaluation will be Pass/Fail.<br><br>(ii) Price: Offerors are advised to provide the most competitive pricing they can with the initial proposal submission.<br><br>(iii) Past performance:  Offerors must submit three (3) examples of past performance.  The examples shall have been performed within the past three years (3 yr).  Past performance examples will be evaluated for Relevance and Quality.  <br><br>(A)  Relevance is defined as fulfilling the same or similar requirement for the same or similar quantities under the same or similar circumstances.  An example which is considered to be ideally on-point is one which satisfied the same technical requirement for the same quantity, provided to a Government customer, and within the same delivery timeframe as required under this solicitation.   It is not required to submit examples which are ideally on-point; however, offerors should strive to provide those examples which are as relevant as possible. <br>         <br>(B)  Quality is evaluated as overall customer satisfaction, including but not limited to:  performance of the equipment and services provided; timeliness of delivery;  willingness to negotiate and accommodate changes;  cost control;  processing of warranty claims;  performance of maintenance agreements;  availability of general customer support.  <br><br>(C)   Three (3) examples of past performance shall be included in the offeror's proposal.  Each example shall have the following information:<br><br>Government Agency or Company Name and Address<br>Customer Point of Contact (POC) and Position within the Company/Agency<br>Customer POC telephone number.<br>Customer POC Verified E-mail Address<br>Contract or Sales Number<br>Date of Contract or Sale <br>Dollar Value of Contract<br>Place of Performance<br>Period of Performance<br>Description of Equipment Provided<br><br>(D)   Should the offeror provide more than three (3) examples of past performance, the Government is not obligated to contact more than the first three.  Offerors should confirm that the POC telephone numbers are accurate and in service; failure to provide valid telephone numbers does not obligate the Government to further pursue those examples of past performance.  <br><br>(E)   In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.<br><br>(F)   Nothing in this solicitation prohibits the Government from obtaining and considering past performance from any source available.<br><br>(G)   Negative information obtained during past performance evaluations will be provided to the offeror to be addressed unless such negative information or circumstances have already been addressed by the offeror.  <br><br>(iv) Delivery: Offeror shall propose shortest lead time possible and meet or exceed the required delivery schedule of 300 cases delivered per month until all 1,181 cases are delivered in total with the first required delivery to be within 30 days after date of contract award.  Contractor must propose specific delivery time as part of the offer.  Delivery is FOB Destination, Tobyhanna Army Depot, Tobyhanna, PA  18466.  Early and partial shipments will be accepted.  Transit Cases should be protected from damage during shipment.  <br>Technical, past performance, and delivery, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. AWARD MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE MADE TO THE FIRM WHO SUBMITS THE LOWEST PRICED PROPOSAL. In the case of equal ratings of past performances, proposed delivery schedule, and technical evaluation, price will be the deciding factor for award.  <br>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br>	(End of Provision)<br>

GOOD: The proposal demonstrates a good understanding of the requirements and the approach exceeds performance or capability standards.  The proposal has one or more strengths that will benefit the government.  Any proposal weakness has little potential to cause a disruption of schedule, an increase in cost, or a degradation of performance.

SATISFACTORY: The proposal demonstrates an acceptable understanding of the requirements and the approach meets performance or capability standards.  The proposal has no strengths that will benefit the government.  The proposal has no material weaknesses.

MARGINAL: The proposal demonstrates a limited understanding of the requirements and the approach only marginally meets performance or capability standards necessary for minimal contract performance.  The proposal has minor omissions and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirement that may be corrected or resolved through discussions without a complete revision of the proposal.

UNSATISFACTORY: The proposal demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirements and the approach fails to meet performance or capability standards.  The proposal has major omissions and inadequate detail to assure the evaluators that the offeror has an understanding of the requirements.  The proposal proposes an unacceptable risk and cannot meet the requirements without major revisions.
NEUTRAL: (Applies only to Factor III  Past Performance) The offeror lacks a record of relevant or available past performance history.  Based on this, there is no expectation of either successful or unsuccessful performance.(end of rating scale)

Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton Patient Centered Medical Home 
Performance Work Statement


1.0 	Background.
          	The mission statement and 2012 Command Goals of Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton include: 

1.1	Mission.
To Train, to Deploy and to Deliver Quality Health Care

1.2	Command Goals.
Loyalty and Customer Satisfaction

2.0 	Objectives.
Provide and administer a valid and reliable change assessment tool (e.g.
 a survey) specifically designed and tested in the primary care and graduate medical education environment to assess readiness for change from a traditional model of primary care practice to a new model of Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH). Survey shall be designed to reach a minimum of 300 participants. This contract is pursuant to contract advisory and assistance services (CAAS) in the functional area of Medical Systems Design and Management. Controlling authorities include the Department of Defense Directives and Instructions in the 5000 Series with a project area of functional integration. This objective includes programmatic nonperson services to include analyses, studies, evaluation, investigation and assessments.
  

PCMH is defined as by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as:

The medical home model holds promise as a way to improve health care in America by transforming how primary care is organized and delivered. Building on the work of a large and growing community, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) defines a medical home not simply as a place but as a model of the organization of primary care that delivers the core functions of primary health care. 
The medical home encompasses five functions and attributes: 

A. Comprehensive Care
The primary care medical home is accountable for meeting the large majority of each patients physical and mental health care needs, including prevention and wellness, acute care, and chronic care.
 Providing comprehensive care requires a team of care providers. This team might include physicians, advanced practice nurses, physician assistants, nurses, pharmacists, nutritionists, social workers, educators, and care coordinators. Although some medical home practices may bring together large and diverse teams of care providers to meet the needs of their patients, many others, including smaller practices, will build virtual teams linking themselves and their patients to providers and services in their communities. 
More about Comprehensive Care 

B. Patient-Centered
The primary care medical home provides primary health care that is relationship-based with an orientation toward the whole person.
 Partnering with patients and their families requires understanding and respecting each patients unique needs, culture, values, and preferences. The medical home practice actively supports patients in learning to manage and organize their own care at the level the patient chooses. Recognizing that patients and families are core members of the care team, medical home practices ensure that they are fully informed partners in establishing care plans. 
More about Patient-Centered Care 

C. Coordinated Care
The primary care medical home coordinates care across all elements of the broader health care system, including specialty care, hospitals, home health care, and community services and supports.
 Such coordination is particularly critical during transitions between sites of care, such as when patients are being discharged from the hospital. Medical home practices also excel at building clear and open communication among patients and families, the medical home, and members of the broader care team. 
D. Accessible Services
The primary care medical home delivers accessible services with shorter waiting times for urgent needs, enhanced in-person hours, around-the-clock telephone or electronic access to a member of the care team, and alternative methods of communication such as email and telephone care. The medical home practice is responsive to patients preferences regarding access. 
More about Accessible Services 

E.
 Quality and Safety
The primary care medical home demonstrates a commitment to quality and quality improvement by ongoing engagement in activities such as using evidence-based medicine and clinical decision-support tools to guide shared decision making with patients and families, engaging in performance measurement and improvement, measuring and responding to patient experiences and patient satisfaction, and practicing population health management. Sharing robust quality and safety data and improvement activities publicly is also an important marker of a system-level commitment to quality.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION NOTICE</span>&nbsp; <br /><br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Office of Technology Innovation and Acquisition (OTIA) has a requirement to upgrade Remote Video Surveillance Systems (RVSS) along the Southwest Border of the United States. This solicitation is for the procurement of fully integrated non-developmental Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS) Upgrades that encompass open system architecture to be used by United States Border Patrol (USBP) Agents. DHS/CBP is NOT interested in any kind of a system development.
<p>The currently existing RVSS utilizes multiple color cameras and thermal infrared detection video cameras and ancillary equipment, which are integrated into a remotely controlled system that can monitor and record activity within an Area of Responsibility (AoR) during both daytime and nighttime operations. The RVSS sensor images are transmitted via a dedicated communications sub-system to a Border Patrol Station where the information is processed, displayed, and where the USBP agent can monitor and control the system.&nbsp; <br /><br />The RVSS Upgrade requirement consists of two parallel activities: (1) upgrade selected RVSS sites with newer capability and (2) install upgraded technology at new sites. <br /><br />CBP/OTIA intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) single award contract. The contract will be awarded for an initial site upgrade in the State of Arizona. Upon successful completion and Government acceptance of the initial site installation, the Government may at its option, exercise additional station AOR installs within Arizona and the state of Texas. Operation and maintenance of all sites is also contemplated under this contract. The period of performance of this contract is anticipated to be ten years after contract award.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />VIRTUAL READING ROOM <br /></span><br />Information which may be vital to the offeror's proposal preparation can be found in the RVSS Virtual Reading Room available at www.fbo.gov under pre-solicitation number HSBP1012R0027.

<p>This is a Brand Name or Equal purchase description. Offerors may propose a product in lieu of the brand named item, whereas the replacement product meets or exceeds the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics of the brand name item. See attachment for salient characteristics of the labels and ribbons.</p>
<p>Duration of any resultant contract is a base period of 1 year and two 1 year option periods for a total maximum of 3 years.</p>
<p>Base period is from date of award through one year. Option periods if exercised will start the day after the previous period expires. Maximum total of time is 3 years. <br /><br />This requirement is 100% set aside for small business.</p>
<p>NAICS code is 323119 and the size standard is 500 Employees The resulting contract and orders issued will be firm-fixed price.</p>
<p>An Indefinite Quantity, Indefinite Delivery Contract will be issued from this RFQ. <br />The Government minimum per Base or Option Period is $75,000.00 The maximum amount per Base or Option period is $800,000.00. The minimum per task order is $500.00. The maximum per task order issued is $200,000.00. Government anticipates an initial provisioning order during the base period to be shipped to all sites listed. After this initial shipment the Government will issue orders to replenish specific sites on an as needed basis. Shipping costs are to be included in the unit price.</p>
<p>Required delivery Timeframes:</p>
<p>1. Within Continental US: 30 days after receipt of delivery order<br />2. Outside Continental US: 45 days after receipt of delivery order</p>
<p>Expedited Delivery (lines 0004, 0005, 1004, 1005, 2004, 2005)<br />These lines are used when the Government requires expedited delivery for items in the contract. Lines 0004, 1004 and 2004 are for sites within the continental US (CONUS) on a per site basis and lines 0005, 1005 and 2005 are for Outside CONUS sites on a per site basis. Normal delivery timeframes are 30 days CONUS and 45 days OCONUS. Expedited delivery timeframes are 10 days CONUS and 30 days OCONUS. If an order is expedited all delivery sites listed on that order are expedited and an expedite line would need to be ordered for each site listed Example: If two sites were on an order for CONUS that needed to be expedited during the Base Period , then 2 EA of Line 0004 would be ordered and the delivery timeframe would be 10 days after receipt of order for that order. Pricing for the expedited lines should reflect the additional costs of delivering the items to the site within the expedited period. Regular shipping costs for normal delivery timeframes should already be included in the unit price of items 0001, 1001, 2001, 0002, 1002, 2002, 0003, 1003, 2003.</p>
<p>Government will award this requirement to the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable offer. The Government's objective is to obtain technically acceptable barcode ribbons and labels from an offeror who is experienced in providing these products worldwide to multiple delivery locations</p>
<p>Ship to address: 120 locations worldwide. See attached location Spreadsheet.<br />Items shipped must include the Contract and Task Order numbers in the shipping documentation for each location.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

 JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION TO SOLE SOURCE REQUIREMENT

REQUIRED INFORMATION
1.     FACILITY NUMBER-NAME-CITY, STATE:  Iowa City VA Healthcare System, Iowa City, IA Station # 636A8 (584)
2.     VISN OR PROGRAM ACTIVITY:  23
3.     POC NAME AND TELEPHONE NUMBER:  Katherine Beardsley, 319-338-0581, x6807
4.     PROPOSED ACTION:  Sole Source Procurement of SERVICE
5.     DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:  Service contract for preventive and emergency maintenance, including parts, software updates and technical support, of Siemens Sensis Hemodynamic Monitoring System at the Iowa City VA Healthcare System.

"	Supplies/Equipment:  Technical characteristics can include, but are not limited to model, make, part number, color, size, quantity, delivery date, etc.  Services:  Refer to the statement of work, statement of objective, or performance work statement for your description.

6.     STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:  Only One Responsible Source Available

"	FAR 6.302-1  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements
"	FAR 8.405-6  Limited sources justification and approval
"	FAR 13.106-1(B) SAP Requirements - Soliciting From a Single Source


"	This is a reference to the part of the Federal Acquisition Regulation that allows an item to be purchased without being fully competed.  This statement serves as a point of reference in case the justification is questioned.  In this case, it would be reviewed for its relativity to this part of the Federal Acquisition Regulation

7.     NATURE & BACKGROUND OF ACQUISITION TO JUSTIFY SOLE SOURCE:  This system has proprietary software that is accessible for off-site troubleshooting through a VA National Site to Site VPN connection.  These connections must be approved by national ISO's and the companies trying to make these connections must have certain levels of security clearance.  There are also proprietary software keys used for troubleshooting that are accessible to Siemens/Cassling personnel only.  Estimated cost is $7,690.00 from date of award through 9/30/12. 

"	Describe the minimum salient characteristics that will meet your needs.  This is the area where you explain why no other vendor anywhere can supply this requirement for you.  Acceptable reasons for "sole source" include (but are not limited to):  bound by contract, technical order specification, warranty service, or regional standardization.  If the reason for sole source is determined locally, offer what market research or clinical guidelines led to the decision.  If this item is included in an allowance standard for War Reserve Materiel  (WRM), cite the allowance standard, required source, and stock number for this item.  NOTE FOR WRM PURCHASES:  The Defense Logistics Agency is your primary source for WRM equipment.  Be sure to determine availability from a DLA item manager before contracting for WRM equipment.  If DLA cannot meet your timelines for WRM equipment, your urgency may be further justification for other than full and open competition.  See your Medical Logistics Flight Commander for more details.

8.     PROVIDE INFORMATION SHOWING MARKET RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED:  To my knowledge, there are no other companies that are able to offer this service due to the unavailability of software maintenance access, and the level of security clearance and approvals needed for the VPN connection.  Other vendors could potentially provide the on-site support, but not the remote diagnostics.

"	This justification is for why no other vendor anywhere can supply your item or service and still meet your    needs.  Your rationale for barring other vendors is crucial to your justification.  If you already cited the statutory reasons for a sole source, state, "See paragraph 7".  If your rationale for a sole source purchase was  determined locally, offer an explanation of the source selection process you went through to determine your   sole source requirement.  Unacceptable reasons include (but are not limited to) personal taste, good relationship with existing vendor, or one's comfort level with a particular vendor.

"	Describe the similarities and differences in vendors for the product that you are aware of that could assist or prevent the purchaser from obtaining the best value for you.  Be sure to name the vendors.  This section will  help the purchaser decide which vendors are available to purchase this item from.  If market research was      not conducted, state it AND the reason that there was no market research.

9.     PRICE ANALYSIS "FAIR AND REASONABLE":  The contracting officer will make the determination if price is fair and reasonable.  

"	This section is mandatory.  Do not leave this section blank.  Even though this must be purchased from only one source, you must still obtain a quote from the vendor for this purchase.  This way you are able to verify added costs for    delivery, your geographic region, or installation.  Cite the pricing here.  If you purchased this item before, compare this price to what you paid last time.  Cite this here as well.
10.     LISTING OF SOURCES EXPRESSING INTEREST IN THIS REQUIREMENT:  Cassling Diagnostics/Siemens Medical, POC:  Lori Graff, lgraff@cassling.com, 402-334-5000 x1152

"	Enter or attach contact information for sources you cited in the description of your source selection.  If sole source by statute, regulation, or standard, list contact information for that source here.
11.     FUTURE ACTION TO OVERCOME BARRIER TO OTFOC:  There is no action the VA can take to increase competition for this scenario.  Any potential companies wishing to qualify for this procurement would have to obtain national site to site agreements with VA OI&T.

"	This section fulfills the legal requirement to affirm that the selection of a singular source for this requirement is an anomaly and that action will be taken in the future to ensure full competition in the future.  The reason this is needed is to describe how the government will make an effort in the future to fully comply with the standard acquisition practices and not resort to creating unnecessary partnerships with few vendors at the risk barring full competition to circumvent the FAR.  By signing this, you are telling the contracting officer to avoid the processes that assure best value and fairness in this acquisition.  If the reason for sole source purchase is because of statute, standard, or regulation, enter "THE SOURCE FOR THIS PARTICULAR PURCHASE IS REQUIRED IAW [cite the standard here].

<p>Addenda to 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i) Technical Capabilities<br />a. Experience<br />b. Understanding of the Requirement<br />ii) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capabilities and its sub factors, are significantly more important than price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single Firm Fixed Price contract from this combined synopsis/solicitation. <br />Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior services than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior services. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Technical Capabilities). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES- The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the Offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Proposal. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Parts 7.2 and 7.4 of the SOW.&nbsp; If an offer does not contain adequate information to make this determination, it will be considered&nbsp;non-responsive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PRICE- The Offeror shall provide a document outlining their pricing using the contract line items listed above. Pricing must be provided separately from your technical proposal.</p>
<p>EVALUATION SUMMARY</p>
<p>FACTOR I. TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES-The Offeror shall submit a proposal that acknowledges the tasks identified in the Statement of Work to allow the Government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of performing the work. <br />Sub factor a. EXPERIENCE-The Offeror shall provide a synopsis of their experience in performing the tasks listed in the Statement of Work.<br />Sub factor b. UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT- The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal acknowledging that they are capable of completing the tasks identified in the Statement of Work, outlining their method and approach to completing the requirements.</p>
<p>FACTOR II. - PRICE The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Technical Capabilities follows. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor III, Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:<br />Factor I- Technical Capabilities, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale<br />Outstanding-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Good-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Acceptable-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Unacceptable-A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Non-Price Factors: The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first: <br />Factor I, Technical Capabilities and its sub factors combined are significantly more important than Factor II "Price". However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor II "Price" becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>Vendors who are exempt from the Service Contract Act must certify that the exemption applies using FAR 52.222-41, 52.222-48, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification.</p>
<p>Quotes must be received by Mindy Smith, Contract Specialist, no later than 3:00 PM (EST) on March 7, 2012. Quotes will be accepted by fax at (304) 256-3332 or e-mail at smith.mindy@dol.gov.

<p>(end of provision)</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.</p>
<p>All offerors shall provide a quotation for the following line item:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: One (1) Non-magnetic high resolution tip-tilt positioning stage and controller</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, and equipment to fabricate and deliver a non-magnetic high resolution tip-tilt positioning stage and controller.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>NIST's Radiation and Biomolecular Physics Division has a requirement for a non-magnetic high resolution tip-tilt positioning stage and controller to measure the magnetic dipole moment (MDM) of the neutron using Bragg reflection from two separately polished silicon crystals. One must align the Bragg planes of the crystals to high angular precision (+/- 100 nanoradians). The MDM measurement is sensitive to magnetic field gradients, thus the stage must be composed of non-magnetic materials. If this MDM measurement is successful, we will use the stage in a novel measurement of the neutron EDM, an important quantity in limiting extensions to the standard model of particle physics.</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements</p>
<p>All items must be new. Prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: One (1) non-magnetic high resolution tip-tilt positioning stage and controller, which shall meet or exceed the specifications identified below.</p>
<p>1. The positioning stage shall be driven by a piezoelectric with independent control over the tip, tilt and control of one axis of translation.</p>
<p>2. The positioning stage shall have:<br />a. angular resolution for both the tip and tilt better than 100 nanoradians;<br />b. a tip and tilt repeatability of better than 50 nanoradians;<br />c. tip and tilt angular travel range of at least plus or minus 0.3 mrad;<br />d. linearity better than 0.04 per cent.</p>
<p>3. The positioning stage shall have:<br />a. translation travel of at least 0.05 mm;<br />b. a translation resolution of better than 1nm;<br />c. linearity better than 0.04 per cent;<br />d. a translation repeatability of better than 2 nm.</p>
<p>4. The position sensors for the stage shall be capacitive so as to enable the above specifications.</p>
<p>5. The body of the stage shall be made of a non-magnetic material, and shall not have a magnetic surface coating (such as a Ni-based anodization).</p>
<p>6. Titanium (or other suitable non-magnetic material such as brass or aluminum) shall be substituted for all components fabricated from stainless steel or other magnetic materials (such as Invar).</p>
<p>7. The dimensions of the stage shall be: <br />a. width less than 155 mm;<br />b. height less than 155 mm;<br />c. thickness less than 18 mm.</p>
<p>8. The surface of the stage shall have mounting holes. The stage shall have a clear aperture that is at least 70 mm by 70 mm that is centered in the stage.</p>
<p>9. The stage shall come with a programmable controller. <br />a. The controller software must run natively on Windows XP and Windows 7 operating systems. <br />b. The software for the controller must include Windows dynamic link libraries (DLL) and Labview VIs. <br />c. Options for communication between the controller and a computer must include USB and RS-232. <br />d. The software shall come with a manual describing the programming functions.</p>
<p>10. The cables connecting the controller and the stage shall be at least a total of 10 m in length. If the cables are hardwired to the stage, the cables shall be in two parts; the length of the cables hardwired to the stage must be between 1 m and 2 m in length, terminating in a connector block (for instance, D-sub). A second cable set 8 m to 10 m in length shall connect the controller to the connector. If required to maintain resolution, a sensor readout or amplification stage may be positioned between the extension cable and the hardwired cable.</p>
<p>Express Warranty</p>
<p>Contractor shall provide a standard commercial warranty.</p>
<p>Delivery</p>
<p>FOB Destination delivery terms are requested, and shall take place in accordance with Contractor's commercial schedule. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.</p>

<p>REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>All offerors shall provide a proposed price for the following line items:</p>
<p>LINE ITEM 0001: Helium Refrigerator<br />LINE ITEM 0002: Necessary Spare Parts, Accessories, Maintenance Kits, and Fittings<br />LINE ITEM 0003: Installation, Training, and Delivery</p>
<p>SPECIFICATIONS</p>
<p>Helium Refrigerator</p>
<p>This Helium Refrigerator is to be used at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD USA in the Low Background Infrared (LBIR) facility. The LBIR facility currently has a Linde Model RS helium compressor and a Linde Model RSX helium compressor which are used to provide the input gas to the refrigerator. The requirement must be compatible and able to interface with the existing hardware.</p>
<p>The system shall meet or exceed the technical specifications identified below.</p>
<p>The following specifications for the Helium Refrigerator are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Performance Requirements<br />(a) The helium refrigerator supplied must provide the following refrigeration capacity (shown in the graph below) at the specified compressor helium flow rates at a pressure of 1.8 MPa with 20K helium gas returning from the load to the refrigerator.</p>
<p>Helium Refrigerator Cooling Capacity<br /><br />Grams/second</p>
<p>The upper curve shows the cooling capacity with Liquid Nitrogen pre-cool in use. Liquid Nitrogen use shall not exceed 45 liters per hour to achieve the highest cooling capacity shown. <br />The lower curve shows the cooling capacity without Liquid Nitrogen pre-cool.</p>
<p>(b) This performance must be achieved using the normal pressures and flow rates supplied by our Linde RS and RSX helium compressors. The pressure and flow rate specifications for the compressors are shown below.</p>
<p>RS Compressor</p>
<p>Suction Pressure: 2.5 kPa (10" water)<br />Discharge Pressure: 1.8 MPa (18 Atmospheres)<br />Helium Flow Rate: 18.0 grams per second</p>
<p>RSX Compressor</p>
<p>Suction Pressure: 2.5 kPa (10" water)<br />Discharge Pressure: 1.8 MPa (18 Atmospheres)<br />Helium Flow Rate: 22.2 grams per second</p>
<p>2. Refrigerator Physical Size and Description</p>
<p>(a) The refrigerator supplied must fit entirely within a rectangular cube 1.5m wide by 2m tall by 1.1m deep (front to back). A smaller unit (meeting all specifications) can be supplied, but due to space constraints of the LBIR facility, the unit cannot be larger in any dimension.</p>
<p>(b) The connections for the compressor to refrigerator helium supply and return lines must be by means of commonly available fittings, such as: Standard American tapered pipe threads, Aeroquip refrigerant couplings, Conflat flanges. The connections used must be suitable for the expected operating pressures and flow rates of helium.</p>
<p>(c) The connections for the refrigerator to load (cryogenic) supply and return lines must be by means of vacuum insulated coaxial bayonet fittings designed for minimal heat leakage. Both halves of each bayonet (i.e. the two fittings permanently attached to the refrigerator plus the two removable pieces to be welded to our cryogenic transfer lines) must be supplied with the refrigerator. Two additional removable bayonet fittings must be provided as well, for a total of 4 of these fittings.</p>
<p>(d) The refrigerator supplied must be fully automated using a built-in computer system or built-in Programmable Logic Controller. The system must include a manual and a remote user interface with easily used menu driven controls. The system must also include the capability for remote monitoring and control via a standard computer interface (e.g. RS-232, USB, GPIB, Ethernet). The remote control must include the ability to control all functions of the refrigerator and attached compressors, as well as the ability to read out all temperatures and pressures monitored by the system.</p>
<p>(e) The refrigerator must include a programmable cooling capacity control. This must include the capability to set a specify engine speed (in RPM) or similar setting for other cooling capacity control both via the manual user interface and remotely via a computer interface described in the previous paragraph. The control system may include an automatic mode where the engine speed (or other cooling control parameter) is automatically adjusted to maintain a certain return gas temperature. The control system must include a manual control mode where the engine speed (or other cooling control parameter) can be set to a specific value and maintained at that value. The system must include all components of a functioning speed control system (or cooling capacity control system). A part of the speed control system may be remotely mounted (e.g. a resistor bank used as a load for a speed control system) to move the heat away from the refrigerator. This remotely mounted portion of the speed control is excluded from the size specification shown in the diagram above. In addition to the speed control system, the refrigerator must include an over-speed protection device that will execute an "Emergency Stop" of the system should the system speed become too high. This Emergency Stop must include (at the least) the following functions:</p>
<p>&bull; Immediately close a solenoid operated valve to turn off the pressurized helium supply to the expansion engine.</p>
<p>&bull; Lock-out the refrigerator, requiring operator intervention to clear the lock-out before the refrigerator will operate again.</p>
<p>&bull; Other functions deemed suitable/necessary by the manufacturer for safety reasons.</p>
<p>3. Electrical Interface to compressors and utility requirements</p>
<p>(a) The interface between the Helium refrigerator and our existing compressors is shown below. The diagram shows the interface for one compressor. The refrigerator must have at least two such interfaces to control two compressors.</p>
<p>Refrigerator to Compressor Interface<br /><br />In the diagram above, the signal names on the left represent the six (6) wires from our existing compressor. 120 VAC Line and 120 VAC Neutral are connected to mains voltage at the compressor.</p>
<p>(b) Contact A is a normally closed contact in the refrigerator. Momentarily opening Contact A stops the compressor. This contact should be rated to handle 240 VAC at 7A resistive, 1/3 HP inductive.</p>
<p>(c) Contact B is a normally open contact in the refrigerator. Momentarily closing Contact B will start the compressor. This contact should be rated to handle 240 VAC at 7A resistive, 1/3 HP inductive.</p>
<p>(d) Contact C is a normally open contact in the refrigerator. Momentarily closing Contact C will initiate an "Auto Load" of the RSX Compressor, or will increase the Load of the RS Compressor while the contact is closed. This feature is only used by the operator via the touch screen control panel on the refrigerator. This contact is never operated by the PLC/Computer under any other circumstances. This contact should be rated to handle 240 VAC at 7A resistive, 1/3 HP inductive.</p>
<p>(e) Relay Coil 1 will be energized with 120 VAC when the compressor is running. This serves to let the refrigerator know that the compressor is running.</p>
<p>Electrical Utilities</p>
<p>(f) The refrigerator will operate from 120 VAC 60 Hz at up to 20A.</p>
<p>Other Utilities</p>
<p>Compressed Air at approximately 80 to 100 psi will be available, if needed.</p>
<p>Helium Supply and Storage</p>
<p>(g) The Helium gas for the refrigerator is supplied through the refrigerator. 99.999% pure Helium supply gas at approximately 80 psi will be connected to the refrigerator. The refrigerator must monitor helium pressures on the compressor supply and return sides and maintain these pressures at proper operating levels by either letting additional helium into the compressor return line (either from the 99.999% pure Helium supply or from our existing helium recovery tank, whichever port is at higher pressure), or by bleeding off helium from the compressor high side. This bleed-off gas must be fed to a suitable port on the back of the refrigerator (e.g. Aeroquip refrigerant coupling) which will be connected to our existing helium recovery tank.</p>
<p>Additional Features of the Refrigerator</p>
<p>(h) Initial cleaning of the helium in the system will be performed using our existing external cryogenic adsorber before beginning the cool down. This external adsorber will be taken out of service when the cool down begins. The refrigerator must have at least two (2) internal cryogenic adsorbers, cooled by the refrigerator itself, which will continuously clean the helium refrigerant during operation. Only one adsorber will be used at any given time. The refrigerator must include suitable plumbing to allow unused adsober(s) to be pumped via an external vacuum pump and regenerated using heaters built into the adsorbers. The adsorbers must, therefore, be adequately insulated so as to allow them to be heated to "bake out" temperatures (305K) without adversely affecting refrigerator performance. The refrigerator must include all provisions for switching between internal adsorbers and, if needed, regenerating unused adsorbers. The refrigerator must include suitable temperature controller(s) to control the temperature of the internal adsorbers during regeneration.</p>
<p>Liquid Nitrogen Pre-cooling</p>
<p>(i) When the liquid nitrogen pre-cooling system is used, it shall operate in a steady state manner with no variations in contribution to cooling capacity. This is a substantial departure from the current liquid nitrogen pre-cooling system and will most likely require modifications to the way the plumbing to the liquid nitrogen and liquid nitrogen boil-off heat exchangers is implemented.</p>
<p>Additional temperature sensors</p>
<p>In addition to the temperatures sensors normally installed in a Linde 1620 refrigerator, additional temperature sensors must be included as follows:</p>
<p>(j) A return gas temperature sensor - located inside the vacuum jacket of the refrigerator before any Tee or Valve.</p>
<p>(k) A temp sensor just before and just after E48 (but before Tee to V360)</p>
<p>(l) A complete description of the system must be provided including locations of all temperature and pressure sensors and gauges for approval by NIST.</p>
<p>Warranty<br />The contractor shall warrant the entire system for a period of at least one year. The warranty must include unlimited telephone/e-mail support for questions regarding operation during normal business hours. All costs including parts, labor, travel, and other expenses necessary to repair the system will be borne solely by the contractor at no additional cost to the U.S. Government. Manufacturer's accuracy specifications as verified by test results performed by NIST shall be guaranteed for a period of one year.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance<br />In addition to the inspection and acceptance terms articulated in 52.212-4, the Government reserves the right to perform such performance tests and evaluations as defined below to verify specified system performance. Such tests and evaluations, if performed, shall be conducted within the environment that the system is to be operated. The Contractor has the right to be present during the tests and evaluations, if performed, at the Contractor's expense.</p>
<p>Acceptance testing of the accuracy specifications shall be demonstrated at NIST prior to product acceptance. The manufacturer shall provide, during the period of acceptance testing, the artifacts necessary to demonstrate product conformance to specifications.</p>
<p>Delivery<br />Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. The contractor shall deliver to NIST, Acquisition Management Division, Shipping and Receiving, 100 Bureau Drive, Building 301, Room B129, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001. An authorized representative will accept the item to be provided.</p>
<p>Delivery Time for Helium Refrigerator: 42 weeks After Receipt of Order<br />Delivery Time for Four (4) Removable Bayonet Connectors (see 2(c) above): 4 weeks after Receipt of Order</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: <br />Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>The Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. Government will evaluate proposals based on the following evaluation criteria: Technical Capability and Price.</p>
<p>1. Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the proposal. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements.

Each deliverable is anticipated to be authorized as a need arises at a Firm Fixed Price amount.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to make award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best value to the government. The government will consider three factors: Experience and Technical Qualifications, Past Performance, and Cost/Price. Experience and Technical Qualifications will be more important than Past Performance and Experience and Technical Qualifications and Past Performance, when combined, is significantly more important than cost or price. Only those offerors who are rated as technically acceptable or above will be evaluated on Past Performance and Cost/Price</p>
<p>FACTOR 1: Technical Response</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal will be evaluated to ensure that it demonstrates that the offeror has a sound and thorough understanding of all Tasks in the Statement of work. The offoror's technical response will be evaluated in the descending order of importance.<br />a. The proposed approach to address the work to be performed as described in the attached SOW. Specific experience with and successful implementation of BEC cooling (zero momentum state) is required. <br />b: Recent applicable experience and archived publications related to providing the services described in the Scope of Work<br />&bull; An understanding and experience with sub-doppler cooled alkaline-metal apparatus. Specific experience with and successful implementation of BEC cooling is required and subject to evaluation. <br />&bull; An understanding and experience with the assembly, testing, tuning, and proof of quantum degeneracy in independent study, with less than 10% intrusion on NIST staff. Performer must demonstrate their ability to build an alkali-metal spectroscopy setup, capability to operate any existing alkali-metal spectroscopy setup safely and competently, and ability to build, tune, program, maintain, measure, and document an alkali-metal spectroscopy setup. <br />c. Qualifications of Key Personnel: Offerors should provide information for key personnel that demonstrate type and years of experience related to subsection (b) above and the requirements for subject matter expertise detailed in the SOW.<br />Under this award, the Contractor's Key Personnel will be considered key. During the first 180 days of performance, the Contractor shall make no substitutions of key personnel unless necessitated by illness, death or termination of employment. In accordance with CAR 1352-237-75 KEY PERSONNEL, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer within fifteen working days prior to making substitutions.<br />The key person designated by the contractor is: <br />______________________________</p>
<p>FACTOR 2: Past Performance</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources and archive publications known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken.<br />The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.<br />The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers all available and relevant information.<br />When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.<br />The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance. The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror.</p>
<p>FACTOR 3: Cost/Price</p>
<p>The government will evaluate the proposed rates in the Bid Schedule of this solicitation for best value and completeness. The Government will also evaluate cost and price realism with regard to the ability of the offeror to meet requirements in terms of skills required, complexity of disciplines and job difficulty, if the Government deems such analysis necessary.</p>

<p>CFTC anticipates one award pursuant to this solicitation. The anticipated contract will be time-and-materials and will include one base year and four option years. The anticipated award date is April 1, 2012.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is responsible for regulating commodity futures and options markets in the United States. Congress created the CFTC in 1974 as an independent agency and has renewed and expanded the agency's mandate several times since then. The CFTC's mission is to protect market users and the public from fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices related to the sale of commodity and financial futures and options and to foster open, competitive and financially sound futures and options markets. The CFTC's headquarters is located at 1155 21st Street, NW in Washington, DC. The CFTC also maintains regional offices in New York, NY, Chicago, IL and Kansas City, MO.</p>
<p>The Commission's Office of Data and Technology (ODT) has the responsibility for management of an automated litigation support program called eLaw. To fulfill its mission in a more cost effective manner, the CFTC established Project eLaw for the creation of an automated law office that seamlessly integrates technology and work processes to support Commission managers and staff in their investigative, trial, and appellate work. To support the CFTC staff in the use of these applications, the eLaw program uses Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). A SME in CaseSoft Application Suite and Nexidia ESI is now required to support the eLaw Program.</p>
<p>The CaseSoft Suite (CaseMap, TimeMap, TextMap, and NoteMap) provides functionality that supports matter knowledge organization and evidence analysis. CaseMap, for example, is an investigation and matter analysis tool that allows the user to select key records or passages and analyze them with filters and visual timelines. The CaseSoft Suite is used to convert transcripts, unstructured notes and memos into a matter blueprint with outlines, timelines, issue lists, a roster of people in the matter, and short descriptions of evidence "objects" (a document, an event, or a statement). The information is placed in a database that multiple people can access simultaneously from different locations in preparation for depositions, settlement discussion, and trial.</p>
<p>Nexidia ESI is audio and speech analytics software that phonetically searches voice recordings for key words and phrases. It can search across many thousands of hours of audio recordings and find critical case evidence in a matter of seconds. Nexidia plays the retrieved audio files at the point at which the search term or phrase is heard in the recording. Audio files and associated metadata must be ingested (imported and indexed) by Nexidia ESI in order to make the files searchable. The normalization of metadata to fit Nexidia import requirements is an important step in the ingest process. CFTC's Nexidia configuration consists of one application server, one database server, one ingest server, two indexing servers and two search servers.</p>

<p>3) Provide a brief description of up to three (3) past projects completed or substantially performed during the past three years for which your firm performed services similar to those required by this solicitation. Include reference name, email, and telephone number for each project.</p>
<p>4) Offer fully burdened fixed hourly rates for the base year and for each of the four option years using the Government estimate of 1,860 labor hours per year. The fixed rates must include salary, fringe benefits, overhead, general and administrative expense, profit, and all other indirect costs. The Offeror must also identify and provide a cost estimate for travel and any other proposed direct costs including markup if any for the base and each option year.</p>
<p>Offerors are advised that travel costs should include an estimate for travel to each of the CFTC regional offices shown below. Assume three trips annually to each location with a stay of three full business days during each trip.</p>
<p>New York Office, 140 Broadway <br />Chicago Office, 525 West Monroe Street <br />Kansas City Office, 4900 Main Street:</p>
<p>The offer must include a total cost for the base year and each option year, and a grand total for all years.</p>
<p>ORAL PRESENTATIONS -</p>
<p>After initial review of proposals, CFTC may request oral presentations. If requested, oral presentations will be requested of all vendors determined to have a likelihood of receiving an award. Oral presentations will be provided by the proposed candidates who will be asked to elaborate on their understanding of the scope of work and aspects of their background and qualifications that would contribute to successful performance. The presentation will be allotted up to 30 minutes after which CFTC may also ask questions of the candidates. Oral presentations will be conducted at CFTC offices at 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, DC. <br />EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />Award will be made to the offeror whose offer is deemed to provide the best value to the Government, considering both price and technical evaluation criteria. In considering which offer represents the best value, CFTC will consider the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>(1) Personnel Qualifications - the Government will evaluate information provided in the resumes and, if requested, oral presentations, on the extent to which they demonstrate the likelihood of successful performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(2) Past Performance and Experience - the Government will evaluate the description of past projects and past performance information from references on the extent to which it demonstrates the likelihood of successful performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(3) Price - The evaluated price will be the total proposed cost for the base and four option years.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of the relative importance of price to the technical criteria, the technical criteria, when combined, are significantly more important than price. However, as the merit of technical factors in competing offers approaches equality, price will become increasingly more significant as an evaluation factor.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions. Therefore, offers should contain the best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be desirable.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />1. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE<br />The effort required for this Contract shall primarily be performed on-site at CFTC's facilities but may also be performed in part at the Contractor's facility. For work performed on-site, the primary place of performance shall be CFTC headquarters located at 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, DC. It is anticipated that the Contractor will be required to work on-site at the Washington, DC location at least three weeks of each month. <br />2. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY<br />For work performed on-site at CFTC, the Government will provide all required facilities, equipment and supplies required to perform the scope of work. This includes workstation, computer, telephone and other normal office supplies. The Contractor staff shall comply with the Commission's Information Technology Rules of Behavior and certify in writing their commitment to do so.</p>
<p>3. TRAVEL COSTS<br />Costs for transportation, lodging, meals and incidental expenses incurred by contractor personnel on official business are allowable subject to FAR 31.205-46, Travel Costs. These costs will be considered reasonable and allowable only to the extent that they do not exceed on a daily basis the maximum per diem rates in effect at the time of travel as set forth in the Federal Travel Regulations. CFTC will not provide reimbursement for local travel costs (i.e., to and from CFTC's Headquarters building) for contractors that are located within the Washington, DC metropolitan area. All travel must be approved in writing and in advance by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). <br /><br />4. WORK HOURS<br />The Contractor shall schedule its personnel to ensure that the eLaw Program is sufficiently staffed between regular business hours, typically 8:30am to 5:00pm Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays and emergency closings. It is recognized that some adjustment in work hours will be required from time-to-time to mitigate unforeseen problems, when and if they arise. Contractor personnel shall adhere to a business-casual attire dress code during working hours. Since the Contractor's personnel will have direct contact with CFTC employees at all levels, the Contractor employees must be customer-focused, congenial, and present a pleasant and professional demeanor at all times.<br /><br />5.

In those cases, the replacement procedures established by this clause shall be followed.<br /><br />9. NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION<br />(a) As used in this clause, "confidential information" means information obtained during performance under the contract that is private in nature, and which is not meant for public disclosure. Examples of "confidential information" include, but are not limited to, investigatory materials, sensitive or proprietary business information, software and related documentation provided for the purpose of performance under the contract, and financial or personal information, including but not limited to information that would separately disclose the business transactions or market positions of any person or trade secret or names of customers, as defined in the Commission Regulation 1.3(k) (17 C.F.R. Section 1.3(k)).</p>
<p>(b) Pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. d 1, et. seq.), other laws and the terms and conditions of this contract, the Contractor agrees to use confidential information only for the purposes of performing work under this contract, and to otherwise hold such information confidential. The Contractor shall not directly or indirectly use or allow the use of confidential information for any purpose other than that directly associated with officially assigned duties, and shall not, either by direct action or by counsel, discussion, recommendation, or suggestion to any third party, reveal the nature or content of any confidential information.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall obtain from each employee permitted access a written agreement (see Attachment B), that he/she will not disclose any such confidential information to any third party except those persons within the Contractor's organization or the Government directly concerned with the performance under the contract. The completed form shall be furnished to the Contracting Officer prior to each employee beginning work on under this contract.</p>
<p>(d) If disclosure of confidential information to a third party is determined to be necessary by the Commission, the Contractor shall first obtain written authorization from the Contracting Officer prior to disclosing the confidential information. The Contractor shall continue to comply with this clause after expiration of this contract.</p>
<p>(e) The Contractor shall comply with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. &sect; 552a, and the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), 44 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 3541 et seq., and related regulations, shall use administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect CFTC confidential information from unauthorized access, disclosure and misuse.

The Contractor staff with access to PII shall annually attend the Commission's mandatory privacy and security training program and participate in other CFTC training programs as requested.</p>
<p>(f) In the event of an incident involving the loss, compromise or unauthorized disclosure, real or potential, of PII, the Contractor shall report the incident to the COR immediately and no later than one (1) hour upon discovery of the incident, and if the COR cannot be immediately reached, to the CFTC Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Privacy Officer. The Contractor shall cooperate with CFTC personnel in handling any investigation of the incident and mitigating risks of similar future incidents.</p>
<p>10. PERSONNEL SECURITY<br />A. Personnel suitability/security checks are required only for Contractor staff who will need access to CFTC-controlled information systems, or will need access to CFTC premises and will be unescorted while on CFTC's premises.</p>
<p>B. Contractor staff who are expected to be employed on this contract for six months or less and who will require access to CFTC-controlled information systems and/or unescorted access to CFTC facilities shall be subject to a Special Agreement Check (hereinafter referred to as a "SAC" or "Check"). To initiate this Check, the Contractor shall ensure that such staff complete an OFI Form 86C (Special Agreement Check), an Authorization for Release of Information, and a release authorizing CFTC to obtain a credit report. This Check must be favorably adjudicated for the staff to obtain employment in this capacity.</p>
<p>C. Contractor staff who are expected to be employed on this contract for greater than six months and who will require access to CFTC-controlled information systems and/or unescorted access to CFTC facilities will be required, at a minimum, to undergo a SAC and a National Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI). The SAC must be favorably adjudicated for the staff to obtain employment in this capacity. The NACI must be favorably adjudicated post-employment for the staff to continue employment in this capacity. Depending upon the duties assigned, CFTC may require a higher level investigation, such as a Minimum Background Investigation (MBI), a Limited Background Investigation (LBI), a Background Investigation (BI), or a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI). (NACI and higher level investigations are hereinafter referred to as "Investigations.") Any higher level Investigations must be favorably adjudicated for the staff to continue employment in this capacity.</p>
<p>D. The Check and Investigations cited in paragraphs B and C above will not be required if: (1) Contractor staff possess a valid current Federal identity credential that is verified by the individual's former department or agency to the satisfaction of the CFTC; and (2) the individual has undergone the required Check and/or Investigations at another agency and has been favorably adjudicated. If the completed NACI occurred 15 or more years ago, the CFTC has the discretion to determine whether a new Investigation is needed and whether a higher level investigation is warranted. The Contractor shall comply with this determination and shall ensure that contractor staff complete and submit the necessary documents within the time frame established by the CFTC or risk its staff being rendered ineligible to perform under the contract with the CFTC.</p>
<p>E.1. In the event Contractor staff referred to in paragraph D above meet the requirements of that paragraph, Contractor shall provide to the COR the candidates' name, social security number, date of birth, and city and state of birth for verification purposes.<br /><br />E.2. If Contractor staff do not have current clearances or a favorably-adjudicated Check and Investigation prior to working at CFTC or gaining access to federally-controlled information systems, Contractor shall ensure that the required background investigation forms, as defined by a CFTC Personnel Security Representative, are submitted to the CFTC Personnel Security Representative as follows. Forms required under paragraph B above shall be submitted to the CFTC Personnel Security Representative not later than five days after the effective date of this contract. Forms required under paragraph C and D above shall be submitted not later than five days after they are identified by CFTC.</p>
<p>F. Contractor staff described in paragraph B above who remain on site at CFTC for greater than six months shall be subject to the requirements of paragraph C above.</p>
<p>G. All investigation forms are available on the Internet at http://www.opm.gov/Forms/html/sf.asp or from the CFTC Personnel Security Representative at the following address:</p>
<p>CFTC Personnel Security Representative<br />Office of Management Operations, Room 4025<br />Commodity Futures Trading Commission<br />1155 21st Street, N.W.<br />Washington, D.C. 20581</p>
<p>H. Completed investigation forms shall be submitted to the CFTC Personnel Security Representative at the address cited above. The Personnel Security Representative will arrange for fingerprinting of candidates and submit completed applications and fingerprints to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for investigation.</p>
<p>I. For Contractor staff as described in paragraph C above, the SAC will serve as a pre-screening measure and will meet interim clearance needs. The subject Contractor staff may be allowed to commence work with a favorable finding on the SAC. Continuation of work for CFTC depends upon favorable adjudication by the CFTC Personnel Security Director of the NACI. If required by the contractor staff's work, the agency may require an investigation higher than a NACI after the contractor staff is on board. Any subsequent Investigation must be favorably adjudicated by the CFTC Personnel Security Director in order for the contractor staff to continue to work at CFTC.</p>
<p>J. The Contractor shall ensure that its staff maintains valid clearances as necessary while performing work for CFTC under this contract. However, should clearances from another agency expire during the period of performance under the contract, the Contractor shall immediately notify the COR. The Personnel Security Representative will determine if the Contractor needs to renew its staff's clearance. If so, CFTC may initiate the necessary Checks and Investigations.</p>
<p>K. In addition to the security requirements cited above, prior to fingerprinting and upon commencement of work at the Commission, all staff described in paragraphs B and C above must show the Personal Security Representative two forms of original identification. One such identification must be a valid state or federal government issued picture identification; the second must be from the list of acceptable documentation contained in Form I-9 (Revision 05/31/05). Identification verification is required before CFTC will issue a personal identification verification card to the Contractor staff.</p>
<p>11. GOVERNMENT RIGHTS IN DATA<br />The Government shall have unrestricted rights in all documentation and other data developed by the Contractor under this contract, as described in FAR Clause 52.227-14, Rights in Data-General (December 2007), which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p><br />12. USE OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY<br />Government property [see FAR 45.101(a)] shall be used only for performing work under this contract, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall be responsible and accountable for all Government property provided under the contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be liable for shortages, loss, damages, or destruction of Government property in its possession or control. The Contractor shall investigate and report to the Contracting Officer or the COR all cases of loss, damage, or destruction of Government property in its possession or control as soon as the facts become known or when requested by the Contracting Officer or the COR.</p>
<p>For work required to be performed at CFTC's facility, CFTC will furnish appropriate workspace, including general furnishings, telephone, and personal computer. <br /><br />13. LIABILITY<br />This clause addresses liability arising beyond that which is specific to Government property. Liability for shortages, loss, damages or destruction of Government property is addressed in the "Use of Government Property" clause of this contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for all liabilities which result from willful misconduct, gross negligence, or lack of good faith on the part of any of its officers and employees. Such liability is not restricted by any dollar limitations.<br /><br />14. KEY CONTROL, ID BADGES AND ACCESS CARD<br />(a) The Government will provide the necessary building passes, access cards, and keys (as appropriate) to contractor employees. These passes, cards, and keys shall be returned within one (1) day to the COR upon an employee's termination of employment with the Contractor and/or reassignment. Also, all passes, cards, and keys shall be returned to the COR at the conclusion of the performance period of each task order.</p>
<p>(b) All Contractor personnel working on CFTC premises shall adhere to all security and identification badge requirements. Identification badges shall be visible at all times. Exceptions apply when doing so would present a physical hazard, such as while working near or with certain equipment or machinery.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall establish and implement methods of ensuring that all keys, badges, and access cards issued to the Contractor's employees by the Government are not lost or misplaced, and are not used by unauthorized persons. No passes, cards or keys issued to the Contractor by the Government shall be duplicated.</p>
<p>(d) The contractor shall immediately report the occurrence of a lost key, badge, or access card to the COR. If the COR cannot be immediately reached, the contractor shall immediately report the loss to the CFTC Chief of Security. The Contractor may be required to replace lost keys, or reimburse the Government for replacement of locks and/or keys. In the event a master key is lost or duplicated, the Government will replace all locks and keys for that system. Any costs related to replacing the locks and keys, due to a master key being lost or duplicated, shall be borne solely by the Contractor.</p>
<p>15. COMPUTER SECURITY<br />The Contractor shall obtain, read, understand, and comply with the policy and procedures of the Commission's computer security program and limited personal use policy prior to being granted access to the internal network. Access to CFTC computer systems is requested and granted only on an as-needed basis to perform official CFTC business. Computer systems and hardware may not be modified by the Contractor without express written consent from the COR. The downloading of computer games and/or their operation is prohibited.</p>
<p>16. PERFORMANCE BASED SERVICE CONTRACTING<br />Performance based service contracting (PBSC) emphasizes that all aspects of an acquisition be structured around the purpose of the work to be performed as opposed to the manner in which the work is to be performed or broad, imprecise statements of work which preclude an objective assessment of contractor performance. It is designed to ensure that contractors are given freedom to determine how to meet the Government's performance objectives. Incentives are used to motivate the Contractor to consistently achieve appropriate performance quality levels. CFTC has developed the performance metrics specified in Attachment A to the RFP, which will be used to evaluate and incentivize the Contractor's performance.</p>

<DESC>USAID's Regional Development Mission Asia (RDMA) serves as a major regional center providing a full range of program, technical, and support services to South and East Asia and the South Pacific. The RDMA manages regional programs throughout Asia as well as substantial bilateral programs in countries without bilateral USAID missions, including Burma, China, Laos, Malaysia, Papa New Guinea, and Thailand.
<p>The RDMA's Regional Environment Office (REO) administers environmental programs across Asia that focus on transnational problems that cannot be solved solely at the country level; strengthen regional institutions and networks; engage Asian countries to participate in regional dialogue and partnerships; and advance high-priority US Government initiatives at the regional level. Climate change is one of the century's greatest challenges, and low emissions climate&#8208;resilient development has become a top priority for US Government development assistance and diplomacy.</p>
<p>As a key member of the REO team, the Senior Regional Climate Change Advisor is responsible for supporting and coordinating the implementation of the Enhancing Capacity for Low Emission Development Strategies (EC-LEDS) initiative in Asia, with a view to promote an integrated and cohesive response among the various U.S. Government agencies that are providing their technical expertise. In carrying out duties in all these areas, the Advisor will be expected to initiate and maintain productive working relations at the executive level, including with U.S. ambassadors and Deputy Chiefs of Mission, national government counterparts up to the vice minister level, and executive managers of international organizations and NGO partners.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), US Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112 , Washington, D. C. 20593 -7112. Telephone (202) 372 3695.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>
<p>Closing date/time for submission of quotations is 09 MAR 2012 at 1100 AM Pacific Time. Ensure that in addition to prices, quotes include applicable representations and certifications and all other information required by above incorporated clauses.

<p><strong>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME</strong>: Air Force Research Laboratory<br />Munitions Directorate <br />101 W. Eglin Blvd <br />Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810</p>
<p><strong>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TITLE</strong>: Armament Technology</p>
<p><strong>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE</strong>: Amendment #2 to BAA-RWK-10-0001, dated 28 April 2011</p>
<p><strong>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER:</strong> BAA-RWK-10-0001</p>
<p><strong>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) NUMBER(S):</strong> 12.800 Air Force Defense Research Sciences Program</p>
<p><strong>WHITE PAPER DUE DATE AND TIME:</strong> This BAA will remain open through 30 April 2012, or until amended or superseded. It may be reissued and/or amended periodically, as needed. White papers may be submitted at any time during the open period to afrl.rwk.baaworkflow@eglin.af.mil.</p>
<p><strong>I. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>This is a Broad Agency Announcement of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW) under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraph 6.102(d)(2), which provides for competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.</p>
<p>For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs. It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs. A program should be designed to demonstrate well-defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not be a paper study that inherently requires a substantial testing effort. Any significant testing is unlikely; however, there is a possibility of experimental testing to support battle lab experiments proposed under this BAA. Occasionally, AFRL/RW will have more specific research interests or topics that warrant specific attention. Under those circumstances, a specific BAA will be issued describing the requirement in greater detail, defining funding availability, elaborating on white paper or proposal submission due date and format, and possibly providing more specific evaluation criteria. Programs to support Team Eglin Technology Demonstration Programs may also be considered under this BAA.</p>
<p>AFRL/RW contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in armament technology. This BAA is intended to cover, in general nature, all research areas of interest to this Directorate. Offerors contemplating submission of a proposal to AFRL/RW should carefully examine this BAA, and are also strongly encouraged to contact the appropriate AFRL/RW technical Point of Contact (POC) identified in this publication to ascertain the extent of interest AFRL/RW may have in a specific research project.</p>
<p>AFRL/RW is the primary Air Force organization concerned with conventional munitions technology development. AFRL/RW plans and executes research, development, and test of conventional munitions, and supports conventional munitions Wings/Groups or Weapons Program Offices. There are four divisions within the Munitions Directorate that conduct research and development (R&amp;D). They are the Demonstration Division, the Advanced Guidance Division, the Strategic Planning and Assessment Division, and the Ordnance Division.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DEMONSTRATION DIVISION (RWA)<br /></span></strong>The Demonstration Division (RWA) directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development in weapon/missile airframes, and submunition design and dispensing. RWA also integrates optimal subsystems, performs tests, and conducts flight demonstrations. RWA consists of the Systems of Systems Branch (RWAS), and the Flight Vehicles Integration Branch (RWAV).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ADVANCED GUIDANCE DIVISION (RWG)<br /></span></strong>The Advanced Guidance Division (RWG) conducts research and directs exploratory and advanced development in guidance and control technology to support development of autonomous, precision-guided munitions. The relevant technologies are in two general areas: seekers and conventional guidance and control. The seeker technologies include electro-optical, infrared, millimeter-wave, and radio frequency seekers for air-to-air and air-to-surface conventional weapons, exointerceptors, and submunition guidance. This includes signal/image processing algorithms and processors. Conventional guidance and control includes inertial sensors, global positioning system (GPS) receivers, antijam GPS technologies, and relevant information processing including guidance laws, state vector estimators, and autopilots. RWG performs digital modeling and simulation, synthetic scene generation, laboratory, field, and captive flight tests of seeker concepts and conventional guidance and control concepts. RWG also operates and maintains a hardware-in-the-loop closed loop guidance evaluation facility with synthetic scene generation and digital modeling and simulation capability, a radio-frequency measurement laboratory, a laser radar facility, an advanced navigation laboratory, and an electro-optics laboratory. RWG consists of the Integration Guidance Simulation Branch (RWGG), Integration Sensing &amp; Processing Sciences Branch (RWGI), Weapons Dynamics &amp; Controls Branch (RWGN), and the Weapons Seeker Sciences Branch (RWGS.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ORDNANCE DIVISION (RWM)<br /></span></strong>The Ordnance Division (RWM) directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development research of fuzes, damage mechanisms, and energetic materials for air launched munitions for use with a full array of launch platforms including fighter, bomber, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aircraft. RWM consists of the Energetic Materials Branch (RWME), Fuzes Branch (RWMF), Damage Mechanisms Branch (RWMW), and Ordnance Integration Branch (RWMI). RWME operates the High Explosives R&amp;D (HERD) facility which is responsible for the development of energetic materials from concept formulation through pilot plant production for transition into existing or future inventory weapon systems. RWMF is responsible for the research and development of technologies to enable precision burst point control initiation of current and future weapon systems. Examples of precision burst point control include post-impact hard target intelligent fuzing and high-closing rate air-to-air and air-to-ground target imaging and aim point selection. RWMW interests range from fundamental understanding of detonation wave implications for damage mechanism formation (i.e., explosively formed penetrators, stretch long rod penetrators, directed fragments) to shaped charge liner materials processing in the Focused Energy Warheads arena that is striving to reduce warhead size and increase lethality and adaptability for application to surface mobile targets and fixed targets. These interests range from fundamental understanding of material behavior in high rate, high-pressure processes (i.e., strain, erosion, toughness), to enhancement of existing blast/fragment warheads, to R&amp;D of novel kill mechanisms for fixed surface targets, both soft and hardened, in the Unitary Warheads arena. RWMI is responsible for conducting the ordnance level studies to establish the development trade space for the fuze, energetic materials and damage mechanism technologies. RWMI is also responsible for defining the interfaces between these technologies, and integrating and demonstrating various levels of ordnance packages prior to higher level weapon system integration and/or transition.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STRATEGIC PLANNING AND ASSESSMENT DIVISION (RWP)<br /></span></strong>The Strategic Planning and Assessment Division (RWP) is responsible for strategic planning and assessment of lethality, effectiveness, utility of weapon technologies, and evaluation of expected weapon performance by simulation. Strategic planning consists of overall RW investment planning; determining warfighter issues and requirements related to munitions and the transition opportunities for science and technology, and managing the cooperative research, technology transfer, and SBIR programs. RWP directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development in weapon/missile modeling and simulation, basic physics and computational modeling. RWP consists of the Capability Planning Branch (RWPB), the Computational Mechanics Branch (RWPC), and the Lethality and Vulnerability Branch (RWPL).</p>
<p>The descriptions of the technical areas are organized by scientific discipline, and the reader may note some overlap between sections. The following narratives are intended to provide an abbreviated description of the sixteen prospective research areas. These descriptions are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to challenge the reader to create and submit truly creative proposals that have the potential to dramatically shift existing air delivered munitions paradigms. These descriptions furnish specific examples of areas of interest and Directorate focal points associated with these technology areas. However, any submitted white paper or proposal must be grounded in achievable technology goals.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 1 - WEAPON AERIAL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH (RWAV)</strong></p>
<p>Advances in weapon aerial systems technologies are required to take advantage of emerging developments in weapon guidance systems, networked information systems, and precision effect ordnance systems. The goal of this work is to perform weapon aerial systems technology research for development of agile weapon airframes capable of delivering precision controlled effects against fixed and mobile ground targets and air targets. Research areas of interest include: agile weapon airframe design for all flight regimes; precision weapon subsystems integration; miniature weapon design, carriage, and dispensing technology; weapon control and actuation system technology; compact power and actuation for miniature weapons; unmanned combat air vehicle weapon integration/dispensing; and compressed carriage munitions design. Airframe technology research approaches should build upon advances in dynamic systems, aerodynamics, structural dynamics, materials, propulsion, and flight dynamics theories and methodologies; should exploit advances in other weapon technologies (e.g., advanced sensors and seekers, guidance and control algorithms, network information architectures, controlled effect ordnance, etc.); should be amenable to further development through sound principles of systems engineering; and should offer the potential for significantly improving affordable weapon aerial systems capabilities and reliabilities.</p>

<p>Both biological systems and smart munitions are required to collect space, time, and color information from the environment, process it, and make some decision. The decision may be that of detecting, recognizing, tracking, or intercepting an object. The decision may also be that of changing position or direction of motion for vehicle navigation or for better viewing of a target. A clear understanding of how the natural systems collect and process information to make these kinds of decisions may lead to revolutionary seeker concepts for autonomous weapons, as well as other machine vision applications. Thus, RWGI is interested in signal processing and control methods that use natural concepts found in biological systems. Our focus in biomimetics (the science of mimicking biological systems) is on leveraging efforts previously aimed at understanding how life forms collect and process environmental information. We want to use what is understood about the natural seekers to build small and affordable autonomous munitions seekers. As biologically inspired seeker system concepts mature and exploit commercially available technology, the resemblance to the original biological system may diminish or even disappear. This consequence reflects our focus on building affordable, capable seekers for smart munitions. Proposed concepts should support the mission of the Munitions Directorate and Advanced Guidance Division.</p>

<p>RWGI is interested in investigating all aspects of Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) technology as it applies to seekers for conventional guided weapons. Interests range from basic signal/image processing foundations through tower and flight test of advanced real time ATR/host signal processor implementations. ATR systems (and related technologies) designed for use with all relevant weapon system sensors (MMW Radar, SAR, IIR, LADAR, Dual Mode combinations, etc.) are of interest.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 4 - HARDWARE-IN-THE-LOOP SIMULATION TECHNOLOGIES (RWGG)</strong></p>
<p>RWGG is interested in developing advanced capabilities related to hardware-in-the-loop and digital simulation of guided weapon designs. RWGG exercises simulations to verify weapon performance, with particular emphasis on target acquisition, tracking, and guidance performance during terminal homing. Sensors and algorithms for Strategic and Theater Missile Defense concepts developed under the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and Tactical Munitions subsystems developed within AFRL/RW are evaluated. Weapons tested typically include visible, imaging infrared, millimeter-wave, and/or LADAR seeker subsystems. Emphasis for simulation technology research is placed on advancement and improvements to scene projection/projector technologies, real-time target scene generation techniques, target phenomenology methods, simulation architectures, millimeter-wave simulators, cryogenic chamber simulator, wide field-of-view flight motion simulators, and high bandwidth motion simulators.</p>

<p>Integral to the development of advanced munitions programs is the capability at AFRL/RW to perform high fidelity simulation-based testing of munitions, components and systems. The current capability to generate synthetic imagery for high fidelity hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) and Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) algorithm testing is based on a toolbox of independent Government and industry tools for predicting threat characteristics, environmental effects, and munitions hardware and software performance. The evolution in complexity and capability of modern weapons systems, however, is leading to demands for higher fidelity and performance from test simulations. In addition, the integrated nature of the modern battlefield requires test simulations to encompass not only the weapon itself, but also a variety of other systems. New scene generation (SG) techniques are needed in the areas of characterization of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and Air Force threats, urban environments, chemical/biological effects, coupling and integration of scene generation software, multiple sensor views, and advanced computing techniques. These SG improvements must be designed to streamline the process for evaluating guided munitions concepts from initial design to final implementation, lowering development costs and shortening time from drawing board to battlefield. The improved testing realism will provide confidence that the munitions will perform as expected under a much wider variety of combat conditions than previously possible.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 6 - LASER RADAR COMPONENT RESEARCH (RWGS)</strong></p>
<p>RWG has an interest in developing the components and systems necessary for imaging and non-imaging laser radar systems. These include, but are not limited to, optical sources, detector systems, beam pointing and beam scanning systems, detection schemes, and discrimination, ranging, and acquisition systems. Interests range from complete systems and devices to basic materials and components. These include the following: Optical Sources: Optical sources of various wavelengths from the visible to the mid-infrared (&lt; 5 microns) are desired. These devices may be diodes, diode or flashlamp-pumped solid-state lasers, or optical parametric oscillators (OPOs). The systems can operate at moderate output powers at pulse repetition rates ranging from a few Hz to greater than 1 MHz. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, novel laser and OPO operating schemes, laser and OPO systems and designs, optical coatings, laser materials, and non-linear materials. Associated technologies, such as diode drive electronics, output power control and stabilization, wavelength tuning and stabilization techniques, rapid pulse generation, optical shutters and Q switches, polarization and phase controllers, and optical coupling techniques are also of interest. Detector systems: Single element and array detectors sensitive in the visible to mid-infrared wavelength range are desired. Rapid rise times (approaching a nanosecond) are desired, as is operability without cryogenic cooling. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, detector systems, detector materials, amplification and biasing electronics, temperature control systems, wavelength selection (filters, gratings, etc.), and readout technologies (for array detectors). Beam pointing and beam scanning systems: Systems that can rapidly steer a laser beam as well as the field of view of the detector are desired. Systems capable of search/track modes and variable fields of view are also desired. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, controlled mirror sets, microlens assemblies, gratings, acousto-optical devices, and liquid crystal devices. Associated technologies such as scanning drives and controllers, beam direction monitoring techniques, and pointing stabilization techniques are also of interest. Detection schemes: Various incoherent and coherent detection schemes are of interest. Such schemes include, but are not limited to, direct detection of reflected radiation, return detection of a modulated signal, detection of laser-induced fluorescence, and detection of raman scattered radiation. Possible methods for coherent detection include amplitude, frequency, phase, or polarization modulation. Discrimination, ranging, and acquisition systems: Systems that can discriminate the signal from the background environment, condition the signal, and store the data are required. These systems should be able to resolve time differences as small as or smaller than a nanosecond, dynamically adjust the gain of any amplification stages, allow variable timing/ranging techniques, and/or minimize range uncertainty. A variety of discrimination techniques are of interest, including nth pulse detection, constant fraction threshold detection, variable threshold detection, and others.</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 7 - NAVIGATION AND CONTROL TECHNOLOGY (RWGN)</strong></p>
<p>RWGN is developing global positioning system (GPS) anti-jam technology, geo-referenced alternative to GPS navigation, control algorithms for agile autonomous micro air vehicles and micro munitions, vision-based guidance methodologies, control algorithms for path planning and task assignment of cooperative systems of munitions and air vehicles, track fusion and on-line state estimation methods for fusing target tracks between weapon platforms, methodologies for operators to supervise the time critical control of collections of cooperating air vehicles, small and low cost components for secure low probability of intercept data links on micro weapons, and network topologies and routing algorithms for small to large networks of munitions with line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight links. GPS technologies of interest are anti-jam techniques including spatial (beam forming and/or null steering) and temporal anti-jam technologies, and miniature GPS antenna technologies. Biologically inspired but mathematically rigorous techniques are being pursued for agile and vision-based guidance and control. Cooperative control methodologies currently emphasize integrated path planning and task assignment, hedging for un-modeled (adversarial induced) uncertainty, and information theoretic bounds on performance of cooperative networks. Data link technologies are needed that will yield extreme miniaturization while being compatible with current and future military tactical networks.</p>

<p><br /><strong>RESEARCH AREA 8 - MODELING, SIMULATION, &amp; ANALYSIS (MS&amp;A) OF ADVANCED WEAPON CONCEPTS (RWPL)</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to develop/modify and employ models used to analyze advanced weapon concepts and their related concepts of employment to highlight technologies worthy of consideration for investment. The objective is to apply, modify and/or combine engineering, engagement (one-on-one), mission (few-on-few), systems-of-systems, campaign (many-on-many, military worth), level modeling techniques, tools, and analysis methods as well as virtual and constructive digital simulation which lend themselves to the quick and effective evaluation of advanced weapon concepts. Concepts include, but are not limited to, intercommunicative weapons, novel damage mechanisms, lethal and non-lethal destruct mechanisms, multiple targeting, and time critical delivery. Detailed modeling includes, but is not limited to, sensors, aerodynamics, autopilots, navigation and guidance schemes, propulsion, warheads, fuzes, datalinks, error filters, environment (wind, fog, dust), lethality, vulnerability, and threats. Scenario development and visualization at each level of MS&amp;A is also sought. Research into new simulation toolsets and architectures designed for this purpose will also be considered. Additionally, environmental factors that influence a weapons performance can be considered. This can include but not be limited to urban environments, collaborative simulation environments, scenario generation and infrastructure simulation common to environments that weapons may operate in. Existing tools of interest include, but are not limited to, ESAMS, RADGUNS, MATLAB/Simulink, FLAMES, EADSIM, CFAM, and STORM. White papers and proposals should be designed to demonstrate substantive knowledge in any or all of the specific areas of MS&amp;A. Some or all of the work performed under this BAA Research Area will be performed on-site (e.g. at the Government facility) and security clearances at the SECRET level will be required.</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 9 - TARGET VULNERABILITY AND WEAPON EFFECTIVENESS (RWPL)</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to collect data, conduct research, develop/modify and employ responsive modeling tools, target models, and processes as part of AFRL's R&amp;D efforts. These efforts will identify potential vulnerabilities in targets and their subcomponents for conventional or concept weapons to exploit. They will also enable understanding and predictive capability for the effectiveness of inventory, developmental, and conceptual munitions when deployed against targets and critical components. Targets of interest can include but are not limited to mobile, fixed (above and below ground), hard and deeply buried, chem-bio and air-to-air. This research will allow development of new techniques or enhancement of existing techniques to measure and compare weapon effectiveness, collateral damage, and potential collateral hazards. Research will include improvements in our ability to predict and measure component vulnerability and functional defeat allowing assessment of weapon effects that degrade a target's ability to perform its intended functions without necessarily destroying it. It could also include research and modeling of new or conceptual damage mechanisms. Development of new target and associated functional models would improve our abilities to exploit high interest targets or newly discovered vulnerabilities. Research to enhance or develop methodology to account for the target critical equipment/components, and their interconnections, and associated failure logic and failure modes could be required. Tools of interest include, but are not limited to AJEM, ARM, BLASTX, BRL-CAD, Endgame Framework, FastCD, FASTGEN, FATEPEN, IMEA, JWS, MEVA, ORCA, PENCURV, PDAM, STEP, STMG, VALUE, WEAPS, and WinBLAST. White papers and proposals should be designed to demonstrate substantive knowledge in any or all of the specific areas of weapon testing, experimentation and weapon effectiveness and target vulnerability MS&amp;A. Some or all of the work performed under this BAA Research Area will be classified. Approved classified processing capabilities and security clearances at the SECRET level as a minimum will be required.</p>

<p><br /><strong>RESEARCH AREA 10 - WEAPON/TARGET MECHANICS (RWPC)</strong></p>
<p>The performance assessment and development of advanced conventional weapon systems requires the capabilities to model complex weapon/target interaction phenomena and to predict environments produced by impacting, penetrating, and detonating warheads. Modeling may be achieved with simplified engineering models or system/subsystem analysis codes, but the emphasis of this effort is the development and validation of continuum mechanics codes yielding high fidelity weapon and target models. Areas of particular interest include penetration mechanics, high strain rate fracture dynamics and constitutive modeling, modeling the shock survivability of fuze<br />electronic components, predictive models for the change in material properties due to thermal cycling (energetics and electronics), fragmentation, mesoscale modeling (metals and energetics), localized shear band formation, high pressure/high strain rate modeling of geologic and geologically derived materials, modeling of reacting droplet and particulate flows, equation of state and constitutive models for chemical and biological agents, numerical modeling of neutralization mechanisms for biological and<br />chemical agents, hydrodynamic ram, atomization and aerosolization of chemical and biological agents, direct numerical simulation of detonations, coupled detonation physics and multi-phase flow, accurate and efficient boundary interface treatments, the ability to span several orders of magnitude in spatial and temporal length scales, and advanced numerical methods. Innovative theoretical, computational and experimental projects that specifically address the problems of interest and result in an improved predictive capability are the goal.</p>

<p>RWMW is interested in all aspects conventional munitions warhead technology as it relates to the destruction, damage, defeat, or denial of function. Technologies and concepts are sought for a robust and affordable capability of air-launched munitions in the areas of: hard and deeply buried targets, fixed ground targets, mobile ground vehicles, air dominance, chemical/biological/radiological/nuclear/explosive (CBRNE) neutralization or access denial, and cybernet neutralization. Additionally, there is interest in specialized diagnostics, techniques, and experimental methods for the development and validation of these capabilities. Technical interests within the Hard Target Effects technical competency are in penetration mechanics, materials for surviving high speed penetration of geologic and cementitious materials, abrasion resistance, terradynamic stability, innovative case structures and composites, and production methods. Fundamental science studies in high rate particulate flow and meso-scale modeling is an area of emphasis. The Damage Mechanisms Science technical competency has interests in miniature and micro warheads, multifunctional energetic materials and damage mechanisms, directional control and focused effects, selectable effects, and collateral damage control. Approaches in all of these areas are not to be limited to traditional nor classical blast-fragmentation effects. Novel concepts of target defeat are encouraged to augment or replace the more traditional kinetic energy methods.</p>

<p><br /><strong>RESEARCH AREA 12 - FUZE RESEARCH (RWMF)<br /></strong>RWMF develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies that have application to fuzes for air-delivered weapons, including, but not limited to, guided and unguided bombs, missiles, and submunitions. Fuzes must reliably remain in a safe mode until the appropriate post-deployment environments (such as freefall) are sensed; the fuze must then arm the weapon and, upon receiving a signal from a target detection device (TDD), initiate the explosive fill (or other damage mechanism). RWMF thus seeks proposals for innovative technologies that can be integrated into the design or testing of air-delivered weapon fuzes.<br />RWMF is particularly interested in fuzes (including submunition fuzes) and related technologies that are capable of surviving the repetitive, multi-axis shock environment experienced by a fuze during penetration of a hardened target and functioning the warhead through cockpit-selectable time delay functions and advanced post-impact environmental sensing. However, current test technologies do not fully duplicate the multi-axial fuze environment in terms of duration, repetitive high-acceleration loading, and other aspects of the mechanical loading profile. This necessitates extremely expensive sled tests for fuze research, testing, qualification, and performance evaluation. Therefore, a need exists for laboratory and field test techniques and equipment to duplicate these repetitive, multi-axial shocks.<br />Some additional penetration fuzing-specific research tasks of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:<br />- Develop a jam-resistant, greater than 250 kilobits/second shock-hardened wireless Data Link for two-way communication with a fuze during a weapon's deep underground penetration event;<br />- Investigate methods/techniques for improving the shock survivability of inventory hardened fuzes (FMU-143, FMU-152) used in penetrating weapons; e.g., techniques for eliminating gaps/air voids between the fuze and fuzewell;<br />- Develop a hardened, passive, unpowered, tri-axial device that irreversibly and measurably changes some physical configuration or property without relaxation/hysteresis to record the peak acceleration as a back-up data point for tests when a hardened fuze data recorder fails;<br />- Develop a low-cost (&lt;$100), shock-hardened accelerometer;<br />- Develop non-inertial techniques and appropriate devices for detecting voids and layers during hard target penetration; and<br />- Develop a miniature passive or active sensor capable of identifying case breakup and/or severe trajectory instability during a hardened penetration event for the purpose of salvaging the fuze function and high explosive detonation-this technology must operate inside an existing fuze well as an add-on to existing fuze components and have low false alarm rate.</p>
<p>RWMF is also interested in improved sensors, techniques, and/or systems for second safety environment sensing for gravity released general-purpose bombs. For example, an improvement or replacement for the FZU-32, -48, etc., would be of significant interest. <br />In the area of miniature and micro-munition fuzing, research tasks of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:<br />- Reliable miniature three port air valve that has a wide temperature operating range (-55 to +75 degree C) <br />- Ground profiling fuze sensor technology<br />- Active imaging aimpoint selecting fuze sensor technology<br />The final area of focused interest is in the area of in-line and out-of-line initiation systems. RWMF Initiation Science and Technology group is interested in novel ignition devices or ignition circuitry that can enhance reliability while reducing energy budgets for initiation systems. Additionally, concepts that would enable novel warhead designs are of interest. We are also interested in novel or more inherently robust manufacturing processes that can be applied to components within initiation systems. Finally, there is interest in methods or techniques for characterizing performance of those systems.</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 14 - FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT ENABLING MICRO MUNITIONS AND ADVANCED ENERGETICS (RWME)</strong></p>
<p>AFRL/RW anticipates a need for new, improved, and often unique facilities and equipment to support expanding future in-house RDT&amp;E (research, development, test, and evaluation) work especially in the areas of micro munitions and advanced energetic. This work will require facilities with the capability to work with energetic nano materials that may also be classified as an explosive. These new RW facilities and equipment will enable world class research, development, integration, fabrication and testing of future prototype munitions system concepts demonstrating emerging micro munition and advanced energetics technologies. Developing concepts and preliminary designs for these new and unique facilities as well as for much of the new equipment to be used in these facilities will need to be approached as research and development projects, not as just design projects. New control/monitoring techniques and equipment will be required to simultaneously meet HVAC requirements for working with nano materials that are also an explosive especially in areas where a clean room environment is required. Of particular interest are proposals for preliminary feasibility studies; concept development, assessment, evaluation, preliminary design and associated cost estimates/presentation material for the new facilities and/or new research equipment that will be required to pursue this evolution of energetics from conventional explosives to reactive materials and nano energetics and munitions from the current conventional munitions to micro munitions. Also of interest are proposals for structural response calculations/modeling, design analysis, and design needed to support Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) submittals/presentations required for explosives siting approval of new facilities to be located at one of RW's remote explosives locations. This topic includes work to advance the understanding of nano energetic material effects on both the human body and the environment as well as work relating to the understanding, interpretation, and assessment of present and likely future applicable environmental, safety, and health requirements/regulations that would relate to nano energetics. A need is anticipated for developing new systems/components that will enable the new facilities and equipment to meet these emerging future requirements/regulations.</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 15 - Multi-function Multi-mode RADAR RESEARCH (RWGS)</strong></p>
<p>RWG has an interest in developing innovative multifunction radar systems that lend themselves to a variety of applications for both munitions and Combat UAV's. There is a need for generating multi mode seeker systems where RF is one of the modes that can provide the weather capability and be amalgamated innovatively with IR, EO or Ladar modes in order to provide improved ATR and aim point selection to the munitions seeker system. There is also the interest of creating small munitions seeker and sensor technologies that would provide low cost solutions for creating submunitions seekers. These seekers are to be integrated into a 20 pound munitions full-up-round, for creating smart guided submunitions that can be incorporated into a larger cluster munition for dispensing in a target rich environment. These submunitions require weather capability, and innovative miniature RF solutions are of great interest. There is also interest in developing a Noise/ LPI radar seeker that can provide the capability of not being detected. These seekers must provide the function of detecting, acquiring, tracking, and engaging targets with a very small probability of being detected. The interest also extends to hypersonic and high speed environments. The high speed environment provides interesting requirements that provide great opportunities for innovations in materials implementation, apertures, component technologies and processing. RWG is also interested in dome technology and dome materials for these high speed applications. Concepts and innovative ideas for solutions to these different seeker applications are also of interest. The various seeker applications listed above have many implications of RF components, aperture technology ( conformal, broadband, electronically steered, mechanically steered, concentric apertures), real time processing, miniaturization of subsystems, etc. Signal processing techniques for these various seeker technology described, and the ability to detect, track, and engage targets is of interest. The seeker systems listed above are also expected to provide good measurements for the purpose of guiding the munitions, or CUAC to the intended target. Along with this is the ability to provide measurements or information for the use of classifying the target once reacquired. Another interest is in the seeker system being able to provide fuzing information that would lend itself for an innovative approach for Guidance integrated Fuzing (GIF) applications.</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 16 - REVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH (RW)</strong></p>
<p>This research area is intended to cover, in general nature, all revolutionary research areas of interest to this Directorate. AFRL/RW is interested in revolutionary munitions-related research that has the potential to create new<br />airframe, ordnance, and guidance and control technology weapon paradigms. One of the goals of this program is to develop highly innovative solutions relating to munitions ordnance packages and airframe technology for the purpose of defeating a variety of targets including fixed and moving targets, hard and soft targets, and above ground and deeply buried targets. Ideas and concepts are sought that represent new approaches - lethal and non-lethal - to defeat these targets. With this type of revolutionary thinking, as opposed to evolutionary, order of magnitude increases in performance may be realized.</p>
<p>The military payoff would be in terms of significant munitions weight and size<br />reduction, reduced weapon cost, and improved effectiveness. Non-lethal<br />approaches also have the benefit of disabling enemy capabilities with reduced<br />loss of life.</p>
<p>Another goal of this research area is to develop highly innovative concepts and<br />approaches in guidance and control technologies for air-deliverable autonomous munitions. This program may develop advanced concepts in such areas as electro-optical, infrared, millimeter wave, and radio frequency seeker technology with the components and signal/image processing systems used in such seekers. Advanced concepts in the guidance, navigation and control (GN&amp;C) of munitions airframes will also be sought. The basic seeker&nbsp; technologies to be considered include: sensing materials, sensing elements for target characterization, autonomous target acquisition algorithms, signal and image processing algorithms, and multi-sensor data fusion algorithms. The basic GN&amp;C technologies include: miniature inertial measurement units (IMUs), Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, jam resistant GPS, and micro-electro-mechanical system based sensing and control cooperative attack algorithms. In addition to advancements in the basic technology, revolutionary<br />changes that shift current or create new guidance and control paradigms will be<br />developed.</p>

<p><strong>V. WHITE PAPER REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Criteria:</strong> The following four criteria and an assessment of risk will be used to determine whether full proposals will be invited based on the white paper submitted. The Government reserves the right to select all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds. These criteria and proposal risk for schedule discussed in paragraph 2 below will also be used to evaluate formal proposals, should they be requested.</p>
<p>The following factors are listed in descending order of importance. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. <br /><br /><strong>1. Evaluation Criteria:<br /><br /></strong>a. An integrated assessment of the proposed technical approach to include scientific and/or technical merits and the potential contributions of the effort to extending the scientific understanding associated with the technologies being pursued by the four AFRL/RW Divisions and described in the 16 research areas. <br />b. The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposed project objectives presented in the white paper/formal proposal. <br />c. The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposed project objectives presented in the white paper/formal proposal. <br />d. The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror if any, and the availability of funds (i.e., considering budgets and funding). Cost/Price is a substantial factor but is ranked as the fourth order of priority.</p>
<p><strong>2. Proposal Risk Assessment</strong>: Proposal risk for technical and cost will be assessed for white papers and formal proposals, should they be requested, as part of the evaluation of the above evaluation criteria. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential scientific benefit. Additionally for formal proposals, proposal risk for schedule will be evaluated. This relates to an assessment of the risks associated with the offeror's proposed number of hours, labor categories, materials, or other cost elements as it relates to meeting the proposed period of performance.</p>
<p>Individual white papers will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers submitted under this BAA. White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>It is the policy of AFRL/RW to treat all white papers as privileged information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. White papers will be subject to an evaluation by highly qualified Government scientists. The offeror must appropriately indicate any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the white paper (see also paragraph IV.B. above). Should white papers be selected and full proposals requested, the proposal is subject to incorporation into a resulting contract and is therefore releasable under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) unless specifically exempt or portions of the proposal are exempt under FOIA .</p>
<p><strong>B. Review and Selection Process</strong>: The evaluation described above will generally result in white papers being placed in one of the three categories below:</p>
<p><strong>1. Category I</strong>: Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the AFRL/RW technology research areas, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.<br /><br /><strong>2. Category II</strong>: Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.</p>
<p><strong>3. Category III:</strong> Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.</p>
<p><strong>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Award Notices (White Papers):</strong> Offerors of those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the Contracting Officer. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting offeror will be awarded a contract.

<p><strong>VIII. OTHER INFORMATION PERTINENT TO AWARD OF CONTRACTS AND/OR ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Support Contractors:</strong> Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The AFRL Munitions Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: <br />1. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files;<br />2. Accessing library files for use by Government personnel; and<br />3. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.<br />Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p><strong>B. Communication:</strong> Dialogue between prospective offerors and Government representatives is encouraged until submission of proposals. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p><strong>C. Debriefings:</strong> Contractors whose white papers or proposals are not selected for further consideration/award, may request a debriefing. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016).</p>
<p><strong>D. Wide Area Work Flow Notice:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. The clause cites three possible electronic formats through which to submit electronic payment requests. Effective 1 October 2006, the Department of Defense adopted Wide Area Work Flow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA), as the electronic format for submission of electronic payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system. Information regarding WAWF-RA, including the web-based training and registration, can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil/ . Note: WAWF-RA requirement does not apply to universities that are audited by an agency other than DCAA.</p>
<p><strong>E. Item Identification and Valuation:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Aug 2008) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the Government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items.

<p><strong>WHITE PAPER DUE DATE AND TIME:&nbsp; </strong>This BAA has been superseded by BAA-RWK-12-0001, located at https://www.fbo.gov/spg/USAF/AFMC/AFRLERS/BAA-RWK-12-0001/listing.html</p>
<p><strong>I. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>This is a Broad Agency Announcement of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW) under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraph 6.102(d)(2), which provides for competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.</p>
<p>For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs. It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs. A program should be designed to demonstrate well-defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not be a paper study that inherently requires a substantial testing effort. Any significant testing is unlikely; however, there is a possibility of experimental testing to support battle lab experiments proposed under this BAA. Occasionally, AFRL/RW will have more specific research interests or topics that warrant specific attention. Under those circumstances, a specific BAA will be issued describing the requirement in greater detail, defining funding availability, elaborating on white paper or proposal submission due date and format, and possibly providing more specific evaluation criteria. Programs to support Team Eglin Technology Demonstration Programs may also be considered under this BAA.</p>
<p>AFRL/RW contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in armament technology. This BAA is intended to cover, in general nature, all research areas of interest to this Directorate. Offerors contemplating submission of a proposal to AFRL/RW should carefully examine this BAA, and are also strongly encouraged to contact the appropriate AFRL/RW technical Point of Contact (POC) identified in this publication to ascertain the extent of interest AFRL/RW may have in a specific research project.</p>
<p>AFRL/RW is the primary Air Force organization concerned with conventional munitions technology development. AFRL/RW plans and executes research, development, and test of conventional munitions, and supports conventional munitions Wings/Groups or Weapons Program Offices. There are four divisions within the Munitions Directorate that conduct research and development (R&amp;D). They are the Demonstration Division, the Advanced Guidance Division, the Strategic Planning and Assessment Division, and the Ordnance Division.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DEMONSTRATION DIVISION (RWA)<br /></span></strong>The Demonstration Division (RWA) directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development in weapon/missile airframes, and submunition design and dispensing. RWA also integrates optimal subsystems, performs tests, and conducts flight demonstrations. RWA consists of the Systems of Systems Branch (RWAS), and the Flight Vehicles Integration Branch (RWAV).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ADVANCED GUIDANCE DIVISION (RWG)<br /></span></strong>The Advanced Guidance Division (RWG) conducts research and directs exploratory and advanced development in guidance and control technology to support development of autonomous, precision-guided munitions. The relevant technologies are in two general areas: seekers and conventional guidance and control. The seeker technologies include electro-optical, infrared, millimeter-wave, and radio frequency seekers for air-to-air and air-to-surface conventional weapons, exointerceptors, and submunition guidance. This includes signal/image processing algorithms and processors. Conventional guidance and control includes inertial sensors, global positioning system (GPS) receivers, antijam GPS technologies, and relevant information processing including guidance laws, state vector estimators, and autopilots. RWG performs digital modeling and simulation, synthetic scene generation, laboratory, field, and captive flight tests of seeker concepts and conventional guidance and control concepts. RWG also operates and maintains a hardware-in-the-loop closed loop guidance evaluation facility with synthetic scene generation and digital modeling and simulation capability, a radio-frequency measurement laboratory, a laser radar facility, an advanced navigation laboratory, and an electro-optics laboratory. RWG consists of the Integration Guidance Simulation Branch (RWGG), Integration Sensing &amp; Processing Sciences Branch (RWGI), Weapons Dynamics &amp; Controls Branch (RWGN), and the Weapons Seeker Sciences Branch (RWGS.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ORDNANCE DIVISION (RWM)<br /></span></strong>The Ordnance Division (RWM) directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development research of fuzes, damage mechanisms, and energetic materials for air launched munitions for use with a full array of launch platforms including fighter, bomber, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aircraft. RWM consists of the Energetic Materials Branch (RWME), Fuzes Branch (RWMF), Damage Mechanisms Branch (RWMW), and Ordnance Integration Branch (RWMI). RWME operates the High Explosives R&amp;D (HERD) facility which is responsible for the development of energetic materials from concept formulation through pilot plant production for transition into existing or future inventory weapon systems. RWMF is responsible for the research and development of technologies to enable precision burst point control initiation of current and future weapon systems. Examples of precision burst point control include post-impact hard target intelligent fuzing and high-closing rate air-to-air and air-to-ground target imaging and aim point selection. RWMW interests range from fundamental understanding of detonation wave implications for damage mechanism formation (i.e., explosively formed penetrators, stretch long rod penetrators, directed fragments) to shaped charge liner materials processing in the Focused Energy Warheads arena that is striving to reduce warhead size and increase lethality and adaptability for application to surface mobile targets and fixed targets. These interests range from fundamental understanding of material behavior in high rate, high-pressure processes (i.e., strain, erosion, toughness), to enhancement of existing blast/fragment warheads, to R&amp;D of novel kill mechanisms for fixed surface targets, both soft and hardened, in the Unitary Warheads arena. RWMI is responsible for conducting the ordnance level studies to establish the development trade space for the fuze, energetic materials and damage mechanism technologies. RWMI is also responsible for defining the interfaces between these technologies, and integrating and demonstrating various levels of ordnance packages prior to higher level weapon system integration and/or transition.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STRATEGIC PLANNING AND ASSESSMENT DIVISION (RWP)<br /></span></strong>The Strategic Planning and Assessment Division (RWP) is responsible for strategic planning and assessment of lethality, effectiveness, utility of weapon technologies, and evaluation of expected weapon performance by simulation. Strategic planning consists of overall RW investment planning; determining warfighter issues and requirements related to munitions and the transition opportunities for science and technology, and managing the cooperative research, technology transfer, and SBIR programs. RWP directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development in weapon/missile modeling and simulation, basic physics and computational modeling. RWP consists of the Capability Planning Branch (RWPB), the Computational Mechanics Branch (RWPC), and the Lethality and Vulnerability Branch (RWPL).</p>
<p>The descriptions of the technical areas are organized by scientific discipline, and the reader may note some overlap between sections. The following narratives are intended to provide an abbreviated description of the sixteen prospective research areas. These descriptions are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to challenge the reader to create and submit truly creative proposals that have the potential to dramatically shift existing air delivered munitions paradigms. These descriptions furnish specific examples of areas of interest and Directorate focal points associated with these technology areas. However, any submitted white paper or proposal must be grounded in achievable technology goals.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 1 - WEAPON AERIAL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH (RWAV)</strong></p>
<p>Advances in weapon aerial systems technologies are required to take advantage of emerging developments in weapon guidance systems, networked information systems, and precision effect ordnance systems. The goal of this work is to perform weapon aerial systems technology research for development of agile weapon airframes capable of delivering precision controlled effects against fixed and mobile ground targets and air targets. Research areas of interest include: agile weapon airframe design for all flight regimes; precision weapon subsystems integration; miniature weapon design, carriage, and dispensing technology; weapon control and actuation system technology; compact power and actuation for miniature weapons; unmanned combat air vehicle weapon integration/dispensing; and compressed carriage munitions design. Airframe technology research approaches should build upon advances in dynamic systems, aerodynamics, structural dynamics, materials, propulsion, and flight dynamics theories and methodologies; should exploit advances in other weapon technologies (e.g., advanced sensors and seekers, guidance and control algorithms, network information architectures, controlled effect ordnance, etc.); should be amenable to further development through sound principles of systems engineering; and should offer the potential for significantly improving affordable weapon aerial systems capabilities and reliabilities.</p>

<p>Both biological systems and smart munitions are required to collect space, time, and color information from the environment, process it, and make some decision. The decision may be that of detecting, recognizing, tracking, or intercepting an object. The decision may also be that of changing position or direction of motion for vehicle navigation or for better viewing of a target. A clear understanding of how the natural systems collect and process information to make these kinds of decisions may lead to revolutionary seeker concepts for autonomous weapons, as well as other machine vision applications. Thus, RWGI is interested in signal processing and control methods that use natural concepts found in biological systems. Our focus in biomimetics (the science of mimicking biological systems) is on leveraging efforts previously aimed at understanding how life forms collect and process environmental information. We want to use what is understood about the natural seekers to build small and affordable autonomous munitions seekers. As biologically inspired seeker system concepts mature and exploit commercially available technology, the resemblance to the original biological system may diminish or even disappear. This consequence reflects our focus on building affordable, capable seekers for smart munitions. Proposed concepts should support the mission of the Munitions Directorate and Advanced Guidance Division.</p>

<p>RWGI is interested in investigating all aspects of Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) technology as it applies to seekers for conventional guided weapons. Interests range from basic signal/image processing foundations through tower and flight test of advanced real time ATR/host signal processor implementations. ATR systems (and related technologies) designed for use with all relevant weapon system sensors (MMW Radar, SAR, IIR, LADAR, Dual Mode combinations, etc.) are of interest.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 4 - HARDWARE-IN-THE-LOOP SIMULATION TECHNOLOGIES (RWGG)</strong></p>
<p>RWGG is interested in developing advanced capabilities related to hardware-in-the-loop and digital simulation of guided weapon designs. RWGG exercises simulations to verify weapon performance, with particular emphasis on target acquisition, tracking, and guidance performance during terminal homing. Sensors and algorithms for Strategic and Theater Missile Defense concepts developed under the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and Tactical Munitions subsystems developed within AFRL/RW are evaluated. Weapons tested typically include visible, imaging infrared, millimeter-wave, and/or LADAR seeker subsystems. Emphasis for simulation technology research is placed on advancement and improvements to scene projection/projector technologies, real-time target scene generation techniques, target phenomenology methods, simulation architectures, millimeter-wave simulators, cryogenic chamber simulator, wide field-of-view flight motion simulators, and high bandwidth motion simulators.</p>

<p>Integral to the development of advanced munitions programs is the capability at AFRL/RW to perform high fidelity simulation-based testing of munitions, components and systems. The current capability to generate synthetic imagery for high fidelity hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) and Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) algorithm testing is based on a toolbox of independent Government and industry tools for predicting threat characteristics, environmental effects, and munitions hardware and software performance. The evolution in complexity and capability of modern weapons systems, however, is leading to demands for higher fidelity and performance from test simulations. In addition, the integrated nature of the modern battlefield requires test simulations to encompass not only the weapon itself, but also a variety of other systems. New scene generation (SG) techniques are needed in the areas of characterization of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and Air Force threats, urban environments, chemical/biological effects, coupling and integration of scene generation software, multiple sensor views, and advanced computing techniques. These SG improvements must be designed to streamline the process for evaluating guided munitions concepts from initial design to final implementation, lowering development costs and shortening time from drawing board to battlefield. The improved testing realism will provide confidence that the munitions will perform as expected under a much wider variety of combat conditions than previously possible.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 6 - LASER RADAR COMPONENT RESEARCH (RWGS)</strong></p>
<p>RWG has an interest in developing the components and systems necessary for imaging and non-imaging laser radar systems. These include, but are not limited to, optical sources, detector systems, beam pointing and beam scanning systems, detection schemes, and discrimination, ranging, and acquisition systems. Interests range from complete systems and devices to basic materials and components. These include the following: Optical Sources: Optical sources of various wavelengths from the visible to the mid-infrared (&lt; 5 microns) are desired. These devices may be diodes, diode or flashlamp-pumped solid-state lasers, or optical parametric oscillators (OPOs). The systems can operate at moderate output powers at pulse repetition rates ranging from a few Hz to greater than 1 MHz. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, novel laser and OPO operating schemes, laser and OPO systems and designs, optical coatings, laser materials, and non-linear materials. Associated technologies, such as diode drive electronics, output power control and stabilization, wavelength tuning and stabilization techniques, rapid pulse generation, optical shutters and Q switches, polarization and phase controllers, and optical coupling techniques are also of interest. Detector systems: Single element and array detectors sensitive in the visible to mid-infrared wavelength range are desired. Rapid rise times (approaching a nanosecond) are desired, as is operability without cryogenic cooling. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, detector systems, detector materials, amplification and biasing electronics, temperature control systems, wavelength selection (filters, gratings, etc.), and readout technologies (for array detectors). Beam pointing and beam scanning systems: Systems that can rapidly steer a laser beam as well as the field of view of the detector are desired. Systems capable of search/track modes and variable fields of view are also desired. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, controlled mirror sets, microlens assemblies, gratings, acousto-optical devices, and liquid crystal devices. Associated technologies such as scanning drives and controllers, beam direction monitoring techniques, and pointing stabilization techniques are also of interest. Detection schemes: Various incoherent and coherent detection schemes are of interest. Such schemes include, but are not limited to, direct detection of reflected radiation, return detection of a modulated signal, detection of laser-induced fluorescence, and detection of raman scattered radiation. Possible methods for coherent detection include amplitude, frequency, phase, or polarization modulation. Discrimination, ranging, and acquisition systems: Systems that can discriminate the signal from the background environment, condition the signal, and store the data are required. These systems should be able to resolve time differences as small as or smaller than a nanosecond, dynamically adjust the gain of any amplification stages, allow variable timing/ranging techniques, and/or minimize range uncertainty. A variety of discrimination techniques are of interest, including nth pulse detection, constant fraction threshold detection, variable threshold detection, and others.</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 7 - NAVIGATION AND CONTROL TECHNOLOGY (RWGN)</strong></p>
<p>RWGN is developing global positioning system (GPS) anti-jam technology, geo-referenced alternative to GPS navigation, control algorithms for agile autonomous micro air vehicles and micro munitions, vision-based guidance methodologies, control algorithms for path planning and task assignment of cooperative systems of munitions and air vehicles, track fusion and on-line state estimation methods for fusing target tracks between weapon platforms, methodologies for operators to supervise the time critical control of collections of cooperating air vehicles, small and low cost components for secure low probability of intercept data links on micro weapons, and network topologies and routing algorithms for small to large networks of munitions with line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight links. GPS technologies of interest are anti-jam techniques including spatial (beam forming and/or null steering) and temporal anti-jam technologies, and miniature GPS antenna technologies. Biologically inspired but mathematically rigorous techniques are being pursued for agile and vision-based guidance and control. Cooperative control methodologies currently emphasize integrated path planning and task assignment, hedging for un-modeled (adversarial induced) uncertainty, and information theoretic bounds on performance of cooperative networks. Data link technologies are needed that will yield extreme miniaturization while being compatible with current and future military tactical networks.</p>

<p><br /><strong>RESEARCH AREA 8 - MODELING, SIMULATION, &amp; ANALYSIS (MS&amp;A) OF ADVANCED WEAPON CONCEPTS (RWPL)</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to develop/modify and employ models used to analyze advanced weapon concepts and their related concepts of employment to highlight technologies worthy of consideration for investment. The objective is to apply, modify and/or combine engineering, engagement (one-on-one), mission (few-on-few), systems-of-systems, campaign (many-on-many, military worth), level modeling techniques, tools, and analysis methods as well as virtual and constructive digital simulation which lend themselves to the quick and effective evaluation of advanced weapon concepts. Concepts include, but are not limited to, intercommunicative weapons, novel damage mechanisms, lethal and non-lethal destruct mechanisms, multiple targeting, and time critical delivery. Detailed modeling includes, but is not limited to, sensors, aerodynamics, autopilots, navigation and guidance schemes, propulsion, warheads, fuzes, datalinks, error filters, environment (wind, fog, dust), lethality, vulnerability, and threats. Scenario development and visualization at each level of MS&amp;A is also sought. Research into new simulation toolsets and architectures designed for this purpose will also be considered.

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 9 - TARGET VULNERABILITY AND WEAPON EFFECTIVENESS (RWPL)</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to collect data, conduct research, develop/modify and employ responsive modeling tools, target models, and processes as part of AFRL's R&amp;D efforts. These efforts will identify potential vulnerabilities in targets and their subcomponents for conventional or concept weapons to exploit. They will also enable understanding and predictive capability for the effectiveness of inventory, developmental, and conceptual munitions when deployed against targets and critical components. Targets of interest can include but are not limited to mobile, fixed (above and below ground), hard and deeply buried, chem-bio and air-to-air. This research will allow development of new techniques or enhancement of existing techniques to measure and compare weapon effectiveness, collateral damage, and potential collateral hazards. Research will include improvements in our ability to predict and measure component vulnerability and functional defeat allowing assessment of weapon effects that degrade a target's ability to perform its intended functions without necessarily destroying it. It could also include research and modeling of new or conceptual damage mechanisms. Development of new target and associated functional models would improve our abilities to exploit high interest targets or newly discovered vulnerabilities. Research to enhance or develop methodology to account for the target critical equipment/components, and their interconnections, and associated failure logic and failure modes could be required. Tools of interest include, but are not limited to AJEM, ARM, BLASTX, BRL-CAD, Endgame Framework, FastCD, FASTGEN, FATEPEN, IMEA, JWS, MEVA, ORCA, PENCURV, PDAM, STEP, STMG, VALUE, WEAPS, and WinBLAST. White papers and proposals should be designed to demonstrate substantive knowledge in any or all of the specific areas of weapon testing, experimentation and weapon effectiveness and target vulnerability MS&amp;A. Some or all of the work performed under this BAA Research Area will be classified. Approved classified processing capabilities and security clearances at the SECRET level as a minimum will be required.</p>

<p><br /><strong>RESEARCH AREA 10 - WEAPON/TARGET MECHANICS (RWPC)</strong></p>
<p>The performance assessment and development of advanced conventional weapon systems requires the capabilities to model complex weapon/target interaction phenomena and to predict environments produced by impacting, penetrating, and detonating warheads. Modeling may be achieved with simplified engineering models or system/subsystem analysis codes, but the emphasis of this effort is the development and validation of continuum mechanics codes yielding high fidelity weapon and target models. Areas of particular interest include penetration mechanics, high strain rate fracture dynamics and constitutive modeling, modeling the shock survivability of fuze<br />electronic components, predictive models for the change in material properties due to thermal cycling (energetics and electronics), fragmentation, mesoscale modeling (metals and energetics), localized shear band formation, high pressure/high strain rate modeling of geologic and geologically derived materials, modeling of reacting droplet and particulate flows, equation of state and constitutive models for chemical and biological agents, numerical modeling of neutralization mechanisms for biological and<br />chemical agents, hydrodynamic ram, atomization and aerosolization of chemical and biological agents, direct numerical simulation of detonations, coupled detonation physics and multi-phase flow, accurate and efficient boundary interface treatments, the ability to span several orders of magnitude in spatial and temporal length scales, and advanced numerical methods. Innovative theoretical, computational and experimental projects that specifically address the problems of interest and result in an improved predictive capability are the goal.</p>

<p>RWMW is interested in all aspects conventional munitions warhead technology as it relates to the destruction, damage, defeat, or denial of function. Technologies and concepts are sought for a robust and affordable capability of air-launched munitions in the areas of: hard and deeply buried targets, fixed ground targets, mobile ground vehicles, air dominance, chemical/biological/radiological/nuclear/explosive (CBRNE) neutralization or access denial, and cybernet neutralization. Additionally, there is interest in specialized diagnostics, techniques, and experimental methods for the development and validation of these capabilities. Technical interests within the Hard Target Effects technical competency are in penetration mechanics, materials for surviving high speed penetration of geologic and cementitious materials, abrasion resistance, terradynamic stability, innovative case structures and composites, and production methods. Fundamental science studies in high rate particulate flow and meso-scale modeling is an area of emphasis. The Damage Mechanisms Science technical competency has interests in miniature and micro warheads, multifunctional energetic materials and damage mechanisms, directional control and focused effects, selectable effects, and collateral damage control. Approaches in all of these areas are not to be limited to traditional nor classical blast-fragmentation effects. Novel concepts of target defeat are encouraged to augment or replace the more traditional kinetic energy methods.</p>

<p><br /><strong>RESEARCH AREA 12 - FUZE RESEARCH (RWMF)<br /></strong>RWMF develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies that have application to fuzes for air-delivered weapons, including, but not limited to, guided and unguided bombs, missiles, and submunitions. Fuzes must reliably remain in a safe mode until the appropriate post-deployment environments (such as freefall) are sensed; the fuze must then arm the weapon and, upon receiving a signal from a target detection device (TDD), initiate the explosive fill (or other damage mechanism). RWMF thus seeks proposals for innovative technologies that can be integrated into the design or testing of air-delivered weapon fuzes.<br />RWMF is particularly interested in fuzes (including submunition fuzes) and related technologies that are capable of surviving the repetitive, multi-axis shock environment experienced by a fuze during penetration of a hardened target and functioning the warhead through cockpit-selectable time delay functions and advanced post-impact environmental sensing. However, current test technologies do not fully duplicate the multi-axial fuze environment in terms of duration, repetitive high-acceleration loading, and other aspects of the mechanical loading profile. This necessitates extremely expensive sled tests for fuze research, testing, qualification, and performance evaluation. Therefore, a need exists for laboratory and field test techniques and equipment to duplicate these repetitive, multi-axial shocks.<br />Some additional penetration fuzing-specific research tasks of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:<br />- Develop a jam-resistant, greater than 250 kilobits/second shock-hardened wireless Data Link for two-way communication with a fuze during a weapon's deep underground penetration event;<br />- Investigate methods/techniques for improving the shock survivability of inventory hardened fuzes (FMU-143, FMU-152) used in penetrating weapons; e.g., techniques for eliminating gaps/air voids between the fuze and fuzewell;<br />- Develop a hardened, passive, unpowered, tri-axial device that irreversibly and measurably changes some physical configuration or property without relaxation/hysteresis to record the peak acceleration as a back-up data point for tests when a hardened fuze data recorder fails;<br />- Develop a low-cost (&lt;$100), shock-hardened accelerometer;<br />- Develop non-inertial techniques and appropriate devices for detecting voids and layers during hard target penetration; and<br />- Develop a miniature passive or active sensor capable of identifying case breakup and/or severe trajectory instability during a hardened penetration event for the purpose of salvaging the fuze function and high explosive detonation-this technology must operate inside an existing fuze well as an add-on to existing fuze components and have low false alarm rate.</p>
<p>RWMF is also interested in improved sensors, techniques, and/or systems for second safety environment sensing for gravity released general-purpose bombs. For example, an improvement or replacement for the FZU-32, -48, etc., would be of significant interest. <br />In the area of miniature and micro-munition fuzing, research tasks of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:<br />- Reliable miniature three port air valve that has a wide temperature operating range (-55 to +75 degree C) <br />- Ground profiling fuze sensor technology<br />- Active imaging aimpoint selecting fuze sensor technology<br />The final area of focused interest is in the area of in-line and out-of-line initiation systems. RWMF Initiation Science and Technology group is interested in novel ignition devices or ignition circuitry that can enhance reliability while reducing energy budgets for initiation systems. Additionally, concepts that would enable novel warhead designs are of interest. We are also interested in novel or more inherently robust manufacturing processes that can be applied to components within initiation systems. Finally, there is interest in methods or techniques for characterizing performance of those systems.</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 13 - ADVANCED ENERGETICS (RWME)</strong></p>
<p>Advanced energetics research proposals are of particular interest. This topic includes development of more energetic materials and/or combinations of materials including nanometric explosives as well as other high energy density materials. Reactive materials comprising metastable interstitial composites (MICs) and/or metal fuels in combination with oxidizers and explosives are also included. Constitutive modeling of these materials, including mesoscale descriptions of their dynamic mechanical response, initiation mechanisms and reactive equations of state are included as well. Novel approaches for formulating, processing, enhancing the mechanical properties (i.e., strength, toughness) and characterizing the special features of novel energetic materials and functionally graded materials in terms of their performance and energy release benefits are also of interest.</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 14 - FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT ENABLING MICRO MUNITIONS AND ADVANCED ENERGETICS (RWME)</strong></p>
<p>AFRL/RW anticipates a need for new, improved, and often unique facilities and equipment to support expanding future in-house RDT&amp;E (research, development, test, and evaluation) work especially in the areas of micro munitions and advanced energetic. This work will require facilities with the capability to work with energetic nano materials that may also be classified as an explosive. These new RW facilities and equipment will enable world class research, development, integration, fabrication and testing of future prototype munitions system concepts demonstrating emerging micro munition and advanced energetics technologies. Developing concepts and preliminary designs for these new and unique facilities as well as for much of the new equipment to be used in these facilities will need to be approached as research and development projects, not as just design projects. New control/monitoring techniques and equipment will be required to simultaneously meet HVAC requirements for working with nano materials that are also an explosive especially in areas where a clean room environment is required. Of particular interest are proposals for preliminary feasibility studies; concept development, assessment, evaluation, preliminary design and associated cost estimates/presentation material for the new facilities and/or new research equipment that will be required to pursue this evolution of energetics from conventional explosives to reactive materials and nano energetics and munitions from the current conventional munitions to micro munitions. Also of interest are proposals for structural response calculations/modeling, design analysis, and design needed to support Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) submittals/presentations required for explosives siting approval of new facilities to be located at one of RW's remote explosives locations. This topic includes work to advance the understanding of nano energetic material effects on both the human body and the environment as well as work relating to the understanding, interpretation, and assessment of present and likely future applicable environmental, safety, and health requirements/regulations that would relate to nano energetics. A need is anticipated for developing new systems/components that will enable the new facilities and equipment to meet these emerging future requirements/regulations.</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 15 - Multi-function Multi-mode RADAR RESEARCH (RWGS)</strong></p>
<p>RWG has an interest in developing innovative multifunction radar systems that lend themselves to a variety of applications for both munitions and Combat UAV's. There is a need for generating multi mode seeker systems where RF is one of the modes that can provide the weather capability and be amalgamated innovatively with IR, EO or Ladar modes in order to provide improved ATR and aim point selection to the munitions seeker system. There is also the interest of creating small munitions seeker and sensor technologies that would provide low cost solutions for creating submunitions seekers. These seekers are to be integrated into a 20 pound munitions full-up-round, for creating smart guided submunitions that can be incorporated into a larger cluster munition for dispensing in a target rich environment. These submunitions require weather capability, and innovative miniature RF solutions are of great interest. There is also interest in developing a Noise/ LPI radar seeker that can provide the capability of not being detected. These seekers must provide the function of detecting, acquiring, tracking, and engaging targets with a very small probability of being detected. The interest also extends to hypersonic and high speed environments. The high speed environment provides interesting requirements that provide great opportunities for innovations in materials implementation, apertures, component technologies and processing. RWG is also interested in dome technology and dome materials for these high speed applications. Concepts and innovative ideas for solutions to these different seeker applications are also of interest. The various seeker applications listed above have many implications of RF components, aperture technology ( conformal, broadband, electronically steered, mechanically steered, concentric apertures), real time processing, miniaturization of subsystems, etc. Signal processing techniques for these various seeker technology described, and the ability to detect, track, and engage targets is of interest. The seeker systems listed above are also expected to provide good measurements for the purpose of guiding the munitions, or CUAC to the intended target. Along with this is the ability to provide measurements or information for the use of classifying the target once reacquired. Another interest is in the seeker system being able to provide fuzing information that would lend itself for an innovative approach for Guidance integrated Fuzing (GIF) applications.</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 16 - REVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH (RW)</strong></p>
<p>This research area is intended to cover, in general nature, all revolutionary research areas of interest to this Directorate. AFRL/RW is interested in revolutionary munitions-related research that has the potential to create new<br />airframe, ordnance, and guidance and control technology weapon paradigms. One of the goals of this program is to develop highly innovative solutions relating to munitions ordnance packages and airframe technology for the purpose of defeating a variety of targets including fixed and moving targets, hard and soft targets, and above ground and deeply buried targets. Ideas and concepts are sought that represent new approaches - lethal and non-lethal - to defeat these targets. With this type of revolutionary thinking, as opposed to evolutionary, order of magnitude increases in performance may be realized.</p>
<p>The military payoff would be in terms of significant munitions weight and size<br />reduction, reduced weapon cost, and improved effectiveness. Non-lethal<br />approaches also have the benefit of disabling enemy capabilities with reduced<br />loss of life.</p>
<p>Another goal of this research area is to develop highly innovative concepts and<br />approaches in guidance and control technologies for air-deliverable autonomous munitions. This program may develop advanced concepts in such areas as electro-optical, infrared, millimeter wave, and radio frequency seeker technology with the components and signal/image processing systems used in such seekers. Advanced concepts in the guidance, navigation and control (GN&amp;C) of munitions airframes will also be sought. The basic seeker&nbsp; technologies to be considered include: sensing materials, sensing elements for target characterization, autonomous target acquisition algorithms, signal and image processing algorithms, and multi-sensor data fusion algorithms. The basic GN&amp;C technologies include: miniature inertial measurement units (IMUs), Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, jam resistant GPS, and micro-electro-mechanical system based sensing and control cooperative attack algorithms. In addition to advancements in the basic technology, revolutionary<br />changes that shift current or create new guidance and control paradigms will be<br />developed.</p>

<p><strong>V. WHITE PAPER REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Criteria:</strong> The following four criteria and an assessment of risk will be used to determine whether full proposals will be invited based on the white paper submitted. The Government reserves the right to select all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds. These criteria and proposal risk for schedule discussed in paragraph 2 below will also be used to evaluate formal proposals, should they be requested.</p>
<p>The following factors are listed in descending order of importance. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. <br /><br /><strong>1. Evaluation Criteria:<br /><br /></strong>a. An integrated assessment of the proposed technical approach to include scientific and/or technical merits and the potential contributions of the effort to extending the scientific understanding associated with the technologies being pursued by the four AFRL/RW Divisions and described in the 16 research areas. <br />b. The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposed project objectives presented in the white paper/formal proposal. <br />c. The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposed project objectives presented in the white paper/formal proposal. <br />d. The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror if any, and the availability of funds (i.e., considering budgets and funding). Cost/Price is a substantial factor but is ranked as the fourth order of priority.</p>
<p><strong>2. Proposal Risk Assessment</strong>: Proposal risk for technical and cost will be assessed for white papers and formal proposals, should they be requested, as part of the evaluation of the above evaluation criteria. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential scientific benefit. Additionally for formal proposals, proposal risk for schedule will be evaluated. This relates to an assessment of the risks associated with the offeror's proposed number of hours, labor categories, materials, or other cost elements as it relates to meeting the proposed period of performance.</p>
<p>Individual white papers will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers submitted under this BAA. White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>It is the policy of AFRL/RW to treat all white papers as privileged information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. White papers will be subject to an evaluation by highly qualified Government scientists. The offeror must appropriately indicate any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the white paper (see also paragraph IV.B. above). Should white papers be selected and full proposals requested, the proposal is subject to incorporation into a resulting contract and is therefore releasable under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) unless specifically exempt or portions of the proposal are exempt under FOIA .</p>
<p><strong>B. Review and Selection Process</strong>: The evaluation described above will generally result in white papers being placed in one of the three categories below:</p>
<p><strong>1. Category I</strong>: Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the AFRL/RW technology research areas, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.<br /><br /><strong>2. Category II</strong>: Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.</p>
<p><strong>3. Category III:</strong> Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.</p>
<p><strong>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Award Notices (White Papers):</strong> Offerors of those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the Contracting Officer. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting offeror will be awarded a contract.

<p><strong>B. Communication:</strong> Dialogue between prospective offerors and Government representatives is encouraged until submission of proposals. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p><strong>C. Debriefings:</strong> Contractors whose white papers or proposals are not selected for further consideration/award, may request a debriefing. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016).</p>
<p><strong>D. Wide Area Work Flow Notice:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. The clause cites three possible electronic formats through which to submit electronic payment requests. Effective 1 October 2006, the Department of Defense adopted Wide Area Work Flow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA), as the electronic format for submission of electronic payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system. Information regarding WAWF-RA, including the web-based training and registration, can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil/ . Note: WAWF-RA requirement does not apply to universities that are audited by an agency other than DCAA.</p>
<p><strong>E. Item Identification and Valuation:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Aug 2008) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the Government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "the Government's unit acquisition cost is the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the Government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the Government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee.). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/sitemap.html .</p>
<p><strong>F. Forward Pricing Rate Agreements:</strong> If formal proposals are requested, offerors who have Forward Pricing Rate Agreements (FPRAs) and Forward Pricing Rate Recommendations (FPRRs) should submit them with their proposals.</p>
<p><strong>G. Pre-Award Clearance:</strong> Pursuant to FAR 22.805, a pre-award clearance must be obtained from the U.S. Department Of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Office Of Federal Contract Compliance Program's (OFCCP) prior to award of a contract (or subcontract) of $10,000,000 or more unless the contractor is listed in OFCCP's National Preaward Registry http://www.dol-esa.gov/preaward. This registry indicates that the contractor has been found to be "in compliance" within the past 2 years with the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) regulations that the OFCCP is mandated to enforce. The registry is updated nightly and facilities reviewed more than 2 years ago are removed and new ones are added. Award may be delayed if you are not currently listed in the registry and the contracting officer must request a pre-award clearance from the OFCCP.</p>
<p><strong>H. Excessive Pass-Through Charges:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.215-7004, Excessive Pass-Through Charges, (May 2008) which requires the contractor to identify in its proposal the percentage of effort to be performed by the prime contractor and the percentage expected to be performed by each subcontractor. If the contractor intends to subcontract more than 70% of the total cost of work under the contract or task order, then it shall identify the amount of the contractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the contractor. If any subcontractor intends to subcontract to a lower tier subcontractor more than 70% of the total cost of its work, then it shall identify the amount of the subcontractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the lower tier subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the subcontractor. <br /><br /><strong>I. Associate Contractor Agreements:</strong> Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) are agreements between contractors working on Government contract projects that specify requirements for them to share information, data, technical knowledge, expertise, or resources. The Contracting Officer may require ACAs when contractors working on separate Government contracts must cooperate, share resources or otherwise jointly participate in working on contracts or projects.

<DESC>Amendment W91ZLK-12-R-0009 0002 is issued to provide answers to questions and clarifications.  The closing date of the solicitation has been extended to February 29, 2012 at 4:30 PM, Eastern Standard Time.  Please submit your proposals to Ms. Susan Sowa at the Army Contracting Command Aberdeen Proving Ground, Installation Contracting Division, 4118 Susquehanna Avenue, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005-3013.  Proposals may be submitted via email to:  susan.l.sowa.civ@mail.mil or Fax 410-306-3726. Proposals must be signed, dated, and received by the closing date.   Please reference both attachments for this RFQ.  Attachment for REVISEDSpecifications and Attachment2 for revised Description of the Requirement CLIN structure. NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE HONORED.<br><br>Question 10:   What are the true min. specs you need for this specific application?  <br><br>Answer 10:  The minimum requirements are based on require projector peak outputs. We have determined that only those projectors in the 6000 - 8000 lumens range are capable of providing sufficient brightness for our test items and instrumentation requirements. <br><br>Require the following options:<br><br>Projection Designs F32 brand name or equal:<br>Color Wheel: Graphics<br>Resolution: WUZGA (1920 X 1200)<br>Lens: Lens number	EN11 / 503-0056-00<br>  	Focus range	2 - 15 m<br>	Throw ratio	1.60 - 2.32 : 1 (WUXGA)<br><br>The Focus range is 2 - 15m, this lens combination works best when we tested it at our facility. The actual distance to the projection screen is 18m (60ft). The color wheel and resolution options that we selected spec out at 4500 lumens, but we would still have the option (if we ever needed too) to switch to a high bright color wheel which specs out at 7500 lumens with our selected resolution and the 8000 lumens projector. <br><br><br>If an "or equal projector" is proposed for a different type or brand of projector, the specs based on our "brand name" projector/lens/color-wheel combination would only serve as a rough guide. Color wheels are projector vendor specific and light output varies depending on the technology in the product. So we are specifying a 6,000-8,000 lumens projector. All projectors meeting the attached listed specifications must pass an onsite technical evaluation to confirm static and moving target positioning accuracy, and verify that they are capable of providing sufficient brightness, and contrast to allow existing instrumentation (contrast video trackers) as well as weapon system (test item) auto-trackers to successfully lock on and track targets over various tracking scenarios (with variations in visibility and terrain backgrounds), prior to accepting the projectors as technically acceptable.<br><br>Question 11:  Standard warranty on the F32 WUXGA is only 2 years, are you looking for a 1 year parts and labor, that should be added as a CLIN?<br><br>Answer 11:  Change warranty requirement to read 2 year manufacture warranty instead of 3 year manufacture warranty.<br><br>Question 12:  In the specification sheet attached you are requesting 6000-8000 Lumens, while in the attachment 2 file you are requesting 4500 Lumens.<br><br>Answer 12:  Please reference Question 10 and Answer 10.<br><br>Question 13:  The request for 7500:1 contract ratio limits the option and kind of directs the bid to a certain brand name. <br>Answer 13: This requirement is based on the peak output value for the projector. Any projector with equal or better peak values would qualify for an onsite evaluation.<br>.<br> <br>Question 14:  Also please note "color management" feature is only supplied by one company called Projector Design and is not available from other suppliers.  <br><br>Answer 14: This requirement is not included in the minimum projector requirements. This service/feature was requested based on the manufacturer's recommendations for the F32 projector - it is not a requirement for any other projector model or brand.<br><br>

What constitutes a fully coordinated transition plan?  <br><br>Government Answer:<br><br>As with any Broad Agency Announcement, offerors are encouraged to provide the information necessary to substantiate that their abilities to achieve the goals the Government sets out in the solicitation.  Offerors responding to this BAA should use their best judgment in providing the information necessary for the Government to determine the state of coordination of their proposed CTP solution with the both the Government and Industry PMOs substantiating progress of coordination, as well as a plan to fully coordinate a TTP during CTPD.  Please reference the technical proposal preparation instructions, specifically the areas of Sections 2-5 that discuss transition, as well as the evaluation criteria 1-3 that show how transition will be evaluated for additional guidance.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<BR><BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products.<BR><BR>(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] [  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. [  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture.

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly? (1) [ ] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or<BR><BR>(2) [ ] Outside the United States. (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.<BR><BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror?s relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals?

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products.<BR><BR>(2) Certification.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.<BR><BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<BR><BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products.<BR><BR>(2) Certification.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC>Amendment #3 provide answers to the following contractor questions:
Q: Are there any specific components for the submittal? Comparable projects? References? Resumes? Cover letter? A: It is the contractor's decision as to the components to submit in response to the solicitation. Items submitted should correlate to the contractor's ability to meet the specified evaluation criteria.
Q: Is there a preferred length for the submittal? How much detail is required for pricing?   A: While there is no preferred or maximum length for offers, please be reasonable in your response, keeping in mind that this is a simplified acquisition. In terms of detail required for pricing, the contractor must at a minimum provide a price for the 4 line items identified in the combined synopsis/solicitation.  
Q: Do team members need to have specific experience with the history and archeology of the specific parks? Or is it more important to have experience working with historical and archeological collections? How much detail do you require in resumes about our specific experience?A: Please review the evaluation criteria listed in the combined synopsis/solicitation carefully. As stated, the level of detail required is for the contractor to determine and must provide enough information for the technical team to review and evaluate accordingly. While the contractor does not have to have specific experience with the history and archeology of the specific parks, they do need to have experience working with/planning for/knowledge of these types of collections and how they relate to remote, resource-rich parks.  
Q: Will the bulk of the work take place in Anchorage or in King Salmon? Can you estimate days in each location so we can better calculate our costs?A: We estimate Monday July 30-Friday Aug. 3 will be in Anchorage, fly out Friday or Saturday Aug. 4 to King Salmon, where we will remain until Friday Aug. 10, when we fly back to Anchorage. We will go to Brooks Camp if the weather permits for a day trip while we are in King Salmon.
Q: Will transportation be provided to Brooks Camp? Or is that the contractor's responsibility?A: Transportation to Brooks Camp will need to be provided by the contractor. There is a very slim possibility that the park boat can take the team out to Brooks Camp, but they need to budget for a flight to Brooks from King Salmon.
Q: Is any travel anticipated to Aniakchak National Monument? If so, will we need to budget for that?A: No travel to Aniakchak National Monument is anticipated.
Q: Should the travel expenses be separate or included as part of the site visit price? A: All travel expenses should be incorporated into the appropriate line item of the combined synopsis/solicitation (i.e. Line item 001). 
Q: Can you identify specific Issue Statement Chapters that the contractor will be responsible for in addition to "Natural History, Collection History, and Archives" which we understand will be developed by NPS staff?A: The Issue Statement Chapters that the contractor will be responsible for will be jointly determined at the site visits. These chapters are somewhat standardized, but vary based on the museum collection and cannot be completely identified prior to the site visit.

Reduced-sized systems will provide an alternative to full-size systems to help reduce the AIT-2s overall footprint for smaller checkpoint configurations. &nbsp; <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SSI:<br /></strong></span><br />Portions of this RFP contain Sensitive Security Information (SSI).&nbsp; All&nbsp;Contractors&nbsp;interested in responding to the AIT-2 solicitation must go through a vetting process and be approved to have access to SSI.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Contractors who have been successfully vetted under the Pre-Solicitation Notice instructions will have SSI sent to the given Senior Corporate Official e-mail address.&nbsp; <br /><br />Contractors that have not been vetted under the Pre-Solicitation Notice and are interested in responding to the AIT-2 solicitation should review the SSI Clearance Information <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within the attached RFP document</span>&nbsp;and respond as appropriate.&nbsp; Please note that the clearance process can take several weeks.<br /><br />Contractors&nbsp;that submit SSI vetting information prior to the deadline&nbsp;within the attached RFP document should receive correspondence from TSA by March 19, 2012 5:00 PM EST.&nbsp; Please e-mail the Primary and Secondary Point of Contact in this Solicitation Notice if a submission was made&nbsp;prior to&nbsp;the deadline in&nbsp;attached RFP document and the March 19, 2012&nbsp;date passes.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>CNSI:<br /><br /></strong></span>Portions of this RFP contain Classified National Security Information (CNSI).&nbsp; Contractors must have a facility clearance (FCL) at the Secret level and a DD Form 254 from the Government.&nbsp; The Government will use the Contractor's CAGE code to determine the Contractor's FCL status.&nbsp; Only after receipt of DD Form 254 with appropriate FCL status will Contractors be&nbsp;provided (by mail)&nbsp;the related CNSI information.&nbsp; <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Pre-Solicitation Conference:<br /><br /></span></strong>An AIT-2 Pre-Solicitation Conference&nbsp;will be held on March 9, 2012 from 8:30 am to 12 noon at the TSA Systems Integration Facility (TSIF) in Washington, D.C.&nbsp;In order to attend, Contractors must be vetted and approved to have access to SSI because SSI will be presented at the Pre-Solicitation Conference.<br /><br />Those Contractors interested in attending the AIT-2 Pre-Solicitation Conference that have not been vetted under the&nbsp;Pre-Solicitation Notice should review the SSI Clearance Information <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within the attached RFP document</span> and respond as appropriate immediately in order to permit the initiation of the clearance process.&nbsp; Please note that&nbsp;while a best effort will be undertaken to complete the process, TSA does not guarantee completion of the clearance process, nor does TSA guarantee access to the AIT-2 Pre-Solicitation Conference for any Contractor which did not complete vetting and receive approval for access to SSI under the Pre-Solicitation Notice.&nbsp; <br /><br />Once approved for access to SSI, and no later than March 1, 2012, Contractors should provide the Primary and Secondary Point of Contact in this Solicitation Notice the names and phone numbers of no more than&nbsp;two (2)&nbsp;individuals cleared for access to SSI that plan on attending the AIT-2 Pre-Solicitation Conference.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>NOTE:&nbsp; All information above is considered the Solicitation Notice.&nbsp; All information below is considered the Pre-Solicitation Notice.<br /><br /></strong>Added: Dec 09, 2011 1:31 pm <br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), intends to compete its requirement for a second generation of Advanced Imaging Technology-2 (AIT-2). The AIT-2 system is used as a primary screening device to inspect a passenger's body for concealed weapons (metal and non-metal), explosives and other prohibited items. AIT takes into account passenger privacy considerations and employs safeguards to provide the maximum level of privacy protection to passengers. AIT is being upgraded to include Automated Target Recognition (ATR) capability which reduces privacy concerns and decreases passenger processing time. AIT-2 may also serve as a platform for potential integration of metal detection and/or shoe scanning capability.</p>

<p>8. Coast Guard aircraft operate primarily in a saltwater environment and are subject to corrosion. Corrosion is expected on equipment to be repaired under this contract. During inspection and functional test, the presence of corrosion in any component or subcomponent thereof shall constitute reason for a more thorough disassembly and inspection. Should corrosion be found, disassembly shall be made only to the extent necessary to remove corrosion or replace the part(s) affected. Corroded parts shall be replaced except in those cases where removal of corrosion from a part will not impair efficiency or safe operation of the part.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U S Coast Guard, 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, D. C. 20593-7112, Telephone (202) 372-3695.The following FAR clauses apply to this solicitation, and Offerors may obtain full text versions of these clauses electronically at http://www.arnet.gov/far: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offeror-Commerical Items (JUN 2008).

<p>Description</p>
<p>The AFNWC/PKOD will be soliciting a Competitive 8(a) Set-Aside, Firm Fixed Price Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) to provide indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity and design-build construction efforts to support the 377 MSG/CE mission at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico. Competition will be restricted to companies with a bona fide place of business in the State of New Mexico, SBA's Acceptance Letter #0682/12/201593/01. A determination/approval of a bona fide place of business must be acquired through the Small Business Administration. Current A&amp;E contractors on contract at Kirtland AFB are not permitted to participate. Foreign contractors will not be permitted to participate at the prime contractor level. This acquisition will encompass requirements that have, in the past, been acquired utilizing the Base Maintenance Contract. Individual Task Order work will consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories and execute a broad range of maintenance, repair, minor and/or new construction. Task Order limits will be $2,000 to $3,000,000. The contractor shall provide all material, equipment, labor and general conditions to accomplish design, maintenance, repair, and minor construction projects in an expeditious manner. The maximum program value (combined value of all task orders from all awarded contracts) is not to exceed $64M over a five-year period. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods.</p>
<p><br />Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 Construction, Subsection 236 Construction of Buildings size standard $33.5M and Subsection 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, size standard $33.5M. The work may include facility upgrades, utility work, airfield pavement, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects. The construction work includes tasks in various trades such as carpentry, asbestos abatement and removal, demolition, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete masonry, welding, painting, roofing and paving. Locations of work will be at Kirtland AFB, NM. Offers are solicited only from business concerns current in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)<br />Code 236220 must specifically be included in the Offerors approved business plan.</p>
<p>A Request for Proposal (RFP) is contemplated utilizing best value source selection procedures described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 215.3, Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.3 and MP 5315.3, targeted toward a Competitive 8(a) set-a-side with a 30-day response time (offers due 30 days after issuing). In using this approach, the Government seeks to award up to six (6) contracts to 8(a) small businesses, who give the Air Force the greatest confidence that they can meet the requirements for up to 100% design and construction expertise on infrastructure renovation, repair, new construction, roads, and/or airfield work. The solicitation will include a design/build seed project that will be used to evaluate these capabilities. The seed project consists of a facility expansion, LRPD Advanced HPM Research Facility Expansion (Project # MHMV 110112). The seed project magnitude is between $1,000,000 to $5,000,000.</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possess sufficient technical expertise and experience, possess sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements shall be achieved and costs shall be controlled. Kirtland AFB plans to include the following factors:</p>
<p>1) Technical/Technical Risk<br />2) Past Performance<br />3) Cost/Price</p>
<p>Within the Technical/Technical Risk Factor the following 4 sub-factors will be used:</p>
<p>a) Organizational Structure and Staffing <br />b) Technical Capability/Execution and Completeness of the Seed Project<br />c) Change and Cost Control Management<br />d) Quality Control Program</p>
<p>The Technical/Technical Risk and Past Performance factors will be afforded primary emphasis in the evaluation, are considered equal in importance, and, when combined, are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor. Cost/Price, however, will contribute substantially to the selection decision and will be assessed for reasonableness. The sub-factors within the Technical/Technical Risk Factor are considered equal in importance.</p>
<p>Up to six (6) highest rated offerors from the source selection will receive a basic contract award. The highest rated offeror will be awarded the seed project, which satisfies the contract minimum requirement. All remaining awardees will be awarded an initial $2,000 Task Order for the MACC Orientation Seminar to satisfy the contract minimum requirement. All future task orders will be competed among all the contract awardees.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 9 March 2012 and close on or about 30 calendar days thereafter. No hard copies will be provided. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the website for any and all amendments to this solicitation. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before award of a government contract; failure to register in the CCR database may cause your firm to be ineligible for award.</p>

Prospective manufacturers/vendors may be required to warrant that items they supply will perform satisfactorily when used in the intended application by the military.  This Market Survey does not guarantee a contract by the Government.  For more information, contact Susan Tyndall, preferably via email at susan.tyndall@us.army.mil or phone (443) 395-7013.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAVAIR WD), China Lake, CA issued a modification that extended the period of performance of contract N68936-05-C-0083. The contract is for System Configuration Set (SCS) support for the Marine Corps H-1 aircraft.  This action extend the period of performance of the current contract from 2 Mar 11 through 2 Mar 12.  There will be no increase to the level of effort or dollar value of the contract.  An SCS is a combination of software and hardware configuration items (CIs) that are integrated into a previously deployed baseline configuration and are delivered to the Fleet as highly integrated software and hardware packages.
  Delivery is FOB destination.  Delivery schedules are identified for each SCS.  As the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the AH-1 and UH-1 aircraft, Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. is the only source qualified to satisfy this requirement.  Bell has the unique integration capability needed to perform this effort and ensure compatibility between software and hardware systems due to ongoing changes, upgrades, and enhancements.  No solicitation was issued; however, a synopsis was posted in the FEDBIZOPPs from 122110 through 010411 and no response was received from any vendor, during the 15 day posting.

<AWARDEE>Markon, 400 S Maple Avenue
Suite 230
Falls Church, VA 22046, Falls Church, VA 22046 US
<DESC>This serves as a "Notice of Intent"  to award Option 2 (OY2) Project Management Office (PMO) Support for Intelligence Community Campus Bethesda MD, (ICC-B).
<p>The Virginia Contracting Authority intends to award Option 2 (OY2) on a competitively awarded IDIQ contract (No. HHM402-10-D-0034), in which the successful vendor is Markon (400 S Maple Street STE 230, Falls Church VA, 22046) in the amount of $3,500,000.</p>
<p>On the basis of a best value technical and price evaluation, award was made to Markon, Inc. a small business on 8 July 2010.  In accordance with the award, and its evaluated option, the Government has elected to continue performance in 2011 by awarding Task Order Number 2 under this IDIQ contract.</p>
<p>The exercise of the option is the most advantageous method of fulfilling the Government's need.  To re-compete this requirement is not warranted based on the vendor's last year of performance as being satisfactory and therefore, it is determined at the time most advantageous to the Government to exercise the option for another year.  <br />&bull;	A new solicitation would fail to produce a better price or a more advantageous offer than that offered by the option.<br />&bull;	The time between the award of the contract containing the option and the exercise of the option is so short that it indicates the option price is the lowest price obtainable or the more advantageous offer.<br />The need for continuity of services is important to the Government and should not be interrupted.  The services provided are in support of a mission critical requirement for the Agency.  The potential cost of disrupting service is considered substantial.  The need for continuity of services and the potential costs for the disruption of services far outweigh the benefits of contracting with source(s) other than the current contractor..</p>
<p>All interested parties should request additional information, communicate concerns, or direct any questions concerning this acquisition to Holly Carr 703 605 5588, email:  holly.carr@gsa.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, nor a solicitation for offers.  RE:  Note 22.</p>
