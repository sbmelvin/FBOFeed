<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to enter into a sole source purchase order award with Serco Assurance Inc. for annual license of WIMS8 software (Qty 2). 
	
The software will be used to perform independent confirmatory lattice physics analyses. The NRC requires a code that uses a cross section library that is different than the one being used in the analyses being assessed. The NRC also requires the ability to use different solution algorithms in our assessment.

<DESC>NA The Government proposes to award a contract to SRI International on a sole source basis for Exploratory Study of High Spin Carbonitroxyls.  DTRA has the responsibility to investigate and improve the performance of energetic materials.  New highly advanced energetic materials have the potential to substantially increase the performance of weapon systems in the near term and the promise of order of magnitude increases  in the mid to far term.  The research activities to be conducted are synthesis and x-ray cr ystallographic analysis of a new class of high spin carbonitroxyls which are expected to have exceptionally high enthalpies of formation.  DTRA has determined that only SRI has the prior knowledge and experience and speciality synthetic equipment needed to  conduct investigations and speciality synthetic equipment to conduct investigations and synthesis of proposed new materials.  No other laboratories are capable of synthesizing and characterizing high-spin carbonitroxyls.  Follow-on requirements are not cu rrently planned.  See note 22

<DESC>Please Note: This solicitation is being issued as a small business set-aside, NAICS code 541618. The Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) has a requirement for professional administrative support for revising chapters of the Personnel Management Manual (PMM). This requirement is being issued on behalf of DCAA by GovWorks under the franchise authority of the Department of the Interior. This procurement is being conducted under FAR Part 12 for commercial items. DCAA requires that complete and up-to-date Human Resource policies be available throughout the Headquarters, Regional, and field audit offices for use by management, supervisors, employees, and employee unions. This information must reflect the latest changes to law, regulation, and agency policy because it is used to make critical human resource decisions such as performance management, merit promotion, incentive awards, career development, disciplinary actions, reductions in force, etc. Such changes occur constantly and DCAA requires the services of a contractor to incorporate these changes into complete easy-to-understand policies for its PMM. DCAA requires professional administrative support for revising chapters and/or writing new chapters for its PMM. For those human resource program areas already covered by existing chapters of the PMM, DCAA requires the Contractor to perform research and translate new laws and regulations into draft changes and/or additions to those chapters and to coordinate the changes with the DCAA Project Manager. If new laws and/or regulations necessitate, the contractor will be required to perform the necessary research, draft, and coordinate new chapters for the PMM. The Contractor will also be required to consider comments/suggestions for changes provided as a result of the coordination, incorporate appropriate changes into the draft and prepare documentation apprising DCAA management of reasons for not including suggested changes. Contractor will follow Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for updating the PMM as provided by the DCAA Project Manager. The Agency Project Manager will determine the order in which the chapters are to be updated. Contractor employees will be required to meet all security and safety regulations pertinent to the work location. The duties associated with this effort have been determined to be non-critical sensitive, in accordance with DoD 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel Security Program. Contractor employees for this statement of work will be designated as non-critical sensitive and will require at a minimum a favorably adjudicated National Agency Check (NAC). Only U.S. citizens may be assigned work pursuant to this effort. Therefore, those appointed will be required to provide proof of citizenship as follows: Those born in the U.S. are required to provide an original or certified birth certificate. Those born outside of the U.S. may provide a Certificate of Naturalization, Certificate of Citizenship, Report of Birth Abroad, or a valid U.S. Passport. The period of performance is for one base year plus one option year. The Government will award a time and materials contract for this effort. Interested parties must fax AND email their request for the solicitation package to Jenny Taylor or Katherine Valltos at (703) 787-1009 (fax) and Jenny.Taylor@mms.gov, Katherine.Valltos@mms.gov. by 12:00 p.m., EST, June 21, 2002.

<DESC>NA The Government proposes to award a contract to General Sciences, Inc. (GSI) for Advanced Energetic Composites for Thermobaric Weapons.  DTRA has the responsibility to investigate and improve the performance of energetic materials.  New highly advanced ener getic materials have the potential to substantially increase the performance of weapon systems in the near term and hold the promise of order of magnitude increases in the mid- to far term.  Under the DTRA Advanced Energetic Program there is a need for mea surement of fundamental properties of titanium-boron and metal-hydride reactive materials.  DTRA has  determined that GSI has the required past experience, intellectual foundation, research experience and equipment needed, e.g. ball and jet milling, oxygen  fee synthetic equipment and scanning electron-microscope to conduct investigations on the proposed energetic materials.  In addition, the investigators have conducted research on nano sized A1, Ti, B, and A1/Mg as well as the hydrides of Ti, LiAl, LiB and  Mg composite materials for many years.  Follow on requirements are not currently planned.

<DESC>.   Multisensor Command and Control Constellation (MC2C) Request For Information (RFI) --- The Command and Control Enterprise Integration (C2EI) Office at Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Hanscom AFB is requesting information from industry for business approaches to obtain market research data to assist in developing MC2C preliminary acquisition planning.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  It is not a Request For Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication the US Air Force or ESC will contract for the items contained in the RFI.  ESC will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI. The C2EI Office is soliciting ideas from industry on alternative business approaches to develop and implement a standards-based open architecture to allow rapid exchange of decision quality data between the components of the MC2 Constellation.  For the purpose of this RFI, the AFROC-approved MC2 Functionality Mission Need Statement, MC2C Integrated Architecture and other related CONOPS are currently published on the Electronic System Center's Hanscom Electronic RFP Bulletin Board (HERBB) https://herbb.hanscom.af.mil/esc_opps.asp?rfp=R368  The C2EI Office requests industry comments/opinions concerning the following: 1.	Business or teaming approaches to bring the best technical expertise to bear on this complex integration effort. 2.	Suggested incentives the government could provide to industry to encourage teaming and innovation to best achieve MC2C horizontal integration objectives. 3.	Recommend Contract Types preferable for both a near term study phase as well as a long term Phase 2 contract.  Phase 1 could deliver Architecture views and identify enterprise and infrastructure improvements while Phase 2 could potentially involve activity to change/improve the Constellation for greatest return on investment and further mature the planning integration processes.

Proposal Submission Place:  Mr. Cui Guanglei, Director & Vice President, China Petrochemical International Co., Ltd. Building C, Anli Garden, No. 66 Anli St., Chaoyang District, Beijing 100101, CHINA Phone:  86-10-6490-7877, Fax: 86-10-6421-6972  :  

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study that would define the technical and financial requirements of an e-procurement system for Sinopec International, China?s leading trading company. The two goals of the feasibility study would be to determine (a) how Sinopec International should invest, organize its business, and train its staff to implement the e-procurement system and (b) what type of e-procurement system the firm should implement.  

Sinopec International is responsible for import and export activities related to Sinopec, its parent company, and handles the largest trade volume of any Chinese entity ($12.2 billion in 2000, reflecting $11 billion in imports and $1.2 billion in exports). With China?s accession into the WTO and the implementation of China?s 10th Five-Year Plan (2001-2005), demand for crude oil and petrochemical products now outpaces domestic supply.  Consequently, China will likely have to follow measures to conserve oil, find fuel substitutes, accelerate exploration and exploitation of oil and natural gas resources, and make effective use of overseas resources.

Given these circumstances, Sinopec International plans to acquire as much technology as possible through technical exchanges with their foreign counterparts, as well as accelerate procurement of conventional equipment and services for the petroleum and petrochemical industry, heavy vehicles for transportation, telecommunications infrastructure, iron & steel piping, instrumentation, chemical products and advanced gas sales systems.  To facilitate its procurement activities, Sinopec International plans to establish its own e-procurement platform.

The tasks that would be completed for the feasibility study by the U.S. firm include: (1) Recommendation for a Strategic Investment and Management Plan; (2) Recommendation for Technical Implementation; (3) Strategic Investment Plan for Sinopec International?s E-Procurement System; (4) Technical Specifications Plan for Sinopec International?s E-Procurement System; (5) Organizational Staff Development and Training Needs and Plans; (6) Legal Concerns for E-Procurement Systems; (7) Cultural Concerns for E-Procurement Systems; and (8) Financial Plan.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $429,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, August 5, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number 18-3K47-02, is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-07.    This acquisition will be procured on an unrestricted basis.  The Government intends to negotiate sole source with Amersham Bioscience Corp, 800 Centennial Ave., Piscataway, NJ 08855, pursuant to FAR Subpart 6.3.  The Government will award a firm-fixed-price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The USDA Alternate Crops and Systems Lab requires a Mega BACE 500 Sequencer and MegaBACE Flexible Genotyping Upgrade which is capable of using: both a 488nm Blue Argon laser and a 532nm Green He-Ne laser to excite the dyes, automated focusing (through the use of a photodiode assembly monitoring peak fluorescence intensity inside the capillaries), either ET primer or ET terminator (patented 4-color) sequencing chemistry, high viscosity linear polyacrylamide (optimal peak resolution), an epi-illumination system in which a patented flat-field confocal microscope lens is used to both focus the laser light onto the capillaries and collect the fluorescence for detection, high quality, physical, optical filter sets designed to accept only light in the correct wavelength during detection (minimizing background noise), dedicated photomultiplier tubes for sensitive light detection, an active (non static) color matrix; each run establishes a new color matrix minimizing errors due to voltage variations, optical alignment between runs, focusing differences, and non-achromatic system behavior, integrated quality control scores to alert the user to problematic areas of DNA sequence, integrated PHRED base scores as part of the software, an open-code html-based language for easy Internet transfer of data and in-house software integration.
There will be 3 primary users of the equipment and we will need the capability to do genotyping with microsatellities and AFLP in addition to sequencing capabilities.  Typical runs will involve  48 samples per scientist with the potential for all three scientist needing the equipment in a single day.  In establishing EST libraries sample number will start in the 1000s per month with the potential to reach 10,000 per year.  The capillary DNA analysis system must be capable of doing both genotyping and sequencing of 48 or more samples simultaneously.  We require run times of approximately 2 h for 48 DNA sequences greater than 500 bp in length with a high degree of accuracy.  The ability to run subsets of samples less than 48 without wasting material is also required.  The capability of analyzing sequence and genotyping (microsatellites and SNP's) samples without having to switch either the caps or the matrix is required to limit waste.  A confocal scanning detection systems is preferred because of increased accuracy of the resulting data.  Software providing for both sequence analysis and genotyping is also required for data analysis.  An active method of minimizing errors due to voltage variations, optical alignments between runs, focusing differences, and non-achromatic system behavior and integrated quality control scores to alert the user to problematic areas of DNA sequence are required along with an open-code html-based language for easy Internet transfer of data and in-house software integration.

<DESC>This synopsis advertises the Government's need for four (4) Azimuth/Elevation (Az/El) remotely controllable paraboloidal receive antenna systems for the new NOAA Satellite Operations Facility (NSOF) in Suitland, MD. The NSOF will house the antennas on its roof and is planned for early 2004. This advertisement is to conduct market research to define the approach for acquiring these systems, which are believed to be commercial items as defined in FAR 2.101, and to advertise the intent to release a solicitation. Each antenna system shall consist of: (a) the paraboloidal antenna; (b) a dual band - L/X feed sub-system; (c) dual redundant LNA paths for each feed; (d) an antenna local, operations area remote monitor/control, and external PC interface; (e) interconnecting cabling between the roof antenna and an operation control area, (f) dual redundant L-Band Downconverters, (g) 70 MHz Intermediate Frequency (IF) Distribution amplifiers, and  (h) an L-Band receiver. The X-Band receiver may be acquired separately. The system operational frequencies are L-Band: 1675 - 1710 MHz; X-Band 7450 - 8400 MHz. The following figures of merit are estimated, and potential interested Offerors are welcome to propose an alternate link budget: planned G/T: L-Band: 18.1 dB/K; X-Band: 31 dB/K (10 deg. Elev.). End-to-end amplitude is 1dB peak-to-peak. VSWR is at 1.2:1 over applicable operating frequency band. Control is in step-track, maintaining signal strength at +/- .25 dB, program track, and manual positioning. Drive system is required to provide pointing accuracy of +/- 10% of 3dB bandwidth at max. operating frequency in low wind (two-axis RMS Pointing error .020 deg.); +/- 20% of 3 dB, medium wind (two-axis RMS Pointing error .040 deg.); +/- 40% in high winds wind (two-axis RMS Pointing error .080 deg.). Max. velocity is .25 deg./sec/ AZ; .25 deg./sec. EL. Max. Accel. @ .25 deg./sec.2. The system must include a remote Control, Monitor, and Test sub-system (CMTs) operated by personal computer NIC interface, allowing remote position control, status assessment, or test of any of the four antenna systems. System hardware and CMT's must be based on off-the-shelf designs, equipment, and components with an extensively tested and stable operational heritage. Some customization of the CMT is likely. The future system will operate 24x7 with a 99.9 percent availability rate over its systems life cycle.  Also highly desirable is that the hardware systems be upgrade-able to accommodate technology refreshment as needed, without requiring substantive software re-programming, or causing a major disruption to the structure or other interfaced components, the antenna hardware/firmware, or the CMT system. The antennas will be installed, tested, and integrated on the roof of the NSOF (a web site is being constructed). The government will provide access to the new building's electrical power, signal and power grounding system, lightning protection, and signal conduits from the roof to the operations area. The CMTs shall be installed in a designated NSOF operations area. This solicitation is being conducted in accordance with Public Law 103-355 (41 U.S.C. 264 note), and the information herein is expressed as both a market survey and a presumed statement of need for a commercial item, as outlined in FAR 12.202, barring any information to the contrary.  The intent of this synopsis is to describe the required commercial items through the process described in FAR subpart 11.002 and also to identify any appropriate commercial practices. NOAA plans to tailor the provisions of FAR 52.212-1 and 52.212-4 to include addenda to the terms, estimated to include: financing provisions, if applicable; progress reporting requirements; standard Government test, inspection and acceptance procedures; and extended warranty-if applicable to commercial practices.  Respondents to this notice are requested to provide any necessary feedback on commercial terms and conditions, tracking and feed designs, and other performance traits such as pointing accuracy, surface tolerances, the gain distribution system, and a link budget for the performance capabilities contemplated that are common in this industry. The Government intends to streamline this acquisition using simplified acquisition procedures to the extent practicable.  The Market Survey responses are due at the location specified below (five paper copies and one electronic copy) by July 9, 2002. Designate those sections that are business proprietary and subject to exclusion from release under the FOIA. An RFP is anticipated for release o/a July 12, 2002. IMPORTANT!! Those interested in this requirement should contact Mr. Jay W. Moore, NPOESS/Integrated Program Office, 8455 Colesville Road, Suite 1450, Silver Spring, MD 20910; Tel. 301-427-2079, ext. 112, and provide full contact information.  No additional pre-RFP release notice is planned. A draft of the full specification is also planned for advance release to any interested potential offerors.  Requests for further information must be made by e-mail. See Note #25.

Prosecution of Work.  The Contractor's blading operations shall not continue when moisture conditions are not favorable for obtaining a satisfactory result.

Suitable moisture conditions are determined to be in excess of five (5) percent and less than fifteen (15) percent unless otherwise authorized by the COR.

When suitable moisture conditions exist, the Contractor shall proceed with blading and shaping within five days of notification by the COR. Failure of the Contractor to resume work within the specified time could subject the Contractor's right to proceed to immediate termination.


TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

Description - Road blading shall consist of the blading and shaping of the roadbed, including shoulders and turnouts, cleaning and shaping the drainage ditches, grade dips and water bars, to restore and maintain the original cross section and grade of the road, and includes removing ruts, washes, slough and other irregularities that prevent normal runoff from the road surface.

		The hydro-vac unit shall remove silt and        washed-in material from culvert catch basins back to their original grade line. Material in the culverts shall be removed from their entire length, and the outlet shall be free flowing. This cleaning shall be accomplished with the structures, in place. The Contractor shall not be allowed to wash or flush this material thru the culvert and onto the ground.  Material removed from the culverts and catch basins will be captured and placed as directed by the COR.	
 

 Methods - Blading

A.	Blading and shaping operations shall be performed in such a manner as to conserve existing materials. Blading of aggregate surfaced portions of the road shall be performed in such a manner that the base is not disturbed and no surface material is lost either in ditches or over the road shoulders. Blading on unsurfaced roads shall be performed in such a manner that no base material is lost.

B.	All ruts, chuckholes, and washes shall be removed by cutting to the bottom of such defects to provide for uniform compaction of roadbed material. High blading, which is merely filling the depressions with loose material, will not be acceptable.

C.	Settlement sections shall be repaired insofar as practicable by cutting from the roadbed on each end of the settled area and filling into the settled area to provide smooth transitions to adjacent road grades.

D.	Blading and shaping operations shall not undercut road backslopes.

E.	Surface material shall be bladed from one edge of the road to the other in a berm in order to eliminate any segregation prior to spreading. Sections having segregated materials after spreading shall be reprocessed and spread.

F.	On road sections constructed with a roadside ditch, the roadbed blading and shaping operations shall be performed so as to maintain crown at the centerline of the roadbed, except on curves where crown is omitted. Road cross section shall slope uniformly both ways from the crown apex to the shoulders at a minimum grade of two percent and a maximum grade of six percent.

G.	Road sections constructed without a roadside ditch shall be uniformly outsloped the entire width of the roadbed. The slope grade shall be a minimum of two percent and a maximum of five percent. Roads shall not be insloped unless approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.

H.	Existing drainage dips shall be cleaned and the outslope grade restored to equal or exceed the gradient of the road.

I.	On aggregate surfaced sections of the road, slough may be bladed across the road, provided it is not deposited in chuckholes, washes or ruts in the road surface. Such material shall be sidecast on stable fill slopes or natural ground out of streams, streambeds or other waterways. Care must be exercised so as not to contaminate the aggregate surface.

J.	Loose material located along the outside shoulder and along the ditch line of the road shall be salvaged and incorporated into the roadbed by windrowing on the road prior to shaping. The ditches shall be pulled and the material incorporated into the roadbed. Oversized material shall be feathered to the outside shoulder of the road so that there will be no berm or ridge in the completed road section.

K.	Widened roadway sections at curves, fills, and turnouts shall also be included with the blading of the roadway. The shoulder line shall be definite, continuous, and smooth, with no abrupt changes in alignment. Blading shall be done in such a manner to neither widen nor narrow the existing roadway.

L.	Existing aggregate surfacing material shall be bladed so as to conserve suitable surface material. Blading shall not be performed unless sufficient moisture is present to prevent segregation or enable compaction and/or blading shall not be performed when excess moisture prevents proper blending and compaction, as determined by the Contracting Officer and/or COR.

M.	Wood, rocks, and other debris shall be removed from roadside drainage ditches to provide unobstructed flow of water. The back slope of the ditch shall not be undercut by ditch cleaning operations. The slope to the road shoulder shall be maintained at an approximate ratio of 3:1 from the bottom of the ditch to the edge of the roadbed. Typical depth of roadside drainage ditches is one foot below roadbed. Existing ditch blocks shall be retained and reshaped as needed. 

N.	Rocks or other material remaining on the roadway surface after the final blading that fail to pass through a 3 inch sieve shall be removed (by hand if necessary) and side cast on the downhill road slope or disposed of as otherwise agreed.

O.	Cattleguards shall be left clean. No additional material may be deposited in the cattleguard.

P.	At the conclusion of the blading and shaping operations, the roadbed shall be smoothed and dressed up to produce a uniform grade and cross section, and a surface free of hollows, depressions and projections above the adjacent roadbed surface. No berm or ridge of any material shall be left along either shoulder of the roadbed unless directed by the Contracting Officer's Representative.

It is intended that this support will be procured for a period of three years with two option years. This market survey is being conducted in order to determine if adequate highly technical sources exists to set-aside the competition for small businesses or for eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are 8(a) certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA). All small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, service-disabled veteran owned small businesses and women-owned small businesses, as well as 8(a) certified businesses are encouraged to participate in this survey. In order to make a decision, the FAA will require the following information, in triplicate, ! from interested sources: 1.  Capability Statement - This statement should identify past performance references for the last three years for work performed of a similar type (limited to 5 pages). 2.  Resumes - These should be provided for those individuals that are expected to be identified as key personnel in a future proposal to a request for proposals. 3.  Programmatic approaches (In-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.). 4. Eligibility - If respondent is an eligible 8(a) certified business or other small business, provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent. NOTE - A minimum of 51% of the effort must be performed by the prime contractor. Teaming is encouraged. 5. Completion of the attached Business Declaration form. 6.  If applicable, a copy of the interested vendors 8(a) Certification Form. This should include all the required signatures and expiration dates. <P> Attached is the Statement of Work.

Your input is sought to determine if you have the expertise, interest, and capabilities to perform these tasks.  Submittals will be screened for technical acceptability. Additional work may be required as new systems are developed, or by organizational changes. Cost information is not requested. <P> This market survey is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment, or a promise of a contract by the Government. This market survey does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of responses. A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey does not necessitate exclusion from the competition. Failure of adequate, technically qualified, socially and economically disadvantaged business (8(a) certified), or other small business participation in this market survey, will result in a full and open competition opened to large businesses. The North Ameican Industry Classification Code (NAIC) for this effort is 541330 ($20 Million Size Standard). <P> Your response and capability statement must be submitted in writing, and may be hand-carried to Micheline Conn, Contracting Officer, Federal Aviation Administration, Room 502, 800 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC, or sent via facsimile at (202) 267-5460, or by E-mail to: micheline.conn@faa.gov not later than July 15, 2002  12 noon. <P>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order for Urology Testing to cover period 1 October 2002 to 30 September 2003 plus four option years to Urodynamics, 111080 Larimore Ave., Omaha, NE 68164.  Urology testing is required for proper diagnosis and treatment of a variety of urological and uro-gynocological conditions.  The 55th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because testing requires a Urodynamics, Inc. employee to be at the hospital to test patients on a weekly/daily basis.  Questions should be directed to SSgt Theresa Davis in writing via email:  theresa.davis@offutt.af.mil or by facsimile:  (402) 232-6571.

<DESC>NA The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP)'s in seeking to award one firm-fixed price contract for the design/build of the FY 2002 Training Area Access Road (Fusa Road) at Fort Drum, Lewis County, Ne w York. The design-build process is the procurement of a facility utilizing a Request of Proposal (RFP) to solicit both the design and construction of the facility by a single contractual instrument. The project includes two bridges (crossing greater than 20 meters):  numerous culverts, cut and fill operations, rock ripping and blasting, signage, guard rail, wetlands avoidance and mitigation, storm water drainage, and site restoration associated with the construction proposed to upgrade Fusa Road.  This pro curement is unrestricted and shall be open to all bidders.  The NAICS code for this effort is 234110(1997 Code)/237310(2002 Code).  The size standard is $28.5 million.  The process for this award shall be in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.1 - Source Select ion Processes and Techniques, utilizing the Tradeoff Process, pursuant to FAR 15.101-1. When using a tradeoff process, the following apply: (1) All evaluation factors and significant subfactors that will affect contract award and their relative importance shall be clearly stated in the solicitation; and (2) The solicitation shall state whether all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than, approximately equal to, or significantly less important than co st or price. This solicitation is not a competitive open bid and there will not be a formal public bid opening. The U. S. Government reserves the right to limit the competitive range to up to five of the highest rated technical proposals.  Initial proposal s should contain the Offerors best concept and innovative approach from a technical and pricing viewpoint.  Offerors must meet all solicitation requirements.  The Government has left the final solution for the foundations, structural and electrical to the  designer. The Government is seeking any innovative ideas to achieve the design-build objectives within the limits of the solicitation. The offerors may use construction techniques, methods, or systems, which they feel, are the best approach for designing and building the road and the structures.  Evaluation factors for this effort shall include: Factor 1  Recent Experience in Design and Construction; Factor 2  Proposed Engineering Systems; Factor 3  Past Performance, Design and Construction; Factor 4 - Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Sub-Contracting Efforts Factor 5 - Contractors submission matching/organized as outline in RFP; Factor 6- Price/Cost Proposal. The proposals will be evaluated upon the analysis of the technical qualification s and Price. The evaluation process essentially consists of four parts: proposal compliance review, technical/quality evaluation, final proposal revision (if necessary), and price evaluation. To be considered acceptable, Offerors shall specifically address  each of the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation. Sufficient detail should be provided citing specific data as may be required, such that the proposal may be adequately evaluated. The proposal must clearly show that the Offeror has an understa nding of the work required and has the capability to accomplish the project in accordance with the project schedule.

Berms left overnight or over weekends, due to weather or breakdown, shall be posted as a hazard and visibly illuminated at night in accordance with the, Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Pollution and Erosion Control. During all operations under this contract, the Contractor shall exercise reasonable measures to direct surface runoff water to stabilized waterways and to keep the drainage systems functioning effectively to prevent or minimize soil erosion and pollution of water and other resources. All refuse, including garbage, rubbish, and solid or liquid wastes from the Contractor's operations, including camps, parking areas, and equipment maintenance areas shall be stored and collected in a sanitary manner and disposed of in a State approved sanitary landfill. Soil removed from the culverts shall be placed on or alongside the road, as directed by the COR. Prosecution of Work. The Contractor's blading operations shall not continue when moisture conditions are not favorable for obtaining a satisfactory result. Suitable moisture conditions are determined to be in excess of five (5) percent and less than fifteen (15) percent unless otherwise authorized by the COR. When suitable moisture conditions exist, the Contractor shall proceed with blading and shaping within five days of notification by the COR. Failure of the Contractor to resume work within the specified time could subject the Contractor's right to proceed to immediate termination. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS Description - Road blading shall consist of the blading and shaping of the roadbed, including shoulders and turnouts, cleaning and shaping the drainage ditches, grade dips and water bars, to restore and maintain the original cross section and grade of the road, and includes removing ruts, washes, slough and other irregularities that prevent normal runoff from the road surface. The hydro-vac unit shall remove silt and washed-in material from culvert catch basins back to their original grade line. Material in the culverts shall be removed from their entire length, and the outlet shall be free flowing. This cleaning shall be accomplished with the structures, in place. The Contractor shall not be allowed to wash or flush this material thru the culvert and onto the ground. Material removed from the culverts and catch basins will be captured and placed as directed by the COR. Methods - Blading A. Blading and shaping operations shall be performed in such a manner as to conserve existing materials. Blading of aggregate surfaced portions of the road shall be performed in such a manner that the base is not disturbed and no surface material is lost either in ditches or over the road shoulders. Blading on unsurfaced roads shall be performed in such a manner that no base material is lost. B. All ruts, chuckholes, and washes shall be removed by cutting to the bottom of such defects to provide for uniform compaction of roadbed material. High blading, which is merely filling the depressions with loose material, will not be acceptable. C. Settlement sections shall be repaired insofar as practicable by cutting from the roadbed on each end of the settled area and filling into the settled area to provide smooth transitions to adjacent road grades. D. Blading and shaping operations shall not undercut road backslopes. E. Surface material shall be bladed from one edge of the road to the other in a berm in order to eliminate any segregation prior to spreading. Sections having segregated materials after spreading shall be reprocessed and spread. F. On road sections constructed with a roadside ditch, the roadbed blading and shaping operations shall be performed so as to maintain crown at the centerline of the roadbed, except on curves where crown is omitted. Road cross section shall slope uniformly both ways from the crown apex to the shoulders at a minimum grade of two percent and a maximum grade of six percent. G. Road sections constructed without a roadside ditch shall be uniformly outsloped the entire width of the roadbed. The slope grade shall be a minimum of two percent and a maximum of five percent. Roads shall not be insloped unless approved in writing by the Contracting Officer. H. Existing drainage dips shall be cleaned and the outslope grade restored to equal or exceed the gradient of the road. I. On aggregate surfaced sections of the road, slough may be bladed across the road, provided it is not deposited in chuckholes, washes or ruts in the road surface. Such material shall be sidecast on stable fill slopes or natural ground out of streams, streambeds or other waterways. Care must be exercised so as not to contaminate the aggregate surface. J. Loose material located along the outside shoulder and along the ditch line of the road shall be salvaged and incorporated into the roadbed by windrowing on the road prior to shaping. The ditches shall be pulled and the material incorporated into the roadbed. Oversized material shall be feathered to the outside shoulder of the road so that there will be no berm or ridge in the completed road section. K. Widened roadway sections at curves, fills, and turnouts shall also be included with the blading of the roadway. The shoulder line shall be definite, continuous, and smooth, with no abrupt changes in alignment. Blading shall be done in such a manner to neither widen nor narrow the existing roadway. L. Existing aggregate surfacing material shall be bladed so as to conserve suitable surface material. Blading shall not be performed unless sufficient moisture is present to prevent segregation or enable compaction and/or blading shall not be performed when excess moisture prevents proper blending and compaction, as determined by the Contracting Officer and/or COR. M. Wood, rocks, and other debris shall be removed from roadside drainage ditches to provide unobstructed flow of water. The back slope of the ditch shall not be undercut by ditch cleaning operations. The slope to the road shoulder shall be maintained at an approximate ratio of 3:1 from the bottom of the ditch to the edge of the roadbed. Typical depth of roadside drainage ditches is one foot below roadbed. Existing ditch blocks shall be retained and reshaped as needed. N. Rocks or other material remaining on the roadway surface after the final blading that fail to pass through a 3 inch sieve shall be removed (by hand if necessary) and side cast on the downhill road slope or disposed of as otherwise agreed. O. Cattleguards shall be left clean. No additional material may be deposited in the cattleguard. P. At the conclusion of the blading and shaping operations, the roadbed shall be smoothed and dressed up to produce a uniform grade and cross section, and a surface free of hollows, depressions and projections above the adjacent roadbed surface. No berm or ridge of any material shall be left along either shoulder of the roadbed unless directed by the Contracting Officer's Representative.

OIEA also desires to provide investors with interactive calculators that help investors assess the added costs of trading on margin and the risks of receiving a margin call.  In particular, OIEA wants to provide a ?risk of margin call? calculator that will estimate an investor?s chances of receiving a margin call based on current pricing trends for the actual securities the investor owns or plans to purchase on margin.  Rather than making projections based on a hypothetical portfolio or estimated prices, the calculator will use real-world data to gauge the investor?s risk. OIEA desires to enter into an agreement to license an existing software product with a base year plus 4 option years.

<CONTACT>Charlotte Hunter, Contract Specialist, Phone (703)681-0923, Fax (703)681-1211, Email hunterc@ncr.disa.mil
<DESC>This action was originally published 28 May 2002 as Solicitation Number NAICS511210. All technical questions regarding this RFI should be directed to the Technical Point of Contact (POC):  Ginny Parsons, Email:parson1g@ncr.disa.mil.  Responses are due no later than 3:00 PM, EDT, 28 June 2002. Responses received after this date may be evaluated at the Government's discretion as time permits.  As a result of vendor questions and to further clarify the Government's requirement, the following additional information is provided.  Question:  You want a broker to go across multiple databases.  Is there any concern about the security of this type of operation?  Answer:  The broker will need to go across multiple sources (both structured and unstructured data).  Security is indeed a concern (e.g., access control, transmission encryption).  Question:  Please provide projections as to project size/scope.  How much data is the search component of your RFI needing to index?  How large is the source pool of data?  How many pages/documents overall would you estimate we need to serve?  What is the estimated number of searches per day?  Answer:  The potential scale of the system may be a user community in the tens of thousands.  There exist a variety of product collections with each collection containing hundreds of thousands of discreet products.  These collections of documents will have a variable spoilage rate both between and within a single product collection.  Number of searches per day will be variant.  Estimates based on a user and product constrained implementation in place set a 30 query per second peak usage.  Question:  What does DISA want to do with schema modification?  If you modify the underlying schema of a product, it is no longer a COTS application and could cause a large increase in on-going maintenance.  Answer:  DISA would prefer the ability to modify and extend the schema used to tag information products so that the system may be customized to the needs of the user community.  Question:  If DISA moves forward with this project, what time frame is the RFP anticipated?  Answer:  Unable to provide a timeframe at this time.  Question:  Is the general view that DISA is looking for a BIZ Talk platform with an application on top of Biz Talk?  Answer:  The scope of this research is unrestricted, and DISA has not committed to an application platform.  Question:  How can we obtain copies of the following documents, referenced in the RFI:  Global Information Grid (GIG) Capstone Requirements Document (CRD, Information Dissemination Management (IDM) CRD, Joint Vision 2020?  Answer:  GIG CRD: http://www.dsc.osd.mil/gig/GIG_Arch_v.1.0_(Final)/GIG_CRD_(Final).pdf; IDM CRD:  The GIG CRD now encompasses everything originally found in the IDM CRD.  Joint Vision 2020:  www.dtic.mil  Question:  Request for more information about the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet).  Answer:  The SIPRNet is a government-owned TCP-IP network, similar to the Internet.  Question:  Can we have access to the [table of specific requirements the product must target] mentioned [in the RFI Description section]?  It was not located on the FedBizOpps site with the RFI Synopsis.  Answer:  The information originally formatted in a table is provided in the "Description" section of the RFI under "Items of Consideration", and is enumerated 1-20.  Question:  Can we have clarification on the requirements listed as [they] relate to a search engine?  (Reference:  the capabilities identified for the IDM Metadata Search Engine in accordance with DOD enterprise service requirements).  Answer:  The requirements are a reflection of the complexity of the IDM project effort.  Some of the requirements extend the classic definition of a search engine toward the information management goal of IDM.  Identify how your search application and/or other corporate products meet the need expressed.  Where multiple products are identified, describe the interface between the products and how/if they fuse to provide a greater capability.  Question:  What is meant by the following terms:  1.  Brokered Requests.  Search requests processed by other instances of a search engine or other search engines on the network.  2.  Metadata Catalogs is a catalog of links to information products.  3.  Source Attribution.  With each returned search item, append a notation of the owner of the referenced information product.  Question:  (reference:  "Items of Consideration", #10)  "The product shall serve as an information source to other search products."  What do "other search products" mean?  Answer:  In addition to the search capability requested, other search capabilities will exist on the network.  These will exist in the form of COTS products as well as interfaces to COTS products.  Question:  (reference:  "Items of Consideration", #11)  "The product shall operate in the DII COE operational environment secured for use in the classified environment."  What is meant by "DII COE...classified environment."?  Answer:  Instead, describe the capabilities of your product to include industry standard security mechanisms.  Question:  (reference:  "Items of Consideration", #14)  "The product shall provide the ability to use external directory services for authentication."  What directory services are being used?  Answer:  Various directory services may be used.  Please enumerate your capabilities.  Question:  (reference:  "Items of Consideration", #16)  "The product shall allow the import and modification of the schema used to characterize the information products."  Please clarify "import and modification of the schema".  Answer:  The schema used to describe the information products must be open to extension and modification.  Question:  (reference:  "Items of Consideration", #17)  "The product shall allow policy based operations constrained by user, resource, and access."  Please clarify "policy based operations".  Answer:  Prefer to leave this term open to interpretation by the responders.  Question:  Please clarify the various criteria that will be used to evaluate the Metadata Search Engine products for implementation of IDM enterprise services.  Answer:  No clarification will be given identifying the rating systems or scale used to assess these areas.  Question:  May we demonstrate our capabilities?  The purpose of the RFI is to perform market research in obtaining information technology capabilities via contractor written capabilities summaries.  Upon review of capability summaries submitted, the government may request those firms, whose capabilities are deemed most applicable to the requirements identified to provide a demonstration of their capabilities.  Due to the anticipated high volume of response, the Government reserves the right to invite selected contractors to provide a demonstration.  The Government is under no obligation to allow all contractors an opportunity for a demonstration.  For those companies invited, it is the Government's intent to limit the time for each demonstration to approximately forty (40) minutes for the actual demonstration and another twenty (20) minutes for a question and answer session. All other information publicized in the original RFI remains the same.

Proposal Submission Place:  Mr. Cui Guanglei, Director & Vice President, China Petrochemical International Co., Ltd. Building C, Anli Garden, No. 66 Anli St., Chaoyang District, Beijing 100101, CHINA Phone:  86-10-6490-7877, Fax: 86-10-6421-6972  :  

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study that would define the technical and financial requirements of an e-procurement system for Sinopec International, China?s leading trading company. The two goals of the feasibility study would be to determine (a) how Sinopec International should invest, organize its business, and train its staff to implement the e-procurement system and (b) what type of e-procurement system the firm should implement.  

Sinopec International is responsible for import and export activities related to Sinopec, its parent company, and handles the largest trade volume of any Chinese entity ($12.2 billion in 2000, reflecting $11 billion in imports and $1.2 billion in exports). With China?s accession into the WTO and the implementation of China?s 10th Five-Year Plan (2001-2005), demand for crude oil and petrochemical products now outpaces domestic supply.  Consequently, China will likely have to follow measures to conserve oil, find fuel substitutes, accelerate exploration and exploitation of oil and natural gas resources, and make effective use of overseas resources.

Given these circumstances, Sinopec International plans to acquire as much technology as possible through technical exchanges with their foreign counterparts, as well as accelerate procurement of conventional equipment and services for the petroleum and petrochemical industry, heavy vehicles for transportation, telecommunications infrastructure, iron & steel piping, instrumentation, chemical products and advanced gas sales systems.  To facilitate its procurement activities, Sinopec International plans to establish its own e-procurement platform.

The tasks that would be completed for the feasibility study by the U.S. firm include: (1) Recommendation for a Strategic Investment and Management Plan; (2) Recommendation for Technical Implementation; (3) Strategic Investment Plan for Sinopec International?s E-Procurement System; (4) Technical Specifications Plan for Sinopec International?s E-Procurement System; (5) Organizational Staff Development and Training Needs and Plans; (6) Legal Concerns for E-Procurement Systems; (7) Cultural Concerns for E-Procurement Systems; and (8) Financial Plan.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $429,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, August 5, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>INDEFINITE DELIVERY, INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) MULTIPLE AWARD TASK ORDER CONTRACT FOR CONSTRUCTION - SOLICITATION GS06P02GYD0014 DUE 7/23/02. POC/Contract Specialist, CLAUDINE DALTON (816)823-2271, CONTRACTING OFFICER, PEGGY JEWETT (816)823-2266. REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL NOTICE FOR IDIQ Contract for Construction in the State of Nebraska and the Cities of Sioux City and Council Bluffs in the State of Iowa, Project RNE22125. NOTE: Offerors are required to have an established office within the (SMSA)or within Cass County, Nebraska, PRIOR to issuance of the Request for Technical Proposals. (SMSA consists of Pottawattamie County in Iowa, Douglas, Sarpy or Lancaster Counties in Nebraska). Request for Technical Proposals (Phase I) will issue on or about 6/20/2002 with a closing date of 7/23/2002.  

Request for Price Proposals (Phase II) will issue on or about 8/28/2002 with a closing date on or about 10/01/2002. Time for completion approximately 365 calendar days. Anticipated maximum ordering limitation per year: $2,000,000. Guaranteed Annual Minimum: $200.00. Estimated cost range per task order: $2,000.00 - $2,000,000.00. A typical task order could contain some or all of the following: modifications to architectural components including, but not limited to: ceilings, walls, floors (including access floor systems), roofing systems, millwork, and wall covering. Work may also include modifications and replacement of mechanical systems to include, but not be limited to: air handling units, chillers, boilers, ductwork systems and accessories, piping systems (including pumps), HVAC system controls, fire protection sprinkler systems and accessories, and plumbing equipment/accessories. Work may also include electrical systems to include, but not be limited to: lighting systems, primary and secondary power distribution systems and transformers. Special competencies will be required for any work involving membrane roofing, asbestos abatement, PCB removal and/or elevator work. The Government will award up to 10 (ten) IDIQ contracts under this solicitation. Each award will be for one year. There will also be four additional one-year options. The award of a firm-fixed price task order will result from Phase II of this solicitation. It is anticipated that future projects will be awarded on a task order basis to the one contractor (of the awardees) who offers the lowest lump sum price. This is a competitive negotiated acquisition. Proposals will be evaluated using a Two-Phase process. Phase I will be technical evaluations, Phase II will be pricing. The Government intends to use the "greatest value concept" in making the selections. The "greatest value concept" is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors. Phase I, the Request for Technical Proposals (RFTP), contains Construction Contract Clauses, Labor Standards, Solicitation Provisions, Proposal Submittal Requirements and Evaluation Factors. This RFTP will issue on or about 6/20/2002.  All requests for the RFTP must be in writing. There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference on 07/02/2002. Proposals are due on 7/23/2002. Specific address is specified in the RFTP. Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted. The Government may proceed to Phase II without discussion. However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected to participate in Phase II and may discuss proposals with the offerors. The Government will evaluate Phase I submissions to establish those within a "competitive range". A "short-list" of technically qualified contractors will be published in Fed Biz Opps on or about 8/23/2002. Only those firms within the competitive range will be invited by the Government to provide Phase II submissions, consisting of pricing and any special requirements defined in the specifications. Two factors will be considered: a technical evaluation factor and price. The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are: (1) Construction Experience and Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualification of Key Personnel, and (3) Management and Special Capabilities. The price factor is not as important as the technical evaluation factors. As proposals become more equal in technical merit, price becomes more important. Phase II, specifications (bidding documents) will be available from the General Services Administration at no cost. Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, Rick Etem, at (816)823-2261. NOTE: OFFERORS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE AN ESTABLISHED OFFICE WITHIN THE OMAHA or LINCOLN NEBRASKA SMSA (THE SMSA AREA CONSISTS OF POTTAWATTAMIE COUNTY IN IOWA, DOUGLAS, SARPY OR LANCASTER COUNTIES IN NEBRASKA)OR IN CASS COUNTY, NEBRASKA, PRIOR TO ISSUANCE OF THE REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.  AN ESTABLISHED OFFICE IS DEFINED AS AN ESTABLISHED BASE OF OPERATIONS FOR TWO OR MORE PERMANENT PERSONNEL FROM WHICH PREVIOUS CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED and/or PERFORMED.  REQUESTS FOR SPECIFICATIONS SHOULD BE FAXED TO CLAUDINE DALTON AT  (816)823-2273. REQUESTS SHALL BE ON COMPANY LETTERHEAD WITH COMPANY NAME, ADDRESS, TELEPHONE NUMBER AND FAX NUMBER.  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION MUST BE INCLUDED WITH REQUEST IN ORDER FOR REQUEST TO BE HONORED: COPY OF A VALID BUSINESS LICENSE OR OTHER DOCUMENTATION GRANTED BY THE STATE OR LOCAL JURISDICTION TO CONDUCT BUSINESS, COMPANY DUNS NUMBER, AND A VALID IRS TAX ID NUMBER.

For further information, please contact Carla Echols (206) 526-6370.  NAICS Code is 562219 with a small business size standard of 11.5 million.This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  The  Solicitation Notice is No. AB1330-02-RP-0084R.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 97-25.   The Auke Bay Laboratory (ABL), one of four divisions of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), was first occupied December 5, 1960.  The facility is located on the main road, approximately 12 miles north of downtown Juneau, in southeast Alaska.  It is on the eastern shore of Auke Bay, which supports a rich marine environment.  The ABL workforce consists of 70 permanent employees and 15-25 contractors and non-NOAA personnel; the annual operating budget is nearly $10 million.  Present research involves six programs plus ABL administrative management.  Statement of Problem: During the course of previous asbestos surveys and interim abatement projects, asbestos containing materials (ACM) in the buildings of the Auke Bay Laboratory have been identified.  Recent renovation work in the genetics laboratory and the former dark room also identified potentially friable ACM on the pipe joints in the interstitial spaces above the laboratory.  This source of ACM had not been identified during previous assessments.  ACM associated with certain floor tiles, cove base and mastic had been identified during previous assessments,  approximately 4,400 square feet of floor tiles and approximately 60 pipe joints in the Main building and the Butler building. The condition of the floor tiles and mastic within the laboratory buildings has deteriorated over time.  A new project to update the survey, update air monitoring results, establish abatement priorities and monitor the abatement process is required.    A copy of the previous survey is available upon request.   Description of Work: The work will consist of a formal survey, analysis and testing to determine the location and condition of ACM.  This survey will update the previous survey completed in September, 1995.   The contractor shall perform a comprehensive asbestos survey of the Main and Butler buildings of the Auke Bay Laboratory to verify the location and condition of the known ACM within the buildings and to identify any unknown ACM.  Previous survey results and the results of previous abatement projects shall be made available to the contractor prior to commencing work.  Results from the new survey will be used to establish priorities for continuing abatement of ACM from the buildings.  Priorities for removal of the ACM from specific work areas shall be established by the AFSC Safety and Environmental Compliance Officer and the ABL Director, in coordination with the contractor.   The contractor shall also help design an abatement work plan that is safe, effective and minimizes the disruption and dislocation to laboratory personnel.  The contractor shall investigate the condition of the plumbing pipe insulation and floor tiles to determine the best course of action for safe removal or encapsulation.  This investigation shall include accurately diagraming the location of affected pipe joints, analytical testing of potential ACM and preparation of a work plan for the safe and appropriate abatement techniques to be used by the abatement contractor.  It is estimated that approximately 20 samples will be required for laboratory analysis, from an accredited laboratory.  The contractor shall also coordinate with the abatement contractor to ensure that all asbestos work is performed in a safe, efficient and compliant manner.  Class I, Class II, Class III and Class IV asbestos work, if any, shall only be performed by employees of the contractor trained and certified in accordance with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1926.1101).  The contractor shall provide NOAA copies of its employees current training certifications prior to commencing work.  If required, the contractor shall provide all required personnel protective equipment to its employees.  Employees who are required to work in "regulated areas" must also be provided with clean rooms, shower rooms and other facilities as required by the OSHA standards.  The methods of work shall be so designed as to prevent any contractor or government employee's exposure in excess of 0.1 fibers per cubic centimeter of Air Monitoring:  The contractor shall provide all labor and materials to monitor asbestos fibers in the buildings air prior to the start of any ACM abatement work.  The contractor shall be available on an hourly basis for consultation services periodically during the course of the abatement work and upon completion of abatement work.  The contractor shall assume sole and complete responsibility for the entire job site during the course of its work, including the safety of all persons and property.  A report of the complete monitoring results shall be turned over to the Auke Bay Laboratory Director.  Period of Performance:  Due to the ongoing safety and environmental concerns caused be the presence of deteriorating asbestos containing materials in the workplace, time is of the essence in completing the project.  In addition, the construction season in Alaska is limited due to severe winter weather conditions.  Therefore, the Contractor shall be required to a.) Commence work under the contract within 7 calendar days after the Contractor receives the notice to proceed, b.) Prosecute the work diligently, and c.) Complete the entire work plan, ready for use, not later than thirty days after receipt of the notice to proceed.  Deliverables:  Upon completion of the project, the contractor shall provide to the Auke Bay Laboratory Director, in electronic format: (1) A comprehensive report of the tasks performed, (2) The contractor's prioritized recommendations for abatement activities, (3) All analytical test results, (4) Annotated drawings showing the location and condition of ACM in the Main building and the Butler building. (5) All air monitoring test results, and (6) A recommended work plan for conducting the abatement activities.  Technical evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance with Factors B and C  being equal.   Factor A:  Demonstrate successful past performance experience on similar asbestos surveys and consultation projects.

<RESPDATE>070802
<ARCHDATE>01082003
<CONTACT>Capt. Ron King, ESC/SRK, 781-377-8966
<DESC>Ref Sources Sought Synopsis, same subject, dated 12 June 2002.  The purpose of this re-synopsis is to provide additional descriptive information about ARGUS, to solicit qualification packages from interested contractors, and to announce an ARGUS industry day: This is a sources sought synopsis for Market Research purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a request for proposal or award a contract as a result of this request. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. The Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Integration Systems Program Office, ESC, Hanscom AFB, MA, is seeking responsible contractors to design, develop, integrate, produce, test, and field Advanced Remote Ground Unattended Sensors (ARGUS).   ARGUS will be the next-generation family of unattended sensors that will initially include a seismic and acoustic sensor suite and a communications package, all housed in an aerodynamic delivery body.  The aerobody will require an open architecture design for ease of future sensor and aircraft integration.  Hand-in-place configurations, remote-monitoring stations, communications interfaces, mission planning tools, and pre-deployment checkout equipment will also be required. ARGUS will be integrated into the USAF intelligence and communications architectures, and will be included in pre-deployment mission planning.  The ARGUS concept is to enhance Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (IPB), and the utility of other ISR assets such a Joint STARS, U-2, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), etc.   An overlay to a mission-planning tool, such as Geographic Area Limitation Environment (GALE), will be used for employment.  ARGUS will be pre-operationally tested and certified on the following baseline airframes: F-15E, F-16, and Predator UAV and possibly the F-18. Long-term certifications are planned for multiple delivery aircraft, including but not limited to the Joint Strike Fighter and possibly AV-8.  Once employed, the sensors will communicate to a workstation fully integrated into the Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) and Multi-Mission Command and Control Aircraft (MC2A).  The sensor will transmit messages via a military or commercial satellite communications system, formatted into a standard Tactical Information Broadcast Service (TIBS) and/or Tactical Receive Equipment (TRE) and related Applications (TRAP) message(s), and broadcast through the USAF Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS). Permits dissemination of timely intelligence on time critical targets to tactical users, provides threat avoidance, targeting, target tracking, and target/situation awareness within existing and planned CAOC C2 and ISR workstations. Comply with Department of Defense (DoD), Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), Congressional Mandates, and Joint Technical Architecture (JTA) requirements and adheres to National Policy as it relates to the provision of data on broadcasts to Coalition Partners.   The physical location will be independent of the function.  Open systems architecture will accommodate new system interfaces and upgrades.  Modularity will accommodate two critical features: spiral development and integration of additional sensor and communications packages throughout the life of the system, and the 2-Level Maintenance concept (i.e. sensor & component "swap-out" capability at the field level). Permits users to obtain additional amplifying information, producer-to-producer interaction, and allows for cost-effective expansion to networked sensor capability. ARGUS will utilize common track/report/event numbers and provides an efficient means for producer to update previously reported tracks/reports/events (preferably automated) and support several levels of secure data simultaneously and accreditation for processing said data. The Government requests interested contractors submit a qualification package, not to exceed ten (10) one-sided pages, not including supporting graphical illustrations, to ESC/SRK, Attn Capt. Ron King 29 Randolph Road, Bldg 1102C, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-3010.  UPS, Fed Ex, or other carrier shipments should be addressed to: ESC/SRK, Attn Capt. Ron King, 11 Barksdale St., Bldg 1614, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731 not later than 15 days after release of this synopsis.  The capability packages should indicate the source's intent to be either a prime contractor or subcontractor. Sources interested in being only a subcontractor should briefly identify relevant experience and expertise only in a two (2) page response.  An additional one (1) page of questions to the Government may be included under separate cover for all submissions.  Sources are also requested to identify any on-going Government contract vehicles they may have for the same or similar work.  Please include the name and number of the on-going contract, contract scope, contract type, period of performance, contract deliverables, dollar thresholds and limitations, the issuing Government agency, and the name and telephone number of the Contracting Officer. Interested contractors should also identify if they qualify as a large, business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business or service-disabled veteran-owned small business and whether they are an U.S. or foreign-owned firm. The Government will evaluate each capability package submitted to determine whether they are considered "highly competitive" or "not highly competitive" and will notify each source, in writing, of the Government's determination and its rationale.  Capability packages should address their sources' qualifications with respect to the key ARGUS features discussed above and the following six (6) screening criteria: (a) Personnel, facilities and storage with SECRET clearances (b) Past experience in designing and building hardware and software for sensors (c) Past experience in integrating Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware and software (d) Specific expertise in / knowledge of existing unattended sensor technology (e) Specific expertise in / knowledge in communications, dissemination, and DoD systems and (f) Knowledge of DoD architecture, activities and standards.  Interested offerors who respond with their intention to be a prime contractor will be evaluated against the above screening criteria. Those not meeting the screening criteria will be invited to discuss with the Government their ability to meet the requirements of a prime contractor.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a request for bid or proposals, nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for information provided in response to this synopsis. Also for your information, an ARGUS Industry Day is planned for 30 July 2002 from 0830 - 1200 hours, and will be held at the MITRE Corporation, 202 Burlington Rd., Bedford, MA, in Room 1S-100. Demonstrations of technology or existing systems by government or industry will not be conducted as part of this industry day.  The ARGUS Program Office will entertain requests for one-on-one discussions with those contractors interested in being a Prime Contractor during the afternoon of 30 July 2002 and on 31 July 2002.  Discussions will be limited to 40-minute sessions.  The POC for Registration for the Industry Day and one-on-one meetings is Mr. Chris Haftel, (781) 377-9448, Chris.Haftel@hanscom.af.mil.  Directions can be accessed at http://www.mitre.org.   Please limit attendees to three (3) personnel per respondent. The Hanscom Electronic RF Bulletin Board (HERBB) will be the primary source of information for this acquisition.  Interested parties should call 781-271-0500 or subscribe online at http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil. Industry comments and questions shall be directed to ESC/SRK, Capt Ron King, (781) 377- 8966, Ronald.King@hanscom.af.mil. An Acquisition Ombudsman, Colonel Joseph P. Maryeski, Director, Commander's Staff, has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during proposal development. You should only contact the Ombudsman with issues or problems you cannot satisfactorily resolve with the program manager and/or contracting officer.  The Ombudsman role is to hear concerns, issues, and recommendations and communicate these to the appropriate government personnel. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality if desired. The Ombudsman does not evaluate proposals or participate in source selection. You can contact the Ombudsman at (781) 377-5106. See Note 26.

<SUBJECT>R -- Security Certification and Accreditation for Application Information Systems
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) intends to extend Contract No. 50-PBPT-8-00005 with Northrop Grumman Information Technology (NGIT) from December 1, 2002 to March 31, 2003 for services to support the Certification and Accreditation (C&A) for the security of its Application Information Systems (AISs), in accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III, which interprets the Government Information Security Reform Act (GISRA), and contained in the USPTO's 21st Century Strategic Plan dated June 3, 2002.  The USPTO requires NGIT's contract be extended to continue its task order support of the C&A of USPTO's critical systems.  NGIT is currently piloting the vulnerability assessment required for C&A program.  The vulnerability assessment pilot will not be completed prior to November 30, 2002, the expiration date of NGIT's current contract.  The USPTO is in the process of awarding a follow-on contract for Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) services; however, a transition of the C&A cannot begin until the pilot is completed.  The follow-on SETA contractor will perform all other SETA services required by the USPTO.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  At this time, NGIT is deemed the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements for the extension period for the continued support of the C&A for the security of its AISs.  Any award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  Concerns which believe that they have the ability to furnish the specified support are requested to give written notification to:  U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Office of Procurement, Attn:  Sylvia Van Dyke, Contracting Officer, Box 6, Washington, DC 20231.  This is NOT a formal solicitation and a formal solicitation will not be issued.  The Point of Contact is:  Sylvia Van Dyke, E-mail:  Sylvia.VanDyke@uspto.gov., Ph: 703-305-4165, Fax: 703-308-5484.

<SUBJECT>C -- A/E Services for the New U. S. Courthouse in Nashville, TN
<DESC>Coorection--This title should read A/E Services for the New U. S. Courthouse in Nashville, Tennessee (not CMc Services for the New U. S. Courthouse in Nashville, Tennessee).

A-E Services for the New U. S. Courthouse, Nashville, Tennessee GS-04P-02-EXC-0038. Additional Questions and Answers: Q. Is it GSA's preference that the response to question #1, address the work of the Lead Designer's firm, rather than the "A/E firm" who will be the architect of record? A. The "A/E firm" can be just the Lead Designer's firm or if the Lead Designer is associating in some way with a production firm or local firm the team can be considered the "A/E firm." The Lead Designer is not required to associate with another firm in Stage 1 (or ever, as long as the designer's firm meets the geographic restrictions). Thus, projects presented by the "A/E firm" can be from the Lead Design firm, an associate firm or both. Q. Should the A/E firm with whom the Lead Designer's firm intends to teen be included in the 255, or should the 255 list only the Lead Designer's firm? A. If the Lead Designer associates with another firm in Stage I, the 255 should reflect both firms and 254's should be submitted for both firms. Again, the design firm is NOT required to team with any other firm in Stage I, but may if they choose. Q. For the 255, in block 6 (list the sub-consultants and whether you've worked with them in the past), should the Lead Designer identify the proposed sub-consultant team, or leave this blank? A. Identification of consultants or sub-consultants is not required in Stage 1. Q. In meeting the GSA subcontracting goals: SBE 40%, MBE 8%, WBE 5%, Service Disabled Veteran Owned 2.5%, Hubzone Small Business 2.5%, and DBE 2.5%, are we allowed to use a firm that meets one goal to also go toward another?for example, an MBE that is also an SBE? A. Only in the case of a Hubzone small business. For example, if you are a woman-owned small business and a Hubzone small business, then you could meet the goal in both areas. Q. What is the status of the historic assessment of the parking garage on the Church Street site 12; is there an underground tank and utilities on this site; and is this site still under consideration? A. We are still conducting the environmental and historical evaluations. There are utility lines running through the alleys on this site. Site 12 is still under consideration. Q. Do the projects included in the past performance on the design and the Lead Designer's portfolio sections have to be completed through construction? A. They do not have to be completed through construction but greater weightier will be given to those that are substantially complete compared to those that are not substantially complete. Q. Do we have to include the entire 255 sections in addition to the information asked in the evaluation criteria, including the resumes? Should we answer an entire question 10 on the 255 in addition to the evaluation criteria? A. No resumes are required in Stage 1, except the information represented in the Lead Designer's credentials. Firms may present projects as part of the 255 in addition to the ones they want considered for the firm's and the Lead Designer's projects, but it is certainly not required. Q. Given the nature of the site and the fact that the project involves urban planning, can we show planning projects that entail urban/security aspects? A. The selection of projects is at your discretion. Q. Who is the Peer Advisor for this proposal? A. We don't release that information. Q. Is this project in the state of conceptual drawings that will be used to determine the CMc and then be bid for the various? A. No, we are not in the conceptual drawings stage. We are in the process of selecting an Architect/Engineering firm.
