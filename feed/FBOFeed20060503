<DESC>General Information Document Type: BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) Classification Code: A -- Research & Development Description AJ61 - Broad Area Announcement for an advanced Lightweight Tactical All Terrain Vehicle (LTATV). 

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as represented in FAR 6.102(d)(2). The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is soliciting proposals for advanced capabilities for a Lightweight Tactical All Terrain Vehicle (LTATV). These systems enhance SOF mission performance by providing a family of mobility platforms to meet both tactical and logistical function needs.    The LTATV utility variant can be used to evacuate casualties, transport equipment, and haul supplies within the unit’s operational area.  The addition of commercially available track conversion system or other technologies may be considered to enhance around-the-clock, all weather use in cold climates and otherwise un-navigable terrain.

The USSOCOM has an interest for the research and development of a family of mobility platforms to meet tactical and logistical functions.  It is the intent of this announcement to maximize, to the greatest extent possible, technology that can be readily adapted to meet the objectives described in this BAA.   LTATVs must be designed to operate worldwide on primary and secondary roads and unimproved off-road terrain as well as mountainous terrain.  System requirements include operation in around-the-clock, worldwide use in all ranges of weather and terrain.  

The following specific aspects of the LTATV are of interest: 1) Advanced human factors consideration which enhance both safety and operational capabilities in tactical and administrative environments, including effective use of weapons and communications equipment while operating the vehicle, 2)  Optimized power plant capability with consideration of multi-fuel/hybrid electric, 3) Transportable via all current and envisioned Special Operations Forces (SOF) fixed and rotary wing cargo aircraft, including the CV-22, 4) Night vision device compatible, 5) Improved safety features such as roll-over protection, 6) Capable of supporting worldwide deployment in all terrains and climates, 7) Single and multiple-passenger variants as part of the proposed family of vehicles will be considered appropriate.

This BAA shall remain open for 30 days from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov. The Government anticipates hosting an Industry Day during May 2006.  Offeror’s interested in attending Industry Day should provide their Company Name, address, phone number and point of contact information to contract specialist, Ms. Allison Hutchens, at the following  e-mail address: hutchea@socom.mil.  Date, time and location of the Industry Day will be provided to responders to this BAA via separate correspondence.  The intent of the Industry Day is to provide the opportunity for the Government to exchange information with industry on USSOCOM’s LTATV needs and requirements and will include both open-forum and closed-door opportunities.
 
Interested parties shall provide a white paper NLT 30 days after the Industry Day.  White papers should not exceed fifteen pages of text and should describe the following:  1)  Offeror’s proposed LTATV solution and integration objective, to include discussion of vehicle size, weight, payload capability, speed, performance, sustainment support requirements, and general characteristics, 2) Proposed development approach to meet the SOF requirements, 3) Related work by the Offeror, 4) Anticipated contributions to USSOCOM programs, 5) An estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for an RDT&E effort intended not to exceed 6 months.  White papers should address any or all of the vehicle aspects noted above.  White papers will be selected for further proposal submission based on a subjective determination.  Requests for proposals (RFP) will be issued on an individual basis with responses due within 30 days.  Not all Offeror’s that provide white papers will be invited to submit a proposal.  An invitation does not assure an Offeror of a subsequent contract award.  Offerors should anticipate demonstrating the capabilities of their prototypes at a time and location to be determined by the Government.  

The selection of proposals for award will be based on a subjective determination of the proposal’s 1) Practical application and operational technical merits of the proposed development, 2) Qualifications and experience of the principal investigator(s), and availability of facilities to support and conduct the development and integration, 3) Realism of the proposed costs, and 4) Performance potential of the vehicles.  Selection of proposals for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, with respect to the availability of funds.  Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation.  

White papers and subsequent proposals must identify any rights and restrictions that exist on the offeror’s technical data.  All Offeror’s are advised that restrictions on technology transfers outside of the U.S. will be imposed on all media created IAW this BAA.

Small businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for small business due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.

The government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award instrument determined appropriate under the circumstances. The Government may award single or multiple contracts in accordance with technical priority and funding availability.  Award prices will vary.  The Government reserves the right to select for award, all, some, or none of the parts of a proposal from proposal respondents.  Proposals may be selected for award without discussions or negotiations.

<SOLNBR>KAQ061003
<RESPDATE>063006
<ARCHDATE>05032007
<CONTACT>Steve Hannan Natural Resource Spec, Fuels 3076841144     Steve_Hannan@blm.gov;
<DESC>Project Location: Burnt Hollow Management Area, Campbell County, Wyoming T. 53 N. R. 71 W. Sec. 27, 28, 32, 33 (portions).  All of the lands identified for treatment are public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management, Buffalo Field Office.  Project Access:  From Gillette, the project site is 19 miles north via US Highway 59. The treatment units adjoin the southeast side of the highway right of way and extend up to one half mile to the south east.    Fuel & Site Description: Wyoming Sagebrush 10 to 24 inch height and 15 to 25 % canopy cover. Soils are primarily moderately deep to deep clay loams with few rocks at the surface and top soil horizons. Slopes over the project site average 3% with inclusions of areas having 7 to 10% slope. Drainage is to the west toward the Little Powder River, located less than ? mile from the project.    Job Description: The job consists of pulling a government furnished Dixie Harrow using a tractor of sufficient size to remove sagebrush cover and scarify the soil surface. The resource management objectives are to break up the sagebrush fuel continuity, and improve habitat conditions for greater sage grouse. The treatment objective is to treat approximately 200 acres within the 600 acre treatment units.  There will also be an option to treat an additional 100 acres.   Treatment specifications: The design of the Dixie Harrow plow allows the operator to remove harrow sections to decrease the severity of surface disturbance. The normal treatment will include use of the harrow with all sections attached. The government Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) may require the contractor to treat specified areas using the harrow with one or more sections removed, and or make a second pass in the opposite direction of the first in order to achieve the desired degree of surface disturbance. The harrow treatment blocks shall be irregular-shaped with the harrowing completed in a mosaic of treated and untreated strips. The plowing treatment will be made in an alternating pattern of plowed and un-plowed strips that generally follow the contour of the land and running perpendicular to the slope and watershed drainage. The plowed strips shall be 100 feet or less in width, un-plowed strips shall be 30 to 200 foot or more in width. Generally, un-plowed strips shall be twice as wide as the plowed strips. Surface Conditions:  Harrowing shall not occur under conditions that prevent the proper kill of sagebrush and the proper operation of equipment. These conditions include snow, frozen ground or when the soil exceeds 15% moisture content. Tractor:  Shall be of sufficient size and horsepower to pull the pipe harrow. Minimum tractor requirements are a 150 drawbar horsepower, 4-wheel drive rubber tired tractor or 2WD with dual liquid-filled rear tires. The pipe harrow shall not be pulled in excess of 6 six miles per hour.  Work limits: Work can be completed in August/September/October 2006. The government will flag and/or show contractor the boundaries of treatment areas. Work Measurement: The government will mark the boundary of the treatment areas with engineering tape or pin flags. Each pass with the harrow will count as treated surface. The workload measure for payment under this contract will be the number of acres treated. Calculation of treated acres will be determined by measuring the length of each treated strip and multiplying by the width of the harrow. The length measurements will be made by either ground measure (tape or measuring wheel) or using shape file data collected from a GPS unit mounted on the tractor or an ATV. All of the acreage measurements for payment of the contract will be on a horizontal plane.    Environmental Considerations:  The contractor shall be responsible to clean up the project site and all refuse removed as directed by the Contracting Officer.  Flagged archaeological sites, section corners and leave areas (untreated islands, big game travel lanes, rocky/shallow soil etc.) located within the project area, shall not be disturbed by the Contractor's operations. Existing access roads and roads/jeep trails within the project area that are damaged by the Contractor shall be restored (Contractor's expense) to the same condition they were in at the commencement of work. Work will be stopped on days/times of extreme fire danger and/or if wet/muddy road conditions exist, the government will monitor these conditions. Government Supplied Equipment: The government will provide the Dixie Harrow which will be delivered and unloaded at the job site. Upon completion of work the contractor will return the Dixie Harrow to the closest access point on the Highway 59 Right-of-way.  Project Meetings Show Trip: A project show trip for prospective bidders will be held on June 20, 2006. The meeting time and place may be obtained by contacting the Buffalo Field Office at (307) 684-1100.   Pre-Work Conference: A pre-work conference will be held prior to the start of work. The Contractor will be notified in advance of the meeting time, date, and place. The purpose will be to review required work, project specifications, schedules, payroll and payments, and administrative provisions of the Contract.  During Work Contact: The contractor shall contact the contracting officer's representative (COR), in the Buffalo Field Office, a minimum every other day and/or prior to moving from one treatment area to another to report project status including acres completed.  Final Inspection: The Contractor shall notify the COR at least one business day in advance of completion of the project, so the Government can schedule a final inspection. The Contractor shall correct deficiencies identified and the treatment project will be re-inspected. Payment: Payment will be made for the actual number of acres completed, inspected, and accepted by the Government. The acreage for the purpose of payment is measured on a horizontal plane. The contractor may, at any time during the course of the contract, request re-measurement of any unit he/she thinks is not accurately measured. The method of measurement for acreage determination is discussed in the Work Measurement section.  Contract Award: Award will be based upon the overall advantage to the government including not only price but past performance and ability to perform by the due date the subject contract work.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a contract for engineering services for the development of a data package for preliminary design of a Flexible Payload Module (FPM) for the Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR) missile.  Designing the FPM to the Tactical Tomahawk Vertical launch system (TT VLS) interface will require support to review existing TT VLS operational requirements and interface control documentation; support engineering studies on impact of depth of launch and safety review of the network based control system.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Systems Company (RSC), P O Box 11337, Tucson, AZ  85734-1337.  RSC is the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer of the Tomahawk AUR.  Only RSC 
possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tactical Tomahawk missile.  RSC currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration and verification documents of the TWS.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tactical Tomahawk missile is required to perform this effort, RSC is the only source capable of providing the design, integration , test support and analysis necessary to insure the 12 TT VLS FPM configuration replicates the existing VIRGINIA CLASS Bow payload interface in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command has a requirement to purchase 24 ea,  VHF/UHF communications diplexers for the E-2C Automatic Identification System (AIS) project.  The Government intends to purchase unique diplexers on a sole source basis from North Star Scientific Corporation, 91-238 A Kalaeloa Blvd. Kapolei, HI 96707-1802.   The requirement is for 24 diplexers that are a passive Radio Frequency (RF) filtering device that allows the AIS receiver to share a VHF/UHF antenna with a VHF/UHF radio.  The AIS diplexer must have three input/output ports:  Antenna, 162 MHz (AIS), and 30-400 MHz (VHF/UHF).  The diplexer is connected between the antenna input of the AIS receiver, the antenna input of the VHF/UHF radio and the VHF/UHF antenna and does not require any other connections, such as power or control signals.  The diplexer takes the full VHF and UHF frequency spectrum from the antenna input port and passes only signals in the 161-163 MHz range to the AIS output.  All other frequencies are passed to the 30-400 MHz output.  This is done through the use of band-pass, low-pass, and high-pass filtering.  In the reverse, transmissions from the V/UHF-6 radio are passed from the 30-400 MHz port to the antenna output port and isolated from the AIS port.   The diplexer must be suitable for E-2C aircraft integration and flight tested.  Size, weight and fit are a factor. Only North Star  Scientific AIS diplexer 06-01-001-00 meets the minimum requirements set forth herein.  Delivery is required no later than 28 May 2006 in order to support aircraft deployment.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, responsible parties may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation within 5 days of this notice.  All responses will be considered by the Agency. Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a new requirement for conducting a study to assess the outcomes of a group of lung cancer patients treated with homeopathic therapy in a clinic in Calcutta, India.  Specifically, the OCCAM will support a prospective observational outcome study of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients in this particular homeopathy clinic.  The purpose of this contract is: 1) to document the number of new lung cancer patients seen in the clinic; 2) to identify each patient and determine their eligibility for the outcomes monitoring protocol (protocol will be provided by the OCCAM); 3) to follow 30 of the eligible patients for 2 years after enrollment into the study to assess tumor response, patient survival and quality of life; and 4) to document the homeopathic therapies received by the study participants.

In order to accomplish the aims of this project, the OCCAM will seek Contractors having both expertise in clinical and cancer research, as well as affiliated offices or workforce in India (preferably in Calcutta or with easy means of access, to enable prompt and accurate accomplishments of all contract requirements).  Primary protocol objectives include:  1) Identifying eligible lung cancer patients to participate in the study; and 2) Following up study cohort as per protocol to determine the response rate of tumors detectable by radiography [Chest Computed Tomography Scans (CT scans)] in eligible lung cancer patients entered on this protocol through the P. Banerji Homeopathic Research (PBHRF) clinics.  Secondary protocol objectives include: 1) Progression-free survival of patients; 2) Overall survival of patients; and 3) Assessing changes in patient quality of life after starting therapy through the PBHRF clinics as well as changes in disease-related symptoms (e.g., chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, fatigue, weight loss, etc.) via administration of a validated quality of life assessment tool.  Additional protocol objectives include reviewing charts of additional cases of cancer remissions occurring in patients receiving homeopathic therapy (these cases will be identified on a case by case method as per request of the NCI Project Officer).

An optional supplemental cancer protocol(s) on other types of cancers (e.g., esophageal cancer) may be required to be carried out after the satisfactory completion of the accrual to the lung cancer protocol.  The decision to proceed with the implementation of the supplemental protocol(s) will be made by the NCI Project Officer during the first year of the lung cancer study.  In order to effect this supplemental work, the contract document will be written to include option provisions for each year of the contract.

This is a new requirement and the Request For Proposal (RFP) No. N02-CO-47019 will issued on or about September 15, 2004.  The RFP will be available at the website of the Research Contracts Branch, NCI (http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/). The Government anticipates one contract will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for a period of three years with optional studies that will run concurrently with the base requirements.  The NAICS Code is 621498.  No Collect Calls will be accepted.

Final inspection and acceptance of materials by the Government will occur when materials arrive in Kalaupapa.  The following provisions and clauses are applicable to this acquisition and are available at www.arnet.gov:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions of Offerors-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions, FAR 52.211-11 Liquidated Damages-Supplies, Services, or Research and Development (Sept 2000) (a) If the Contractor fails to deliver the supplies or perform the services within the time specified in this contract, the Contractor shall, in place of actual damages, pay to the Government liquidated damages of $300 per calendar day of delay.  (b) If the Government terminates this contract in whole or in part under the Default-Fixed-Price Supply and Service clause, the Contractor is liable for liquidated damages accruing until the Government reasonably obtains delivery or performance of similar supplies or services. These liquidated damages are in addition to excess costs of repurchase under the Termination clause. (c) The Contractor will not be charged with liquidated damages when the delay in delivery or performance is beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor as defined in the Default-Fixed-Price Supply and Service clause in this contract.  FAR 52.214-34 Submission of Offers in the English Language, FAR 52.214-35 Submission of Offers in U.S. Currency, FAR 52.219-6 Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside, FAR 52.219-8 Utilization of Small Business Concerns, FAR 52.222-3 Limitations on Subcontracting; FAR 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration, FAR 52.247-.34 F.O.B.

The evaluation criteria are listed in descending order of importance.  Award of any contract resulting from this solicitation will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation will be based on best value to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered.  Technical quality is significantly more important than cost or price.  Price will be a factor in the award decision, although the award may not necessarily be made to that offeror submitting the lowest price.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.  As the technical merit and evaluated cost or price becomes essentially equal, other factors may become the determining factor.  The Government reserves the right to make award without further discussion.  Proposals shall be submitted in an original and three copies by no later than 12:00 p.m. on May 19, 2006 to:  Historic Preservation Training Center, 4801A Urbana Pike, Frederick, Maryland  21704.

This order is to be delivered FOB destination at China Lake as soon as possible after date of award, but no later than 8 weeks after receipt of order.  This acquisition supports expansion of the government's advanced technology demonstrator.   This Matrox equipment represents the government's minimum requirement for additional, commercial components required to expand the current demonstrator while maintaining completely interoperability and interchangeability with components currently in use in the demonstrator.  It also supports anticipated future versions of the demonstrator which could maintain the current demonstrator front end, and therefore would req!  uire commercial components which have sufficient bandwidth to handle 4 independent streams of digitized data, and which meet the standard data protocol RS422 regarding simultaneous input for camera link and analog interfaces.  Funds are not available currently to redesign this preproduction version of the demonstrator to utilize different commercial video processor boards.  This competitive procurement is processed under the simplified acquisition procedures at FAR Part 12 and 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.   A Request for Quotes for this requirement is expected to be released on May 8, 2006.  Award is anticipated by June 7, 2006.

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a bridge contract to The Diamond Group for continuation of services from the current contract (NAS9-01055) for 1 year plus four 3-month options.  The Contractor will continue to perform class multi-state/multi-site protective services, security, emergency response, risk assessment, vulnerability analyses, innovative and strategic recommendations for security enhancements and upgrades, and badging operations for the Johnson Space Center (JSC), Ellington Field, Sonny Carter Training Facility, and White Sands Test Facility (WSTF).  The contractor will continue to provide the following: 1.  World class security operation with management and armed security officers who are properly cleared, trained, competent, and who enforce NASA security policies.  The Security Officers man both fixed posts (perimeter entry points and specific building locations) and roving patrol duties.  Roving patrols conduct frequent and random routine checks of grounds and building perimeters, as well as provide emergency response.   2. Continual assessment of the overall security operations at JSC and WSTF.   3.  Trained and qualified emergency operations dispatchers at JSC who provide routine communications and dispatch for security personnel and fire protection personnel and emergency responses.  The dispatchers also monitor security access control systems, security cameras, and other automated security control equipment. 4. Provide to the WSTF, emergency support to White Sands Complex and the U.S. Air Force Communication Facility per local agreement. 5. Investigation support, executive protection for VIPs and NASA senior executives, special response team support (SRT), bomb threat analysis, investigations of security violations and criminal activities, when appropriate, and building and site perimeter inspections. 6. Special event security support. 7. Clerical and administrative support for security clearance investigation checks for US citizens and foreign nationals.  Maintain clearance investigation files. 8. Badging office operations that include a range of clerical and administrative support services required for NASA photo identification badges for US citizens and foreign nationals, and for temporary visitor badges. 9. Provide locksmith services. 10. Provide destruction of sensitive and classified waste materials. NASA/JSC intends to continue to purchase these services from The Diamond Group, from October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007 with four 3-month options through September 30, 2008.  The Government does not believe that competing this effort at this time is to its advantage or to industry's advantage, since the period of performance for this extension is only 1 year with four 3-month options which may or may not be exercised, and any cost savings achieved through competition would be diminished and overshadowed by costs, including phase-in costs, and time delays needed to build relationships with both the Center Operations Directorate and users of the services provided by The Diamond Group.	The Diamond Group currently possesses required company security clearances which allow them to perform the requirements of this contract.  This extension does not allow sufficient time for a new contractor to receive National Industrial Security Program (NISP) certification.  However, NASA does intend to complete this effort in the near future potentially under a NASA multi-center procurement. No information currently exists regarding this security contract however potential offerors are reminded to continually monitor FEDBIZOPS for any future NASA announcements. Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 17, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

INTRODUCTION:  This document defines the scope of work, with deliverables, to be accomplished by the Contractor for the Department of the Interior (DOI). Scope of Work U.S. Department of the Interior International Technical Assistance Program For International Workshop on Economics of Natural Protected Areas General Description.  The Contractor shall furnish all services, materials, supplies, instruction and travel as required, in connection with the work described herein.  The workshop shall be in accordance with all instructions as set forth in this contract.  The Scope of Work shall consist of a 5-day workshop to instruct 25 professional government and non-government participants on economics of natural resources in relation to natural protected areas in Peru. The training will occur in or within a 1-hour drive from Lima, Peru.  This contract will be completed as a single event workshop to instruct staff from the Government of Peru on economic themes as they relate to natural protected areas.  The Contractor shall implement one 5-day workshop in or within a 1-hour drive from Lima, Peru that will provide technical training on the economics of natural resources, which includes the analysis of environmental values, micro-economics, and cost-benefit analysis.     Background. The U.S. Department of the Interior's (DOI) International Technical Assistance Program (ITAP), with funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development/Peru  (USAID/Peru), is providing training and technical assistance in support of USAID/Peru's protected area management efforts with the National Institute of Natural Resources (INRENA).  DOI intends to issue a contract to provide a 5-day training workshop for 25 participants from INRENA resource management staff and representatives from other government agencies involved in resource management.  Specific economic themes will include analysis of environmental values, micro-economics, economics of natural resources, and cost-benefit analysis. Currently, INRENA is faced with extreme budgetary shortfalls in managing protected areas. Generally, visitor fees from protected areas in Peru generate only about 10 percent of the revenue needed to manage those areas.  DOI is working with INRENA staff to improve the budgetary support of protected areas by using economic tools to estimate the actual and potential importance of Peru's system of protected areas versus current expenditures for their use and protection.  The purpose of this action would be to help INRENA demonstrate and justify the need for greater budget allocations for the management of protected areas.  It is anticipated that a comprehensive valuation of protected areas, and improved management and control, would yield economic returns to the Government of Peru that would more than offset the higher costs of management and control.  INRENA is directed to manage a system of protected areas under the Protected Natural Areas Law (No. 26834) of 1997.  In 2003, INRENA was responsible for managing 57 protected areas totaling 12.7 percent of the surface area of Peru.  These areas include 10 National Parks, 9 National Reserves, and 13 Reserve Zones.  In all, there are 9 categories of protection that total 16 million hectares.   INRENA is in need of additional economic support to finance the management of the 57 protected areas.  One of the first steps in developing budgetary support for protected areas is to train INRENA staff and other Peruvian government agency staff in the economics of natural protected areas.  DOI is looking to initiate this workshop to provide training to INRENA staff on cost-benefit analyses for protected areas.  DOI is also looking to provide general guidance to participants on the economics of natural areas, with the expected outcome that participants will leave with a very high level of understanding of economic benefits provided by natural protected areas.  Scope of Work. The Contractor shall provide an intensive 5-day workshop divided into two sections: (1) one-day training for representatives of all identified government agencies involved in resource management, covering economic themes in an overview workshop style (to occur during first day of workshop); (2) training for INRENA staff only, with training focused in more detail on economics of natural resources and cost-benefit analysis (to occur during remaining 4 days of workshop). Topics covered will include:  tools to effectively analyze environmental values and apply micro-economics and conduct cost-benefit analyses in the management of protected areas; pitfalls and issues with economics of natural resources; and conducting economic evaluations of protected areas.  The training provided will consist of a combination of presentations, exercises, market simulations, analysis of local data, and evaluations of protected areas.  Specific economic themes will include analysis of environmental values, micro-economics, economics of natural resources, and cost-benefit analysis.   The workshop will also provide training on environmental resource value determination, market and politics in conserving environmental resources, and the environmental economy.  The first day of the workshop will provide an introduction of economic methods for improved conservation of biodiversity and the management of natural resources.   The contractor must develop class exercises for this workshop that are specific to Peru and can be applied to natural protected areas in Peru.  The contractor must present the workshop in Spanish and provide written materials for the class in Spanish.   The contractor must guide participants through an application of benefit-cost analysis for a selected protected area in Peru.  This is especially important, since workshop participants will need to take the skills learned in the course and apply them to newly created protected areas within Peru. Minimum Qualifications of Contractor.  The contractor must demonstrate 3 years of experience working with Latin American governments within the realm of natural resource economics.  The contractor must also have a minimum of 3 years of experience working internationally with natural resource government agencies.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for One (1) Magnetic Filter Plasma Source, Retarding Potential Analyzer (RPA) System.  The salient characteristics are: 1) Produces a low temperature plasma (&lt;0.1 eV) 2) Produces a streaming plasma (velocities in the 1-10 km/s range) 3) Produces a dense plasma (densities of 100,000 to 1 million electrons per cubic centimeter) 4) Uses xenon gas 5) Uses a magnetic field to produce the low plasma temperatures 6) Operates with gas flow rates in the 1-10 standard cubic centimeter per minute range. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Colorado State University.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1. Colorado State University developed a Magnetic Filter Plasma Source using grant funds.   It is unique because it has a low temperature (&lt;0.1 eV) streaming plasma.	This device and its accompanying retarding potential analyzer (RPA) is compatible with vacuum chamber operation at MSFC where the LEO testing is to be done.	It is necessary for the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) plasma testing to be performed at MSFC. 2.  Installation and testing of these devices, as well as on-site training in their use, are necessary for the testing to be performed at MSFC.	Nobody but the vendor can do the on-site installation and training. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on May 16, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Non-Oxide Adhesive eXperimental -Revision D (NOAX-D) Reinforced Carbon-Carbon Repair Material. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from ATK Thiokol, Inc., an affiliant of Alliant Techsystems, Inc., pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  The development of an on-orbit Crack Repair Material (CRM) for the Space Shuttle orbiter wing leading edge represents a state-of-the-art technological advancement.  This advancement is based in part upon the CRM's ability to be applied in the harsh environs of space and still survive the high temperatures of re-entry.  Several known materials have already been tested and determined to be inadequate for this effort.  During the CRM down select in fall of 2004 the unique ceramic adhesive, NOAX-D supplied by only ATK Thiokol, Inc., was the only known CRM that performed in accordance with the technical requirements.  2.  NOAX-D is a paste-like polymer which functions as an environmental barrier to retard oxidation of the carbon/carbon substrate of the Shuttle's Wing Leading Edge.  Since the initial CRM down select in the fall of 2004, NOAX-D has gone through extensive testing and evaluation in route to certification of Safe to Fly, Safe to Apply, and Safe to Repair for the Space Shuttle.  Through the current MSFC technical effort, NOAX-D has been certified Safe to Fly and Safe to Apply due to meeting and/or mitigating various safety and contamination requirements for handling NOAX-D on the Space Shuttle and International Space Station. As part of this continuing effort, it is anticipated that the material will be certified "Safe to Repair" based on computer modeling and test data ensuring that repairs made with NOAX-D can safely re-enter.  NOAX-D is worked in place by a crew member using a spatula to cover the repair site.  After application during the early stages of re-entry, NOAX-D will convert to a ceramic/glass state via pyrolysis (~750-1470 degrees Fareinheit).  Once fully pyrolized, the repair will be capable of surviving temperatures up to a maximum of 2960 degrees Fareinheit for 1200 seconds.  3.  As stated previously, ATK Thiokol invented NOAX-D, and the material is only available from them.  In addition ATK has intimate experience with the formulation, mixing, packaging, and application of NOAX-D by working and developing the CRM over the last 2 years; this previous experience is of vital interest to the Agency.  ATK Thiokol is currently the only qualified vendor who can produce NOAX-D for the Agency, and	change would require a re-qualification and certification process costing unacceptable budget and schedule impacts.  In order to maintain continuity of the research and development activities, it is considered an impractical, as well as inefficient, use of resources to seek a contractor different from the one who initiated the technical effort. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 17, 2006. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>General:  This project is to provide services for the collection of rangeland data on selected sample sites (points) for the National Resources Inventory (NRI), Rangeland Field Study in Texas.  The intent of this Agency is to solicit the most efficient and effective manner to complete the requirements of this inventory.  The performance period will begin on or about June 12, 2006 and must be completed by November 15, 2006. 

Background:  The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is mandated (through the Rural Development Act of 1972, the Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act of 1977, and other supporting legislation) to assess the status, condition, and trends of soil, water, and related resources on the National non-Federal lands.  Resources inventory legislative authorities, NRCS policy, and responsibilities for conducting the NRI are contained in NRCS General Manual 290, Part 400.
 
Objective/Scope:  The objective of this solicitation is to acquire specified inventory data on two data points in each of about 122 primary sample units (PSU) (a total of about 244 data points) located in 13 counties within the state of Texas, specifically:  Blanco (15 PSU’s), DeWitt (11 PSU’s), Hays (10 PSU’s), Caldwell (6 PSU’s), Fayette (4 PSU’s), Calhoun (14 PSU’s), Travis (13 PSU’s), Goliad (11 PSU’s), Bastrop (9 PSU’s), Brazoria (5 PSU’s), Gonzales (7 PSU’s), Victoria (8 PSU’s), and Matagorda (9 PSU’s).     
      
General Rangeland Inventory Data Elements:  The following categories characterize general data collection needs:  (a) GPS navigation to points and point position capture; (b) ownership; (c) land cover/ use; (d) landscape and soils; (e) ecological site information;(f) rangeland health indicators; (g) noxious weeds and invasive/alien plants; (h) disturbance indicators; (i) conservation practices and resource concerns; (j) line point transects for cover composition; (k) line intercept transects for basal and canopy gaps; (l) cover density and height (Robel Pole); and (m) species composition by weight, production and Similarity Index (SI).

Data Collection:  All data will be recorded in the field on GPS-based Computer Assisted Survey Instruments (CASI) preloaded with government designed and authorized software.

Workload and Logistics:   It is anticipated that 2 persons will be required at each site to physically collect and enter data into the CASI.  It is estimated that one PSU (2 points) can be completed within 16 to 18 total staff hours.

Confidentiality Statement:  Successful contractor(s) will be required to sign a confidential agreement under UNITED STATES CODE, Title 18, Section 1905; UNITED STATES CODE, Title7, Section 2276 and UNITED STATES CODE, Title 7, Section 2240 for non-disclosure of confidential information relative to data site locations and/or use of composite data.

This will be a Request for Proposal (RFP) acquisition for a firm fixed-price contract using both price and past performance.  Prior to contract award the contractor must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  The NAICS Code is 541990.  This project is restricted to Small Business.  Registration in TechReg (TSP) is not required, but highly encouraged.  Solicitation will be posted and be available to download on or about May 12, 2005.  Price range is $250,000 - $500,000.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR ALON AND SPINEL OPTICAL CERAMICS.  This is a pre-solicitation synopsis which is not a request for competitive proposals.  The work will establish an integrated, domestic source of transparent optical ceramics made from each of two materials, ALON and spinel, and it will scale up manufacturing capacity for transparent optical ceramics made from both materials.  The DPA Title III Program Office intends to award an Assistance Instrument or a contract, as appropriate, on the basis of other than full and open competition for this requirement to Surmet Corporation, 33 B Street, Burlington, MA 01803.  Under the authority of Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. App. Section 2061 et seq.), the Title III Program Office is contemplating this procurement to establish a U.S. owned, domestic, merchant supplier of transparent optical ceramic components made of each of the two materials:  aluminum oxynitride (ALON) and magnesium aluminate spinel (spinel).  The establishment of a domestic source which addresses all aspects of the production of both ALON and spinel, from powder synthesis through final optical polishing, will alleviate current issues that exist with reliance on multiple sources, some of them foreign, for various aspects of the production processes.  The scale-up of production capacity for such components is needed to meet future DoD requirements for windows and domes for infrared systems and for transparent armor.  The period of performance for the Phase I procurement is anticipated to be 15 months. A description of the task is as follows:  Establish a domestic source of both ALON and spinel transparent optical ceramic components; scale up production capacity for transparent optical ceramic components, made of both ALON and spinel, to meet quantity requirements for the Department of Defense.  The ability of the offeror to scale up production and accomplish the related goals of this program will be assessed based on the offeror’s demonstrated ability to routinely produce both ALON and spinel components that exhibit a high degree of optical transparency in both the visible and the near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, along with very good index-of-refraction homogeneity, in the size range of 14” x 20” for ALON and 12” x 12” for spinel.  Transmittance greater than 80%, over the wavelength region from 0.4 - 4 microns, is required for 2-mm-thick samples of ALON, and from 0.4 - 5 microns for 2-mm-thick samples of spinel.  Variation in the index of refraction on the order of 5 ppm or less, over the center 3 inches of the lens blank, and less than 10 ppm over a 4.7-inch diameter, is also required.  Additional phases to further increase production capacity may be undertaken depending on the eventual quantity demanded and the availability of funding.  The government intends to issue an award for these requirements on a Sole Source basis per FAR 6.302-1(a)(1), “Only One Responsible Source” or  “DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations 37.400 (b),” based on Surmet’s demonstrated relevant experience, and on lack of knowledge of comparable experience on the part of any potential competitor.  Offerors who are capable of meeting the requirements stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  This documentation shall specify the offeror’s area of expertise and experience.  It shall include detailed descriptions of both ALON and spinel transparent optical ceramic components, currently produced as a military and industrial supplier, with demonstrated ability to manufacture and deliver ALON and spinel that meets the requirements set forth above.  The documentation shall include a listing of products and services currently offered as a merchant industrial supplier along with market share in the area and a list of customer organizations currently using the components.  The documentation shall identify relevant past, present, and future research, along with information on research budgets, personnel, and facilities.  The offeror shall document their experience in transitioning product from R&D to production.  Optical components that are made of materials other than aluminum oxynitride or magnesium aluminate spinel are not of interest to the government for this procurement.  Nor is the government interested, for this procurement, in companies who provide components of either ALON or spinel, but not both.  Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered.  Direct all questions pertaining to this acquisition to the contracting points of contact listed above in this announcement.  Only one responsible source per capability of interest and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as per the authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  All responsible sources may submit information, which shall be considered by the agency.  Any information received for this Notice of Contract Action will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Numbered Note 22.

Georgia- High Voltage Transmission Line.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for development of a second high voltage transmission line in the Republic of Georgia.

The weakness of Georgia’s power sector is one of the biggest obstacles to the country’s economic growth.  Georgia imports the bulk of its energy needs, including natural gas and oil products.  The nation does, however, have significant domestic electricity generation resources, notwithstanding its lack of fossil fuel.   It is relatively rich in hydropower resources, particularly in the western region of the nation, where 85% of this capacity is concentrated.  Hydropower generated electricity accounts for 81% of the power consumed by the population.  Despite a diverse fuel supply base, electricity supply has been problematic.  Several times throughout 2003 and 2004, non-payment disputes between Georgia and its natural gas and electricity suppliers, Russia and Armenia, have caused intermittent supply disruptions.  Georgia experienced outages in January 2003 when a natural gas line from Russia was accidentally ruptured, resulting in rolling power outages and the total shutdown of public transportation.  Several other malfunctions in recent history have left the populace without power for days at a time.  Neighboring Turkey is actively seeking new sources of energy, invigorating the already active market for energy export in the Caucasus region.  In an attempt to ameliorate power reliability issues, decrease national reliance upon foreign sources of power, and increase revenues through power export to Turkey, the Georgians have revisited long dormant plans to construct additional high voltage power lines in Georgia.

Georgia has one 500kV transmission line which runs east to west.  A second 500 kV transmission grid reinforcement project was started in 1989.  However, in 1992, the project was abandoned due to inadequate funding and the line was never completed.  Since then, many of the installed components have been stolen.  

Completing this line is one of the Ministry of Energy’s main priorities and it has targeted this project for implementation in 2006-08.  The Ministry has already taken steps to further develop hydropower resources to supply the additional power to this line and is in discussions with the World Bank on the Khudoni Hydropower plant project.  The Ministry believes this project will help turn around the electricity sector in Georgia and provide some profit, which it can use for further investments in the sector.  This second line would allow Georgia to take power from its summertime hydropower resources for export to neighboring countries. This 500 kV line is estimated to cost $80 million and would take 2-3 years to complete.  An additional line to connect to the Turkish system is also being contemplated as an extension to this second kV line.  The Cabinet of Ministers and Regulatory Commission have lent their support to this project and the project is ranked at the top of the Government of Georgia’s sector development priorities.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland intends to award a Sole Source follow-on contract to NOETIC SOFTWARE, INC of Willow Grove, Pennsylvania to write, test, modify, and correct the communication, display, and navigation unit (CDNU) software for the Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System (AIMS) installed in the CH-46 helicopter.  The procurement of these services from Noetic will allow the government to rapidly integrate the most recent AIMS software load into the CDNU software without expanding current code or lose current functionality.  While other companies could eventually perform these services, Noetic software is the only company capable of providing these services without substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable time delays.  As a result, Noetic is able to preserve the ability to easily incorporate additional AIMS enhancements that are expected in near future.  The intended period of performance for this contract is one year beginning 1 July 2006 with options for two additional years.  This synopsis is for informational purposes only.  Note 22 Applies.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Sharon Beermann-Curtin, Program Manager-MTO, Phone 571-218-4935, Fax 703-696-2206, Email sharon.beerman-curtin@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovating research proposals in the area of micro-meter scale energy storage.  

The Department of Defense continues to develop very small remote sensors, robotic devices and electronic systems.  The computing and sensing technologies as well as the sensors on these micro systems continue to shrink in volume, weight, and power requirements.   In many cases, the limiting component for the overall lifetime, volume, or weight of these small systems is the power source.

The challenge is to develop high energy dense, low volume power sources, which are scalable to fit the energy needs of micro electromechanical systems (MEMS), and easily integrated into various small device and systems architectures.

The development and demonstration of these power sources is the subject of this solicitation. 


PROGRAM SCOPE

The MPS Program will consist of three Phases with contractor defined Go Ahead critical milestones at the end of each phase. Clearly stated, quantitative milestones at each phase with clearly defined deliverables are required. Organizations wishing to participate in Phases II and III should include them as options in their proposal. It is expected that proposers will deliver between 2-5 prototype power sources to the Government for testing and integration on a relevant micro system to determine performance at the end of each phase of the program. Offerers will also be responsible for monthly technical progress reports. A list and timetable of deliverables should be included in the proposal. Multiple awards are anticipated. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort. Questions concerning this BAA may be directed to the technical POC for this effort, Ms. Sharon Beermann-Curtin, sharon.beermann-curtin@darpa.mil.

Teaming is strongly encouraged but is not a requirement. The viability of teaming arrangements, including tasks and measurable milestones for each team member, should be clearly explained in the proposal.  Emphasis will be placed on integrated approaches, i.e. integrated teams formed to better address the wide breadth of technological and scientific aspects of the MPS Program. For example, areas of expertise that might be incorporated into these teams include materials science, device physics, design, simulation, fabrication, testing, and integration, etc. Teaming between industries, commercial and defense system integrators, federal and national laboratories, and universities with complementary areas of expertise is strongly encouraged.  

Each team will address the challenges discussed above and form an integrated program leading to functional, high performance energy sources.  We realize that this is a challenging and high-risk program.  In order to mitigate risk, we envision that different teams with different technical approaches will be supported.  

A website (http://teaming.sysplan.com/BAA-06-033/index.cgi) has been established to facilitate teaming between interested parties.  Interested parties may post on the web site the points of contact (POC), their address, telephone and fax numbers, e-mail information and any non-proprietary information about their areas of expertise and interest that may help in forming the teams.  Specific information content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibilities of the participants. Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination website or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination. This website is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA.


GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled “BAA 06-33, Micro-Power Sources (MPS), Proposer Information Pamphlet” which provides further information on the objectives of the MPS BAA the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, Grants.Gov website: http://www.grants.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  Proposers must submit an original and five (5) copies of the full proposal as specified in the Proposer Information Pamphlet, along with two (2) electronic copies (i.e., two (2) separate disks) of the full proposal [in PDF (preferred), or MS-Word readable, each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a CD-ROM].  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 06-33, offeror organization, proposal title (short title recommended), and Copy __ of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 06-33) on or before 12:00 p.m., local time, Wednesday, May 26, 2006, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps and Grants.Gov.  Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds. This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 06-33 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received and to make awards without discussion.  In the event that DARPA desires to award only portions of a proposal, negotiations will be opened with that offeror.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), and Small and Small Disadvantaged Businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for these organizations’ participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in Micro-Power Sources (MPS). 

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 06-33.  Proposals and proposal abstracts may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the http://www.darpa.mil/mto/solicitations/index.html for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.

<CONTACT>Thomas Bordone, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-254-2319, Fax 202-254-2271, Email thomas.bordone@dhs.gov
<DESC>A critical component of the Department of Homeland Security’s Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) nuclear countermeasures architecture is a passive gamma and neutron radiation detection portal (termed the Advanced Spectroscopic Portal) suitable for examining cargo containers, trucks, personally owned vehicles, mail and bundled cargo.  The Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) system will use the full gamma radiation spectrum and total neutron count rate from the inspected material to make a detection and identification decision.  The gamma radiation detectors in the ASP system utilize thallium enhanced sodium iodide (NaI) crystals to absorb the gamma radiation, and with the assistance of the electronics, the device records the energy of the gamma radiation.  Since each isotope in nature gives off a unique energy pattern, the collected data is used to evaluate whether the radiating material is a threat to the public or benign.   

To obtain contractors to produce and supply these gamma radiation detectors, DNDO is conducting a full and open competition, with the selected firms being awarded production contracts.  This solicitation will result in multiple Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contracts.  Vendors are requested to propose on various production levels as specified in the solicitation.  In addition, a portion of the requirement has been set-aside for small business.

A draft of this solicitation was posted on FedBizOps on February 10, 2006.  The final version of solicitation has been revised to reflect various changes and to incorporate the results of the industry comment on the draft.  Also attached are the questions/comments received on the draft, with the Government’s response.  In addition, attached is a redline version of the draft solicitation which reflects the changes that have been made between the draft solicitation that was published on February 10, 2006 and final version of the RFP.  In the event of any inconsistency between these documents, the final version of the RFP shall govern.  Vendors should note that hard copies of the proposals are to be submitted to the address specified in Section L.4.  Any questions on this solicitation must be sent no later than 2:00, March 30, 2006, as specified in section L.3.9.  Offerors may send electronic copies of their proposal in addition to the hard copies, however, offerors should note that the electronic transmissions of the proposals are not secure, and are therefore not a requirement of the response.  It is the Respondent’s responsibility to periodically review either of these websites for notices, amendments, updates, questions and answers and changes to the posted information.

<DESC>A—INTRODUCTION -- MNK-BAA-06-0001B (Flash/Staring Ladar Seeker (SLS)  Special Amendment) (Part 2 of 2):

C--ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

(1) Type of Contract:  The Government anticipates negotiating one Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract for this effort, but does not preclude other actualities if it is determined to be in the Government’s best interest.  

(2) Expected Award Date:  Late September, 2006.

(3) Anticipated Period of Performance:  The SLS Program contract is anticipated to take 45 months. 

(4) Government Estimate:  The Government expects to fund up to approximately $7.475K on contract for this program (baseline effort plus 2 priced options).  This figure includes approximately $20K, $1,671K, $1,995K, $2,685K and $1,104K in each of FY06-FY10, respectively.  This funding profile is an estimate only and is not a promise of funding, as all funding is subject to changes/availability and Government discretion.  

(5) Government Furnished Items (GFI):  The Government may assist in providing GFI, based on availability, if requested.  Therefore, the offeror shall include a detailed list of Government resources (material formulation instructions, lethality assessment software, target models, etc.), and their associated approximate costs, required to execute a contract in a timely and cost effective manner.  

(6) Request For Technical Annex:  Technical annex, Minimum Performance Factors for the SLS, as it applies to precision guided munitions, may be obtained by sending a certified copy of a DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, appropriate clearance data, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and approved mailing address to Capt Jade Lemery via email, mail or fax (see Section F – Points of Contact, paragraph (2)).  After acceptance of these items, this data package may be obtained in person or via U.S. mail.  Request should be provided early enough to allow the Government 14 days to provide the document.  No supplemental documentation will be provided unless requested in strict accordance with these instructions.

(7) Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms:  It has been formally determined that foreign participation will be prohibited.  Exceptions may include those contractors with an agreement with the US State Department and a current facility clearance, copies of which should be provided to Section F Points of Contact.  

(8)  Hazardous Materials:  The contractor must identify any hazardous materials to be used in performance of this effort in the White Paper and any subsequently requested Formal Proposal.

D-- WHITE PAPER AND PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:

(1) White Papers:  White Papers should address all areas indicated by the Evaluation Factors in Section E – Basis for Award, including how the contractor intends to achieve the objectives/requirements outlined in Section B—Requirements, of this Amendment for the entire program.  Applicable experience and past performance and data rights should be addressed.  A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate should be provided and should indicate annual funding as well as major sub-effort funding requirements.  Additionally, the white papers shall include any partners, subcontractors, etc., to be utilized, discuss risk (schedule and otherwise) assessment and technology maturity level required to meet requirements.  Finally, the white papers should be structured to reflect the baseline effort and priced options described in Section B item 4.

 (2) General:  All offerors should apply the restrictive notice prescribed in the provision at FAR 52.215-1 (e), Restriction on Disclosure and Use of Data, to trade secrets or privileged commercial and financial information contained in their proposals.  For formal proposals, submit separate Technical and Cost Volumes, and mark them as valid for 180 days.  Volume 1 should provide the Technical Proposal addressing the objectives/ requirements and should be unclassified, if possible.  Anyelectrically. Improved system performance will be realized through increased frame rates, elimination of the need for motion compensation, and increased area coverage.  In addition, with agile or electronic scanning techniques it is expected that staring Ladar seekers will provide a simultaneous search and track function due to its fast frame rates.

Because this is expected to be a single contract award, potential offerors should, at a minimum, possess and have demonstrated experience in a variety of technology areas. Some of the key technology areas include laser physics, optical detector arrays, read out integrated circuit (ROIC) design, ATA algorithms, and system integration.  The laser developed under this program must have sufficient output power to achieve the system signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) necessary for accurate 3D imaging at ranges commensurate with guided munition operation. (See Technical Annex) In addition, the laser operation must provide the range resolution (See Technical Annex) necessary to perform ATA functions with accuracy.  The purpose of the optical detector array is to sense the laser energy reflected from objects, which may include non-cooperative targets, within the FOV. The detector array developed under this program must be large enough to cover the FOV (See Technical Annex) while providing sufficient number of pixels on target (at range) to successfully perform the ATA functions encountered in autonomously guided weapon operation.  The detector array must have adequate sensitivity such that, when combined with the received laser power, a reasonable amount of return signal is detected and accurate 3D imaging can occur.  Clearly, the offeror must understand and be able to provide and defend a detailed system SNR analysis. The system SNR is a strong function of the seeker design and components chosen and directly impacts seeker performance. Also, the responsivities within the detector array must be sufficiently uniform across the pixel field or non-uniformity corrections (NUC) will be required to accurately measure range, intensity, and then perform the necessary ATA functions. Finally, it is important for the offeror to be able to present and defend detector designs that meet the bandwidth requirements associated with the range resolution and accuracy needed (See Technical Annex). The purpose of the ROIC is to accept the output of the detector array and, through appropriate circuit design, perform amplification if necessary and determine accurate range and intensity values at the pixel level. The range and intensity values are then sent to a processor that performs the ATA functions. More advanced ROIC designs may include logic for multiple returns within the same pixel and/or fully sample the detector output at the pixel level.  The purpose of the ATA algorithms is to accept the parallel data stream output from the Ladar sensor, process that data, and pass on decision-based information to various seeker controls. As part of that decision-based process, the ATA algorithms are required to perform target acquisition, classification, identification, and aim point selection. Each of these capabilities is a strong function of range to target, range resolution, and pixels on target.  Adequate system integration plays a key role in this effort.  AFRL/MNGS has invested almost $10M in developing and demonstrating staring Ladar seeker technologies.  Under this effort, the final deliverable will have to meet minimum performance factors (MPFs) including a volumetric constraint commensurate with integration to a precision guided weapon.  The MPFs are available to all qualified contractors.  Reference paragraph (6) Request for Technical Annex in C--Additional Information.  

(3)  Test Support:  The contractor shall be responsible for all test plans necessary for the maturation and demonstration of the hardware and software products to be tested.  Contractor-generated test plans, as approved by the Government, are expected to become schedule milestones.  For tests being conducted at Government facilities, the contractor shall be responsible for providing technical support, analysis, data and test planning support to the identified responsible Government test organization.  The contractor shall provide test support to include the following: support of test planning meetings; test setup advice; test article build up; checkout; installation of hardware; instrumentation package support required documentation for testing; identification of risk and suggestion of improvements; record test setup; data collection for evaluation of results; post-test analysis and test result documentation.  It is expected that ground-based tests will be conducted.

(4)  Program Tasking:  This development effort will consist of a baseline effort and two priced options.  The baseline effort will include modeling & simulation and design activities supporting preliminary design and critical design milestones.  Option 1 will include subcomponent fabrication, laboratory testing, and final system-level design.  Option 2 will include system integration & ground-based testing.  In order to proceed to Option 1 and Option 2 of development, the offeror will be required to meet AFRL/MNGS defined criteria as outlined below.  

(a) Baseline effort to Option 1 gate: The criteria to proceed with Option 1 will be based on the soundness of the design approach as well as ability to address the system requirements and applicable parameters described in the technical annex.  The Critical Design Review (CDR) will be the decision point to continue with Option 1.  

(b) Option 1 to Option 2 gate: The criteria to proceed with Option 2 will be based on subcomponent verification testing and soundness of the final system-level design.  If given approval to proceed with Option 2, the contractor will complete the system level integration and demonstrate the seeker in ground-based tests.

(5) Management:  The contractor shall be responsible for meeting all requirements of this contract, including but not limited to, cost, technical, schedule, and security.  The contractor shall communicate the technical and programmatic status through Data Requirements submissions discussed in Section/paragraph B(6) and scheduled meetings discussed in Section/paragraph B(7).  In addition to formal design reviews, informal program status interchanges (such as weekly teleconferences) are encouraged.  The contractor shall provide technical risk assessment, program schedule and cost of contract.  
  
(6) Data Requirements: The following data submittals are expected to be required for any awarded contract.

<DESC>A—INTRODUCTION -- MNK-BAA-06-0001B (Flash/Staring Ladar Seeker (SLS)  Special Amendment) (Part 1 of 2):

The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Seekers Branch (AFRL/MNGS) is interested in receiving white papers for the Flash/Staring Ladar Seeker (SLS) Program under this Special Amendment to the Armament Technology Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) MNK-BAA-06-0001, Research Area 7 – Laser Radar Component Research.  The SLS program is one part of a coordinated set of technology development programs being initiated by AFRL/MN to enable the capabilities envisioned under the Area Dominance Integrating Concept (ADIC).  The goal of the ADIC is to develop & transition technologies needed for a next-generation, persistent (i.e. loitering) munition capability to hold & deny area access.  The SLS will provide persistent search function using high resolution 3D Ladar.  In addition, the SLS will perform low false alarm rate target identification (ID).  Upon positive target ID the AD munition will execute target attack.  The challenge is to design a robust suite of technologies that will integrate into a low-cost solution.

White paper submittals should reference “MNK-BAA-06-0001B (SLS)”.  Where the instructions in MNK-BAA-06-0001 differ from the instructions in this Special Amendment, this document prevails.  White papers should not exceed 30 letter-size pages, using either Arial or Times New Roman font, with not less than 12-pitch type size, and should be submitted not later than 3 PM Central Time to AFRL/MNK on 5 Jun 06.  White papers should include a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost for the SLS Program.  It is anticipated that one of the white papers may be selected for further consideration, and the originators may subsequently be requested to submit formal written technical and cost proposals, with the intent of negotiating a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract for the SLS Program.  However that number could change, depending upon the Government’s needs and successful negotiations.  Six hard copies and one electronic copy (on a CD or DVD) of the white papers should be submitted to the AFRL/MNK Contracting Office to the parties shown in Section F – Points of Contact, paragraph (1).  Email submissions will not be accepted.  A confirmation of receipt may be generated via email as white papers are received (if an email address is provided with the white paper).  All submittals received will be reviewed and evaluated using the Evaluation Criteria found in Section E - Basis for Award.  Offerors should be alert to any amendments that may be published.  The Government reserves the right to amend due dates or other data as necessary, and to make awards without discussions.

B--REQUIREMENTS:  

(1) Program Objective:  The objective of this effort is to develop and demonstrate a staring Ladar seeker (SLS) for autonomously guided munitions. The period of performance for this program is expected to be approximately 45 months.

(2) Program Description: The future evolution of Ladar seekers is towards system architectures based on focal plane array (FPA) technologies, ranging and reflectance imaging techniques. This program will develop a FPA-based Ladar seeker and integrate newly developed Autonomous Target Acquisition (ATA) algorithms for use with future autonomously guided weapons. Such a development represents the next generation of Ladar seekers.  A staring Ladar seeker will illuminate the entire field of view (FOV) and produce 3D imagery using a large array of detectors with the appropriate pulse capture electronics and a reflectance image. The FPA-based Ladar is expected to result in reduced cost, increased robustness, and improved seeker performance relative to existing raster scanned systems. Reduced costs will be realized through the elimination/simplification of the scanning mechanisms (currently 2 axis gimbals). Increased robustness will be realized through overall system simplification both mechanically and  classified material must be provided in a separate Annex and must be properly marked and handled as such.  Provide classified material directly to Capt Jade Lemery rather than to AFRL/MNK.  Volume 2, Cost Proposal, must be unclassified, and should address the price, cost details, and a risk assessment of the proposal.  Questions should be directed to the appropriate points of contact listed in Section F.    

(3) Technical Proposal:  In the event that the white paper results in an invitation to submit a Formal Proposal, Volume 1 -Technical Proposal shall include, as a minimum, a detailed Statement of Work (SOW) for the contract and a contract schedule based on the baseline effort and priced options described in Section B item 4.    Volume 1 should fully address the approach in accomplishing the Program objectives/requirements of Section B above.  The contractor must also provide a summary of relevant past and present performance.  Relevant past and present performance is defined as performance by the proposed program manager, lead technical investigator and/or chief engineer supporting staring Ladar development programs within the last five years, or past efforts by other key personnel proposed by the offeror for performance of this contract.  State the capacity in which these individuals acted in these relevant programs.  The offeror must provide sufficient technical discussion and technical detail to establish the soundness of the proposed approach; provide an adequate basis for assessing program technical cost and schedule risk; and form a sound basis for the cost proposed in Volume 2.  Proposals failing to provide adequate technical detail and discussion may be considered technically unresponsive to this BAA Special Amendment.  In this proposal, the contractor must demonstrate knowledge of the systems engineering process and make realistic assumptions of how the proposed technology increases performance at the missile system level.	

(4) Cost Proposal:  The Volume 2 Formal Cost Proposal must include and segregate the contract costs, and also provide a total summary.  It must reflect the baseline effort and priced options described in Section B item 4 separately.  The contract costs shall include, as a minimum, a labor category and man-hour breakdown including applicable labor rates, a cost element summary including labor, material, travel, other direct costs, overheads, G&A, etc., and reflecting all rates for the contract and data, and an expenditure schedule for the entire program.  The offeror shall include estimates for the cost/value of any Government-Furnished Equipment/Property/Information, etc. requested, and all costs expected to be incurred by the Government associated with providing the equipment, facilities, support, etc., necessary to meet the contractor’s testing requirements.  Any costs associated with data or data rights shall be separately identified in the cost proposal.  Any awardee should expect to certify cost and pricing data in accordance with FAR 15.  

(5) Page Limitations:  White Papers are limited to 30 pages, which will include a ROM cost estimate.  Formal Technical Proposal shall be limited to a total of 50 pages, including charts, figures, tables, etc.  Proposed SOWs  and resumes may be included as appendices, and will not be counted in the page limitations.  The Government reserves the right to remove and return to the offeror any excess pages before the formal evaluation starts.  Formal Cost Proposal will have no page limitation; however, the offeror is requested to keep the cost proposal to 30 pages -- less, if possible.  Cost proposal spreadsheets must be submitted in Microsoft Excel format.  A page is defined to be one side of an 8.5 x 11-inch piece of paper with information on it.  Minimum print size is 12-pitch, using Arial or Times New Roman font, with line spacing of not less than one and one-half for the typeface used (no more than 34 lines per page) for formal proposals.  White Papers may be single-spaced.  Five hard copies should be provided.  Proposals shall be submitted as an original document plus five paper copies, and one copy of both the Technical and Cost Proposals should be submitted on CD or DVD.   Note:  Submittal of a proposal constitutes contractor’s authorization for limited reproduction and dissemination within Government agencies and National Laboratories for evaluation purposes only, as stated in FAR 52.215-1(e).  

(6) Preparation Costs:  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract, or any other contract.  It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Offerors are advised that only the Contracting Officer is legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise obligate the Government.  The US Air Force reserves the right to award sufficient contracts, based on the proposals received, to meet the Government’s needs.

(7) Data Rights:  The Government anticipates and strongly urges unlimited data rights to all data generated under this contract, to include drawings and results.  The contractor is instructed to address data rights assertions, licenses, patents, etc., in the white paper and the formal proposal.

E—BASIS FOR AWARD:

Evaluation Criteria:  White Papers and proposals will be evaluated as to their projected success in achieving the objectives/requirements outlined in Section B--Requirements, of this BAA Special Amendment, utilizing the Factors and Sub-factors below.  Additionally, a risk assessment will be made of the offers, and selections will be made based on the Best Value to the Government.  Awards may be made without discussions.  Factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Although Cost is less important than Technical, it is still considered a significant factor.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   Amendment #1: The due date for this RFQ has been extended to 3:00PM EST, (Friday) May 05, 2006.  All remaining terms and conditions of the RFQ are unchanged.  Please submit your quote to Scott A. Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov, or via fax to 513 487-2107.  Email is the  preferred method for submitting a quote.   This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-06-00118.  The  RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-08.   A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.   The NAICS code is 541710, and the size standard is 500 employees.   STATEMENT OF WORK Dispersion of  Crude Oil and Petroleum Products in Freshwater I.  Period of Performance:   14 months from date of award.  II.  Background and Objectives:  Dispersants are not used to treat oil spills in freshwater in the U.S.  This is partly due to the absence of dispersants that are effective in freshwater on  the NCP Product Schedule and partly due to the perception that dispersion of oil in freshwater would cause unacceptable harm to valuable resources (e.g., public water supplies, endangered species).  In addition, there appears to be a perception that dispersants cannot work in freshwater, but this  may be due (at least in part) to attempts to use dispersants that were optimized for use in seawater.  At least six commercial dispersants have been approved for freshwater use in France. So, it may be possible to optimize dispersant formulations to promote effectiveness in freshwater.  The  environmental consequences of oil-spill dispersion will be determined in part by the dilution potential of the affected water body and partly by the long-term fate of the dispersed oil (e.g., stability of the dispersed oil droplets, biodegradation rate, and tendency to interact with sediments and  other surfaces).  Since several important water bodies (e.g., the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes) have sufficient dilution potential to accommodate dispersion of relatively large oil spills, a blanket prohibition against the use of dispersants in freshwater may be ill advised. Oil dispersants  consist of one or more surfactants dissolved in a compatible solvent.  Surfactants are amphipathic molecules that contain hydrophilic and hydrophobic (or lipophilic) regions that interact with water and oil, respectively.  The presence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic functional groups in the same  molecule causes surfactants to accumulate at the oil-water interface and lower the interfacial tension, which reduces the energy required to create new interfacial area.  For nonionic surfactants, the relative contributions of the hydrophilic and lipophilic regions to the properties of the molecule  can be quantified by the hydrophile:lipophile balance (HLB).  The HLB can vary from 0 (100% lipophilic) to 20 (100% hydrophilic).  Most commercial dispersants have an HLB in the range of 9 to 11 (Clayton et al., 1993).  Dispersants that are optimized for use in seawater tend to have HLBs greater  than 10, but optimal performance in freshwater requires the HLB to be less than 10.  The desired HLB can be obtained using a single surfactant or by mixing two or more surfactants with HLBs lower and higher than the desired average value.  The latter approach is believed to more effective because  it allows closer packing of the surfactant molecules at the oil-water interface (Porter, 1991). The objective of this research is to investigate the relationship between dispersant composition and effectiveness of dispersion of fresh and weathered crude oil in freshwater.  The effectiveness of  several commercial dispersants, that are purported to be effective in freshwater, will be evaluated and compared to mixtures of surfactants with known composition.   III.  Tasks Task 1:  Development of QAPP   Within 15 business days after award, a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) shall be  submitted to the EPA Project Officer (PO) in accordance with EPA's quality assurance guidelines for a basic research project plan (attached). The contractor shall comply with all the requirements as delineated in the section entitled NRMRL's Quality System Specifications on Attachment #1.   Following the review by the EPA PO/QAQC Office, specific comments will be provided to the Contractor.  The contractor shall revise the QAPP in accordance with the changes identified by the PO. Task 2:   Development of Freshwater Dispersants.  The Contractor shall determine the oil-dispersion  effectiveness of surfactant mixtures with a range of HLBs using the EPA's Baffled-Flask Test (BFT) as the standard operating condition (the detailed procedure for the BFT will be provided by the EPA PO). The surfactant mixtures shall consist of combinations of common commercially available  surfactants of the Contractor's choosing. The composition of the surfactant mixture shall be systematically varied to determine the optimal composition.  An important difference between seawater and freshwater is that, in general, the interfacial tension between a specific oil and freshwater is  greater than the interfacial tension between the same oil and seawater.  Therefore, it is important that the Contractor also determine whether the effectiveness of dispersion in freshwater and seawater can be independently predicted by the oil-water interfacial tension (i.e., are the relationships  between dispersion effectiveness and interfacial tension similar in seawater and freshwater or does interfacial tension affect dispersion effectiveness differently depending on the water characteristics?). Specific formulations of artificial seawater and freshwater (1 formulation for each) will be  provided to the Contractor by the EPA PO.  IV.  Reporting Procedures:   The contractor shall provide detailed monthly reports describing progress made in each task. The Contractor shall provide to the EPA PO the raw data as they become available. At the end of the 12 month period, the Contractor  shall summarize all the data developed over the course of the year and deliver its summary to the PO in the form of a draft report or journal article.  The draft report or journal article shall be sent electronically to the PO, in Mirosoft Word format.  The report shall detail the methods used and  the results from all tests performed and provide recommendations for additional work that complement this work.  V.  Deliverables: (1)  Quality Assurance Project Plan submitted to PO within 15 days after award.  (2)  Draft report shall be submitted to the EPA PO NLT 30 days following the end of  the 12-month research period. The PO will review the draft and provide appropriate  comments/changes. Such comments/changes shall be submitted to the EPA PO in a final report, NLT 30 days prior to the end of the order.  (3)  Monthly reports detailing progress. References: Clayton, J.R., Jr., J.R.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. M. Aitkulov, Deputy General Director, National Electrical Grid of Kyrgyzstan JSC, 326, Jibek Jolu, 720070, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, Phone:  +996 (312) 66 10 01, Fax:  +996 (312) 66 06 56 or 66 16 09                         Kyrgyzstan – Southern Kyrgyzstan Transmission Upgrade Feasibility Study Project.  

This announcement serves to inform prospective proposers on the above-referenced project an amendment to the subject Request for Proposals (RFP).

Amendment No. 1:  The following questions have been answered by Deputy General Director S. Saidov concerning the Feasibility Study for the Southern Kyrgyzstan Transmission Upgrade Project.  

QUESTION #1:  In Annex I, Terms of Reference, pg1-1; Are the proposed 500 kV and 220 kVS/S new facilities?  Substations or switching stations. 

ANSWER: We confirm that by “Southern Kyrgyzstan Transmission Upgrade Project” is foreseen construction of new substations 500 kV Datka and 220 kV Kurshab.

QUESTION #2:  In Annex I, Terms of Reference, pg1-1; Are the OH/TL designated as Replacement means that the existing line will be removed and a new line will be placed on the same corridor?  

ANSWER: “Replacement” – means cutting of existing lines and their connection to 500 kV Datka S/S.

QUESTION #3:  In Annex I, Terms of Reference, pg1-1; Are the OH/TL designated as Construction means that the line is new?  

ANSWER: All OH/TL stipulated for construction should be new.

QUESTION #4:  In Annex I, Terms of Reference, pg1-2; Who is going to refine and carry out load flow and short circuit studies?  

ANSWER: The Contractor of Feasibility Studies should execute these works.

QUESTION #5:  Under Task 1A, the RFP states that “the Contractor shall make a site visit to the region and walk the currently proposed line route”.  Does this mean ONE line route? Page 1-1 of the RFP lists 8 line sections totaling 369 km.  Is this practical considering the length of the lines and the fact that access is most likely limited if not impossible?  

ANSWER: The Contractor should pass lines of ALL lines.  Length of all lines is given approximately.

QUESTION  #6:  Under Task 1A, “Condition Assessment”; could you please identify which 220 kV lines will be reconstructed.  

ANSWER: The contractor should estimate the condition of other objects in the territory of the project and prepare the report with recommendations on their reconstruction.

QUESTION #7:  Under Task 2B, “Line Routing Study”, Task 2B; in this task it implies that routing study is for one line 80 km in length.  Could you please elaborate?  

ANSWER: It is necessary to read Task 2B in the following way: “The Contractor shall study earlier prepared options routes of all lines from a viewpoint of energy losses, total cost, schedule implications and other issues”.

QUESTION #8: Under Task 3A, “Feasibility Level design”; could you please elaborate on the Geotechnical Investigation Studies for the transmission line? (a) This is rather unusual at the feasibility level, (b) considering the length of the lines geotechnical investigation will be expensive that the budget allocated for this project doesn’t permit, (c) the rule under EPC type contracts is to specify the specifics of the Geotechnical Investigation and have the Construction Contractor carry out the Geotechnical Investigation develop the foundation designs based on specific guideline and results from the Geotechnical Investigation.  

ANSWER: (a) In the Task 3A indicated scope of geotechnical investigations.  Thus carrying out this subtask does not require geotechnical investigations along the full length of lines. (b) survey profiles are made on detailed mapping datum.  Taking into account the complicated mountainous topography of the land, it is required to choose the safest OH/TL from the point of view of mudflows, sliding, and flooding risk the phenomena influencing cost of objects.  The contractor should execute the requirements of the given Task.

QUESTION #9:  Under Task 3B, “Drawings”; could you please elaborate as to how we are going to prepare Plan and Profile Drawings?  What data is available?  What information are we expected to show on the plan and profile drawings.  If plan and profile drawings are to be generated for all designated lines (369 km) that could be more than 230 drawings.  

ANSWER:  The contractor should execute requirements of the given item.

We would like to inform you that the Kyrgyz institute “Energoproject” executed preliminary investigation of line 500 and 220 kV OH/TL routes and locations 500/220 kV “Datka” S/S (Chief engineer Mr. Leonid Kagansky, Tel. 996-312-510354, Fax 996-312-510356).

AFTAC Seismic Analysis and Reporting Capabilities – 2 (SARC-2)


The Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) has a requirement for Seismic Analysis and Reporting Capabilities –2 (SARC-2) to research and develop software for geophysical data processing.  Effort also includes the sustainment and installation of software for analysis and evaluation of geophysical events at seismic array stations around the world.  Additionally, contractor may be required to provide software training to host-country personnel.  

Description

Analysis and reporting of small magnitude seismic events continues to be one of the most important tasks for the United States National Data Center (USNDC) and the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC).  The operational software system used for analyzing and reporting events in the USNDC is not sufficiently flexible to allow the quick introduction of numerous advanced data processing techniques and the use of various cutting-edge information-presentation technologies.  Lessons learned from several previous special events show that a few key software programs used by the Research Division (TTR) geophysicist are most useful for detailed analyses of small events, and that a user-friendly interface to a specialized reporting database would streamline AFTAC’s reporting process.  

The first objective of this project is to build a suite of software for the analysis and evaluation of geophysical events.  Many of the desired analysis and evaluation techniques have already been incorporated into a research software suite known as Special Event Analysis Tools (SEAtools), developed for the TTR under previous contracts.  This software suite shall be the starting point for this effort.  As part of this effort, new analysis techniques shall be added as they are identified.  In addition, the Contractor shall help identify which portions of SEAtools will eventually have to be “operationalized” in the sense of streamlining and configuring it for optimal routine use with vetted operational settings and previously user-specified input parameters.  In addition to the development of new functionality, included under this objective is the evaluation of Government Off-the Shelf (GOTS) and Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) algorithms/techniques, as applicable, for the improvement of geophysical data processing capabilities.

The second objective is to continue the development and maintenance of an event reporting tool that will extract information from AFTAC databases, and use such information to generate graphic and alphanumeric event summaries for presentation to AFTAC’s various customers via a “web-page” hosted on a classified internet Wide-Area-Network.

The third objective is to provide for installation of the SARC software suite at seismic array stations around the world for use in analyzing and evaluating geophysical events.

The fourth objective is to provide for maintenance of the software suite.  The contractor shall be responsible for traveling to foreign seismic array stations to install the SARC software and to train the host-country personnel how to use the software.  Contractor personnel will require DoD security clearances at least at the TOP SECRET/SCI level for key personnel.  Handling of material up to a TOP SECRET/SCI is required.  TOP SECRET Facility Clearnace is required.  Storage Clearances of at least the SECRET level are required.

The contractor shall possess an in-depth understanding of the requirements listed above.  Ideal contractor candidates must have personnel with knowledge of Seismic Analysis and Reporting Capabilities (SARC) to research and develop software for geophysical data processing.  Contractor experience and past performance are critical to a successful and uninterrupted SARC mission; therefore, a history of relevant work is required.  Experience in assessment and development of concept requirements and operational documentation is required.  Also, experience in performing software validation and testing in above AFTAC/TT mission area outlined above is required.

Capabilities Package

This sources-sought synopsis is an invitation for all qualified small business sources that contemplate submitting a proposal under a future RFP for this requirement to identify themselves.  Sources should submit a brief capabilities statement in response to this notice.  Responses must be limited to no more than 20 pages and should address the following specific areas:
1.	The clearance level of personnel working on the proposed contract.
2.	The capabilities of key personnel relating to the requirements outlined above.  Resumes may be included but shall be counted as part of the above page limit.
3.	Recent and Relevant company experience and capabilities related to the requirements outlined above.
4.	Business size/status.
The government intends to make a single award and trade off performance over price.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract is contemplated with a 1-year base period and 4 one-year options (1 Oct 2006 – 30 Sep 2011).  This sources sought is for planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to pay for information requested, issue a solicitation, or award a contract.  Applicable NAICS is 541511, size $21M.  The solicitation may be issued electronically on or about 10 May 2006 at www.fbo.gov.    Anticipated award date will be on or around 30 Sep 2006.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command, Aircraft Division, is seeking vendors to provide options on how best to meet the EC-130J Airborne Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) 10 kilowatt TV analog broadcast mission.  The Government is interested in extending the capability to support broadcast of a digital TV mission.  The modulation type of the digital TV mission would be at a minimum DVB-T (COFDM modulation) and possibly also ATSC (8VSB or Enhanced 8VSB digital modulation).   NAVAIR would seek a replacement to the TV driver function which would/could allow the conventional Rhode-Schwartz analog TV modulator to be swapped with a digital DVB-T TV modulator or a digital ATSC modulator.  The on-ground reception range of the digital TV broadcast must be comparable to the current analog system reception range.

Existing TV broadcast antennas must be retained in any potential solution.

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool being used to determine the best value solution for partial replacement, complete replacement, or enhancement of the existing TV-8022 mission system.  All interested parties are encouraged to respond with recommendations and capability statements.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.  The Government is not obligated in any way to award a contract based on information received from potential sources.

CURRENT SYSTEM:

The current TV-8022 driver function is essentially the initial 300 to 500 watt RF amplification stage that accepts input from the conventional Rhode-Schwartz TV analog modulator (exciter).

The TV-8022 High Power Amplifier (HPA) has a TV channel tuning band of basically channel 2 thru TV channel 69 worldwide.  It is composed of three high power amplifier cavities: (1) a 47-88 MHz cavity which amplifies  a nominal 350 watt low-level diplexed input drive signal to the full rated 10 KW peak sync video output power which consists of a single tube stage with a manually tuned plate load impedance matching network; tuning is accomplished using front panel controls and by physically adding or removing tube cavity straps, (2) a 170 to 230 MHz cavity which amplifies the nominal 350 watt diplexed input drive signal to the full rated 10 KW peak sync video output power which consists of a single tube stage; the VHFH cavity is identical in operation to the VHFL cavity except that tuning is accomplished completely by front panel controls, and (3) a 470 to 860 MHz frequency range cavity which amplifies a nominal 350 watt low-level diplexed input drive signal to the full rated 10 KW peak sync video output power.  This UHF amplifier is a single tube stage with a manually tuned plate load impedance matching network with tuning accomplished by removing the UHF cavity compartment covers and moving tuning slides, by physically adding or removing fixed capacitance to the cavity anode plate circuit when changing frequency from a low/mid UHF channel (470-650MHz) to a high UHF channel (642-1000MHz).
 
The TV-8022 HPA is manually tuned to provide a nominal 14.5 dB of gain across its tuning range and still allow the required channel bandwidths (6 to 8 MHz) for worldwide TV standards and must provide amplifier class A linearity to meet intermodulation and spurious requirements..
 
The 14.5 dB gain in RF power (input to output ratio of approximately 1 to 28) does not always apply to the UHF cavity which often achieves ONLY a 13 dB gain (factor of 1 to 20) after being maximum gain tuned.
 
The TV-8022 is designed with input (level) and output (VSWR) protection that necessitates an external Automatic Gain Control (AGC) active at the low-level exciter and/or driver stages to affect overall wideband system gain for changing environmental conditions (cabin pressure, temperature, etc.).
 
The system currently employs AGC RF coupling from the TV-8022 output back to the level detection circuitry of the Rhode-Schwartz TV Modulator (exciter).  The detected level is used to increase or decrease the low-level IF output of the modulator as necessary to maintain the desired final output which in the current system is normally 10 KW peak of sync.

REQUIREMENTS:

If recommending modification of the existing TV-8022 system, the TV driver must

A.	Provide a wideband (6 – 8 MHz) VHF or UHF TV channel output across the channel range of channel 2 through channel 69 (basically 50 thru 860 MHz) at a nominal RF power level from 300 to 500 Watts peak of sync as determined by the final amplifiers gain characteristic and AGC,

B.	Have an output with NO induced distortions (Class A linear) and meet or exceed the TV-8022 requirement for intermodulation distortions, spurious products and harmonics, and 

C.	Have RF input and output impedances for a matched RF 50 ohm standard with the output ability to load into a maximum mismatch of 2:1 (tuned input of TV-8022 is a nominal 1.5:1 or better).


SUBMITTAL INFORMATION

It is requested that all interested sources submit to the contracting office, a brief recommendation(s) and capabilities statement package (no more than 20 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum) demonstrating why the recommendation(s) results in the best value to the government, and vendor’s ability to provide the recommended solution(s).

<DESC>The Department of Education intends to make an award to an 8(a) company. This is a five year contract (09/30/06 to 09/29/11). Interested vendors can call Vidya Vish at 202-245-6167 or email Vidya.vish@ed.gov.  Please submit your capability Statements     electronically by 12 P.M on Thursday, May 11, 2006.

The purpose of the study is:

The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) within the Institute of Education Sciences of the U.S. Department of Education has the following mission: (1) to collect and analyze education information and statistics in a manner that meets the highest methodological standards; (2) to report education information and statistics in a timely manner; and (3) to collect, analyze, and report education information and statistics in a manner that (A) is objective, secular, neutral, and non-ideological and is free of partisan political influence and racial, cultural, gender, or regional bias; and (B) is relevant and useful to practitioners, researchers, policymakers, and the public.

NCES collects statistics on the condition of education in the United States, analyzes and reports the meaning and significance of these statistics, and assists states, local education agencies, and postsecondary institutions in improving their statistical systems. NCES supports a wide range of activities, providing policy-relevant data on issues as diverse as enrollment trends, access of minorities to postsecondary education, the academic achievement of students, comparisons of the U.S. education system with education systems in other countries, and the association between education and economic productivity.

The Decennial Census School District 2000 Project provides NCES with a vehicle for identifying special data tabulations containing aggregated data describing attributes of children, families, and households in each school district in the Nation.  This project brings together school district geographic boundaries as obtained through a Department of Education sponsored survey of state liaisons on school district geography (funded through the Title 1 Program) with the census data.  Paper and digitized maps developed by the individual states are sent to the Census Bureau; the Census Bureau transforms this information to a TIGER/Line file format as a means to tabulate address-oriented data.  Once mapped, census blocks are uniquely associated with their respective school districts.  Census tabulation blocks are then aggregated to provide estimates for school districts, counties, states, and the U.S. using both long and short form data.  The data are tabulated for different types of school districts (elementary, secondary, unified), various age categories of children, and households and families.  Virtually, all long and short form data elements are used for these special tabulations.

The use of the Decennial Census for statistical and programmatic projects at the National Center for Education Statistics dates from the early 1970's.  Census data have provided the agency an opportunity to present detailed demographic, social, and economic data tabulated at the school district level.  Such data, as provided by the long and short form of the census, have given the agency, state and local education policy analysts, and education research analysts a once in a decade snapshot of the economic and social demography of individual public school districts across the Nation.

This RFP defines the support for the Department of Education's NCES in maintenance, upgrade, update software and revise the   NCES School District Demographic System, an interactive Mapping Online System, for 2000 Decennial Census School District Demographics System. This school district mapping system will provide NCES data users and the public geographical visualization capabilities to analyze demographic, socio-economic, and other NCES data.

<DESC>The US Army Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC) on behalf of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) Communications and Electronics Research, De velopment and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Ground Combat Systems Division, Robotic, Urban and Ground Sensors Branch is seeking information on the availability of existing systems suitable for use in the following concept of operation and the level of development effort required to meet the capabilities described herein. Concept of Operation: The system will provide the Department of Defense (DoD) with an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), semi-autonomous, all weather, sample collection platform for use in areas contaminated by radiation. The UGV system will provide the operat or a safe stand-off range (5-10 miles) by operating beyond line of sight where it will perform collection and reconnaissance tasks. The UGV is expected to operate in urban and non-urban environments.  The UGV system will use a modular configuration capable  of employing various sample collection and detection/identification systems. The system must be inherently simple to use, survivable, durable, multi-functional, and easily transportable. The system is composed of the UGV platform and an associated Ground Control Station (GCS).  The capabilities for each of these are described below: Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV):  Mobility: - UGV is envisioned to have the capability to traverse improved surfaces at high speed during ingress and egress of the target area. - UGV should be capable of operating at speeds up to 30kph. - The UGV is also expected to encounter unknown terrain and therefore must be capable of traversing off-road terrain, rubble resulting from the damage or destruction of buildings and other structures, and some level of water and mud. - The UGV should be capable of moving (not lifting) debris or an object weighing 100 lbs. Autonomy: -UGV should have teleoperation capability. -UGV should possess semi-autonomous mobility capability with inherent all terrain obstacle detection and avoidance. -The semi-autonomous capabilities should aid the operator in teleoperation. Communications: -UGV should have tactical data links that support bi-directional communication line-of-sight (LOS) and beyond LOS back to the UGV GCS.  The data links must perform in urban and non-urban environments. The type of information transmitted should include but is not limited to data, telemetry, video and platform commands. The latency of this information must not impair the operators ability to control the vehicle. Payload: - UGV should have autonomous radiological search capability. - UGV is to have a manipulator arm with the ability to collect samples from a variety of locations around the vehicle. - UGV manipulator should possess a minimum of 5 degrees of freedom. - The desired samples consist of debris, vacuum, and swipe samples.  The UGV is to have the ability to collect and store at least 5 samples of each type (debris, vacuum, swipe). - UGV manipulator arm should be capable of lifting 70lbs. - It is envisioned that this manipulator arm will have some autonomous capabilities such as pre-programmed poses, user defined poses, automatic placement in storage containers, automatic tool changes, etc. to aide the operator. - UGV is to have a means of verifying radiological content of the samples. Mission: - UGV is expected to conduct extended missions with a length up to 24 hours (refueling time included with periodic re-supply). - UGV is to be hardened to withstand the intended environment, which includes radiation contamination. - UGV must have the ability to be decontaminated and design considerations should be made to ease this process. - UGV should be capable of collecting and transporting at minimum - 5 debris, 2 kg each - 5 vacuum samples, 0.25 kg each - 5 swipe samples - UGV should be capable of transporting 200 lbs. of collected cargo in a cargo hold or on a trailer. - UGV must be readily transportable by both military and commercial means. To minimize response time, both air and ground transportation will be necessary. Ground Control Station (GCS): The GCS must incorporate open software architecture for future UGV support. The GCS is to be a complete command and control (C2) suite that incorporates all relevant DoD standards. The GCS should be capable of mission planning , executing, monitoring, and dynamic re-tasking and communicating with the UGV.  The GCS should have the ability to control at least two UGVs.  It should also have an open systems architecture that can interoperate with external devices such as printers, d rives, video recording equipment, etc. Human factors engineering considerations should be taken into account due to the extended mission duration. The GCS must also import and interpret a variety of data from external sources to include digitized geographi c/mapping data.  The GCS should have the ability to store data locally and transmit or receive data from a higher echelon.  The GCS should be capable of monitoring all UGV telemetry data including but not limited to fuel level and any warning or caution si gnals. Sources possessing the capabilities to satisfy these requirements are invited to submit a white paper, up to twenty-five (25) pages, describing their system or proposed system. The white paper shall include as a minimum: 1. A description of the system or proposed system, that clearly identifies where Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Non-Developmental Items (NDI) will be utilized. 2. Cost and schedule estimates for an initial prototype system and 15 additional systems. It is requested the cost estimates at a minimum be broken down into the following categories of which requirements are described above: a.  Robotic Platform b.  Autonomy  i.  Tele-operation ii. Semi- Autonomous Mobility c.  Communications d.  Robotic Payload e.  Ground Control Station 3.  Past Performance on relevant work in the past 5 years. This is NOT a request for proposal.  This Request for Information is not construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for any information solicited.

<SUBJECT>99--SEEKING OFFERS TO ENGAGE AMERICANS THROUGH EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION
<DESC>Statement of Purpose For nearly 50 years, NASA’s journeys into air and space have deepened humankind’s understanding of the universe, advanced technology breakthroughs, enhanced air travel safety and security, and expanded the frontiers of scientific research.  These accomplishments share a common genesis: education. NASA will continue the Agency’s tradition of strengthening the Nation’s education programs and supporting the country’s educators who play a key role in preparing, inspiring, exciting, encouraging, and nurturing the young minds of today who will manage and lead the Nation’s laboratories and research centers of tomorrow. In 2006 and beyond, NASA will continue to pursue three major education goals: •	Strengthen NASA and the Nation’s future workforce:  NASA will identify and develop the critical skills and capabilities needed to achieve the Vision for Space Exploration.  To help meet this demand, NASA will continue contributing to the development of the Nation’s science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce of the future through a diverse portfolio of education initiatives that target America’s students at all levels, especially those in traditionally underserved and underrepresented communities. •	Attract and retain students in STEM disciplines:  To compete effectively for the minds, imaginations, and career ambitions of America’s young people, NASA will focus on engaging and retaining students in STEM education programs to encourage their pursuit of educational disciplines critical to NASA’s future engineering, scientific, and technical missions. •	Engage Americans in NASA’s mission:  NASA will build strategic partnerships and linkages between STEM formal and informal education providers. Through hands-on, interactive, educational activities, NASA will engage students, educators, families, the general public, and all Agency stakeholders to increase Americans’ science and technology literacy. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration seeks one or more unfunded collaborations with organizations that would enhance NASA’s ability to achieve its educational goals.  Specifically, NASA seeks proposals for creating and managing innovative activities, events, products, services, or other types of formal or informal education methods for the purpose of disseminating information nationally about NASA’s projects and programs.  NASA will enter into as many qualified collaborations as possible, without limiting the types or categories of activities, events, products or services considered.  However, if multiple offers are received in one particular category or type, NASA may need to select only one offer per category for a specific time period (defined as “limited exclusivity”).  It is intended that this request for entrepreneurial offers will result in the establishment of one or more non-reimbursable Space Act Agreements that will define the full roles and responsibilities of NASA and the proposing organization(s).  Benefits to Corporate Partner In exchange for a collaborator’s investment to create and implement a means to creatively disseminate NASA information, NASA will consider negotiating brand placement, limited exclusivity (defined above) and other opportunities as part of a strategic collaboration. Consideration only will be given to those offers that are commensurate with the value of the above, and that reflect NASA mission, values and goals.   NASA Requirements and Evaluation Criteria NASA is looking for a collaborator to deliver the following: All proposals must demonstrate the following threshold requirements to be considered:  •	The activities, events, products, services, or other types of education opportunities must be available nationally. •	Proposals must include opportunities to “inspire, engage, educate or employ” the stated audiences.  o	Inspire—Activities focused on promoting awareness of NASA’s mission among the public, primarily through informal education and outreach activities.  Inspire level efforts are broad, with the goal of reaching a large number of people, but are not limited to “in-person.” This category forms the base of an education structure that becomes more focused at progressively higher levels of the framework. o	Engage—Education activities that in some manner incorporate participant interaction with NASA content for the purpose of developing a deeper understanding. Participants are strategically identified and targeted.  o	Educate—Focused education support that promotes learning among targeted populations. Education activities focus on student learners, or pre- and in-service educators, and are designed to develop and/or enhance specific STEM knowledge and skills using NASA resources. Educate activities promote new knowledge acquisition and strengthen an individual’s skills. NASA’s elementary and secondary education efforts are supplementary to formal classroom instruction. NASA’s higher education efforts may include development of specific university curricula in support of the NASA mission.  o	Employ—Targeted development of individuals who prepare for employment in disciplines needed to achieve NASA’s mission and strategic goals. Through internships, fellowships, and other professional training, individuals become participants in the Vision for Space Exploration and NASA science and aeronautics research. At the apex, they have acquired sufficient mastery of knowledge for employment with NASA, academia, industry, or within STEM fields of teaching. •	Significant experience in successful design and implementation of the proposed method of engaging the target audience. •	Ability to measure success of the proposed activity. Evaluation Criteria Overview:  Offers will be evaluated on the capabilities to provide the proposed method, the viability of the organization, the level of the team’s experience, the documented experience and success in the proposed method. All proposals will be evaluated on the documented success of the organization in the following areas: Technical Ability and Experience: 1.	Ability to create and manage the proposed method of engaging the target audience. 2.	Documented metrics on the demographics and popularity of the proposed method. 3.	Documentation on the success of the proposed method in reaching the target audience effectively, and other results-oriented documentation. 4.	As appropriate, documented success on delivering a campaign through various media, including print, radio, television and the Internet, to inform about missions and recent accomplishments, and to facilitate encouragement of young Americans to enter scientific, mathematical and engineering fields.  5.	Evidence of the proposer’s experience and expertise in the development of educational programs, projects, products or activities. Management ability: 1.	Ability to schedule and meet realistic milestones.   2.	Management team experience (include information on location, points of contact and top-level organizational structure.) 3.	Projected schedule and milestones for accomplishing project. Financial Stability: 1.	Strength of market analysis and strategy analysis. 2.	Strength of financial plan and evidence of financial stability (include annual audits, balance sheets and appropriate documentation.) Other: 1.	Level of NASA assets and resources, such as the NASA identity, people, content and facilities, requested for the collaboration. 2.	Level of prestige of the organization, company and/or other government agency represented, and how its strategy, mission statement, values and goals reflect NASA’s. 3.	Level of additional value and benefits offered to NASA. Additionally, the proposal and the proposed method must be consistent with applicable NASA statutes, policies, and regulations.

<SUBJECT>--Software Technologies targeting Interoperability for Systems of Systems
<DESC>Interoperability and the management of complexity are chief challenges to harness in meeting the DoDs future needs for its information and control infrastructure.   The US Army Research Laboratory is focused on these needs for future Army technology .  For example, the Armys Future Combat System (FCS) will be a joint architecture made up of 18 individual systems plus the network and Soldier.  It will be an ensemble of manned and unmanned systems designed to provide a multi-functional, multi-mission r econfigurable system of systems.  FCS will bring together a multitude of components within each individual system and require interoperability amongst the major systems.  Software is the necessary component which will tie together all the pieces as well as  guarantee nonfunctional system attributes such as adaptability, dependability, flexibility and agility.  The difficulties of real world networking and communications will also provide great challenges to assure and secure the information flow.  FCS and ot her future DoD systems will still be required to interface and integrate with legacy systems and provide methodology for integrating future functional enhancements. U.S. Army Research Laboratory is currently seeking proposals through its Broad Agency Announcement DAAD19-03-R-0017, Topic 1.15 found at http://www.arl.army.mil/main/main/ to develop and transition new methodologies, tools, technologies and techniques that  improve the quality, dependability and interoperability of software for large, net-centric system of systems.  Key in this effort is to develop and establish principles of interoperability and complexity management as a foundation for developing a service -oriented architecture for these ultra large scale systems.   These principles will enable the precise description of components, their construction and their acceptable interactions (e.g., to enforce performance and security requirements), leading to new approaches for building and assembling systems. Research Concentration Areas:  In order to address these challenges, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) under the auspices of the OSD Software-Intensive Systems Producibility Initiative (SISPI) is soliciting proposals in the following areas. They are suggestive of topic areas which will enable future DoD systems to move towards net-centric environments.  They are not in priority order and are meant to stimulate ideas for prospective proposals.  Other novel and creative solutions are strongly encouraged .   a.	Domain-specific modeling languages and semantics b.	Model-based design and development/engineering for system of systems architectures and ultra large scale software intensive architectures. c.	Models which support reflective (self-referential) capability d.	Principles and ontology development for organization of components, their design and construction  e.	Verifiably correct generators and models f.	Re-engineering and Integration technologies (methods, tools, metrics, models, etc.) for legacy systems Proposals must show and will be expected to deliver a functional model package which will include usable software methodologies, models archetypes, and/or tools which can be tested and incorporated into DoD R&D programs.  The Software and Systems Test Trac k (managed by the Air Force Research Laboratory), another component of the OSD SISPI will provide an open framework environment where tools and products may be deployed and allowed to interact in real-time, interactive, evolutionary and interdependent mean s, allowing rigorous testing of new technologies, methodologies and theories in support of the OSD Software-Intensive Systems Producibility Initiative.   While Topic 1.15 will remain open throughout the period covered by BAA DAAD19-03-R-0017, funding is currently available under this topic for up to THREE awards.  Cooperative agreements, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2358, are anticipated to be awarded f or a period of three yea rs, to include a one year basic period of performance and two one year options.  The funding level for these awards is not to exceed $700,000/year for all awards.  It is anticipated that award(s) will be made to academic institutions; however proposals may  include performance by other than academic institutions, so long as such institutions are willing to perform under a cooperative agreement.  To be considered for this years funding, white papers in accordance with PART IV - Section 3 of the ARL BAA must be received by 25 May 2006.  Papers must be submitted in no smaller than 12 point font and may not exceed 5 pages double-spaced.  In approximately 2-3 weeks after receipt of white papers, offerors submitting proposals of interest to ARL will receive an inv itation to submit a complete proposal in accordance with PART IV - Section 4 of the ARL BAA.

Instructions to Offerors-Commercial (JAN 2005) The offeror must complete the annual representations and certifications electronically via the ORCA website at http://orca.bpn.gov. After reviewing the ORCA database information, the offeror verifies by submission of this offer that the representations and certifications currently posted electronically at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, have been entered or updated in the last 12 months, are current, accurate, complete, and applicable to this solicitation (including business size standard applicable to the NAICS code referenced for this solicitation), as of the date of this offer and are incorporated in this offer by reference (see FAR 4.1201); FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items As prescribed in 12.301 (c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows: EVALUATION—COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
<BR><BR>
C.  Teaming/Subcontracting Relationships.  If an Offeror’s quote includes Teaming Partners or Subcontractors, then the Offeror is required to supply to the Government, along with its quote, a copy of the Teaming Arrangement or other document that identifies which partner/subcontractor shall be responsible for performing which requirements.
<BR><BR>
The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
<BR><BR>
1.  Past Performance and Experience.  The Government will evaluate offeror’s past performance and experience to determine whether the vendor consistently delivers quality products and services in a timely manner.  This factor will be evaluated on the basis of relevant past performance and experience for each offeror. <BR><BR>
Each quote is required to describe a minimum of three but not more than five prior relevant projects that the offeror has completed or are ongoing which are similar in scope and size to this requirement.  Include points of contact and their phone numbers, and titles, size of procurement in dollar value and e-mail addresses if possible.  Each reference shall include a contracting and technical point of contact.  
If the offeror’s quote includes teaming partners or subcontractors, then the information above required of the offeror on three to five relevant projects shall be similarly required of each teaming partner/subcontractor. 
If the offeror’s quote includes teaming partners or subcontractors, then the Government shall evaluate each partner’s/subcontractor’s individual past performance and experience and average the evaluations together for an overall Team past performance and experience evaluation.  In evaluating a teaming partner’s or subcontractor’s past performance in a particular type of work, the Government may consider whether the teaming partner whose past performance or experience is touted will be performing that work, as evidenced by the terms of the quote and the Teaming Arrangement or other document provided per paragraph C above.<BR><BR>
The information presented in the vendor’s quote, together with information from any other sources available to the Government (i.e., Government-controlled Contractor performance databases, Inspector General reports, General Accounting Office reports, newspaper articles, references including contractual and end-user representatives, etc.) will provide the input for evaluation of this factor.  The past performance and experience information should include the vendor’s record of providing high quality services in a timely manner, standards of good workmanship, adhering to contract schedules, administrative aspects of contract performance, overall quality of assigned personnel, availability, stability, reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to and business-like concern for the interests of the customer, quality of overall program management approach, record of awards or performance recognition earned, and overall client satisfaction.  Past performance and experience that is relevant to this requirement will be of more value than non-relevant past performance and experience.  Offerors will be evaluated on examples of past performance and experience wherein the experience of the vendor has contributed to the success of similar contracts/task orders.  Offerors will be evaluated on examples of past performance and experience wherein the infrastructure and resources of the vendor contributed to the success of similar contracts/task orders.  A lack of relevant past performance and experience data will be treated by the Government as a neutral evaluation.  Past performance and experience will be evaluated to determine contractor’s suitability for meeting the objectives of the requirement.  
<BR><BR>
2. The Offer’s price quote will be evaluated for reasonableness. 
<BR><BR>
This is a best value procurement.  Past performance and experience is more important than price.  
<BR><BR>
In the event one contractor cannot provide the full coverage in all locations, multiple awards may be considered by the government.
<BR><BR>
A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items As prescribed in 12.301(b)(2), insert the following provision: OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS—COMMERCIAL ITEMS (MAR 2005)
<BR><BR>

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for one Ultraviolet Intensified CCD Digital Camera System. The requirements for this camera system are as follows: A.	The UV camera system detector unit must have a minimum focal plane array (FPA) resolution of 1024 x 1024 pixels with 13.5 micron pixel size. The image intensifier must have spectral responsivity between 120 nm and 850 nm, a minimum gating period of 2 ns, and a spatial resolution of at least 45 line pairs per mm. The intensifier must be fiber-coupled to the CCD. The quantum efficiency of the intensifier at wavelengths shorter than 500 nm must be at least 10%. Intensified CCD detectors with less resolution and spectral bandwidth are unacceptable as they will limit our ability to capture the full spatial and spectral coverage available with our spectrograph. The camera head must be sealed with no gas purge required. B.	The UV camera system controller must have a programmable timing generator with the following features; a.	Direct control of gate width and delay, with the ability to store multiple settings in memory; b.	TTL level output of applied gate pulse derived directly from the high voltage gate; c.	Adjustable trigger polarity, threshold, and impedance; d.	Trigger insertion delay of less than 25 ns; e.	Trigger echo and a user-adjustable delayed trigger output; f.	Pulse counting capability; g.	On-chip accumulation control; C.	The UV camera system controller must have digitizer speeds up to 1 MHz. The controller must support USB 2.0. The controller must also supply programmable TTL outputs through software; D.	The UV camera system detector unit must support Nikon F-mount lenses and attachment to an Acton Research Corporation SpectraPro spectrograph; E.	The UV camera system control software must support simultaneous acquisition from multiple Princeton Instruments PI-MAX cameras on one computer. Our instrumentation suite employs multiple existing PI-MAX cameras, and the ability to synchronize the UV camera with these other cameras is required. Integration of multiple cameras must be accomplished through stand-alone software or through Labview. The control software must access all intensifier gain, timing, averaging, and pixel binning parameters of each camera. Camera configuration parameters must be stored in the image file of each acquired image. Detector head and controller performance minimum requirements;  1.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Rand Machine Products, Inc., 2072 Allen St. Ext., Falconer NY 14733-0072.  Rand Machine Products, Inc. is the only source with a proven record of providing high-quality specimens with consistent characteristics, in a timely manner, that enable repeatable, consistent quality test results.  For 5 years the Damage Mechanisms Branch has been developing a new steel for the fabrication of kinetic energy penetrators in conjunction with conducting penetration research that requires high quality, repeatable, reproducible machining of Research and Development test items.  During the development of this steel, general tests have been performed to characterize the material properties of this steel for various weapon program requirements.  To perform these tests, material coupons have to be fabricated from the steel that will meet tight geometrical tolerances.  Additionally, the material coupons must have minimal or no surface defects in order to receive quality data that meets the program requirements.  Any variation in the surface finish, machining methods, or processing could have detrimental results on data comparisons.  For the last 2 years, the Damage Mechanisms Branch has also been conducting in-house research for Sand/Soil Stability of kinetic penetrators.  The penetrators fabricated for this effort must be of high quality, repeatable, reproducible machining in order to ensure that we are measuring the performance of the penetrators and not of potential machining defects/anomalies.  The Damage Mechanisms Branch has been using Rand Machining for this research effort. Market research indicates that Rand Machine is the only source with a proven record of providing high-quality specimens with consistent characteristics, in a timely manner, that enable repeatable, consistent quality test results.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract with a maximum ceiling of $4.9M over a 5-yr period with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.301-1.  NAICS code is 332999 with size standard of 500.  All responsible sources may submit an offer. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Routine or administrative questions should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Program Manager.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  Potential offerors are invited to contact AFRL/MN’s Ombudsman, Colonel Jeffrey Schmidt (937) 904-9700, with serious concerns only.  For technical information contact Tom Brantley, AFRL/MNMW at (850) 882-7998, for contractual questions contact Christi O’Leary, Contracts Specialist at (850) 882-2678.  Numbered Notes 22 and 26 apply.

Contract performance will primarily take place near the Persian Gulf AND near the Horn of Africa.  The contractor shall maintain or have available a minimum capacity for storage, handling and protection of food aid commodities totaling 10,000 net metric tons.  The government may elect to have the contractor store and handle food aid commodities up to a maximum of 30,000 net metric tons.  The government shall declare options in net metric ton storage requirements at least 15 days prior to arrival of commodities.  In the event the government increases the storage requirement, the contractor shall indicate their agreement to the government.  If required, the contractor shall submit an amended operational plan to the government for approval.  Such plan shall be submitted no later than seven days after government notice of increased minimum requirements.
The contractor shall take delivery (possession) of USAID food aid commodities at the foreign port, provide transport to the contractor's warehouse facility, store and control the food commodities and re-deliver commodities on a F.o.B. warehouse door or on a f.a.s vessel basis, to organizations designated by USAID.  (No forwarding or logistic services are required in the United States.)  The government shall issue a fixed rate contract for these commercial commodity warehouse services.
The contractor shall take possession of food aid cargo (containerized, bagged, on pallets or in cartons - whole grains and/or processed corn, wheat and/or soybean products, refined vegetable oils) at the local port area (containerized, ex tackle and / or at the end of a bagging line) and deliver the commodities to contractor's warehouse for storage, protection and subsequent re-delivery.  The contractor shall store commodities in a manner which ensures ease of access, inspection and fumigation.  The contractor shall preserve the condition of commodities and will follow USAID (FFP Commodity Reference Guide) guidelines and best commercial practices in storing and maintaining food commodities.  The contractor shall maintain the warehouse in a sound, clean condition and take all reasonable steps to keep it free of insects, rodents, birds and other conditions which may adversely affect the condition of the commodities or their containers.  Commodities shall be stored in the warehouse in such a manner that lot identity is maintained to the extent that, when delivery of any lot is ordered by USAID, the specific commodities received will be re-delivered.  Contractor shall coordinate receipt, possession and re-delivery of cargo with vessel owners, port officials, non-governmental organizations and custom officials.  Contractor is responsible for obtaining and/or generating all documentation relating to acceptance of possession of cargo, as well as any documentation associated with re-delivery/re-export of commodities to USAID-designated consignees or transported to other destinations.  Contractor shall assure customs duty-free possession of commodities and transfer of title to consignees.  Title to cargo shall remain with USAID, or other party designated by USAID, until title is transferred to the USAID/FFP designated organization (a PVO, NGO or cooperating sponsor).
The contractor shall provide commodity receiving, handling, port-to-warehouse inland transportation, warehousing, inventory control, accountability, and container stuffing / loading or re-delivery services for USAID sponsored pre-positioned humanitarian aid cargoes under this contract.  Cargo shall generally consist of agricultural products bagged in 25 kg. or 50 kg. multi-walled polypropylene or paper bags.  Cargo may also include vegetable oil in 5-gallon pails or similar containers.  The initial minimum warehouse requirement is 10,000 net metric tons.  The warehouse shall be suitable for off-the-ground storage of food and it shall comply with all local safety and fire regulations.  The contractor and its agents shall provide USAID with a copy of any insurance certificates covering personnel and the facility against liability, loss or damage, theft or fire during the term of this contract.
If arriving cargo is containerized, the contractor will strip containers at the port area or will truck containers to its warehouse, strip the containers and return the empty containers back to the carrier's yard in the port area.  Container free time will be as per carrier tariff.  Any charges due to contractor exceeding allowable container free time shall be for the account of the contractor.

USAID will advise the contractor of vessel daily bagging rate without guarantee.  Any unreasonable delay caused by contractor's inability to take away commodities from the end of the bagging line or the vessel's f.a.s. position, which results in vessel's claim for detention, will be for the account of the contractor; or 2) (if available) receive and store bulk commodities, to be bagged or re-delivered as directed at a later time.
The contractor will provide written reports including but not limited to in-bound receiving reports, over / short / loss / damage / wet / torn or slack reports, out-bound shipping or delivery reports and on-demand snapshot inventory in stock status reports.  All reports must reference the commodity Notice to Deliver numbers as assigned by the U.S. Department of Agriculture or USAID.
The contractor will re-deliver the bagged or palletized commodities on a warehouse door F.o.B. basis or to a f.a.s. position under ships hook as directed by the contracting officer or USAID Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO).  USAID will advise contractor of vessels receiving capability without guarantee.  Any delay caused by contractor's inability to place commodities in a f.a.s. position, which results in vessels claim for detention or dead freight, will be for the account of the contractor.  Alternatively, USAID will advise the contractor of PVO / NGO receiving capability without guarantee.  Any claims for detention or dead freight will be settled in accordance with FAR 52.233 - 1, "Disputes" if a claim is filed after final payment to the contractor.  If a claim is filed and settled prior to final payment, such amounts may be deducted from payment.
Fumigation:  The contractor shall arrange and pay for independent condition inspections for any pre-positioned bagged food commodities in place on the warehouse floor more than 30 days or if 30 days have passed since the last inspection.  The contractor shall also arrange and pay for condition inspections for any cargo five days prior to re-delivery or container stuffing.  These condition inspections shall be completed in accordance with the U.S. Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) condition inspection guidelines.  If condition inspectors find infested commodities, the contractor shall arrange and pay for fumigation of any lots found to be infested.  Fumigation is to be done in accordance with the FGIS fumigation handbook (http://archive.gipsa.usda.gov/reference-library/handbooks/fumigation/fumhb.pdf).
