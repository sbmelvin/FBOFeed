<SUBJECT>Acquisition of an Illumina NextSeq 500 and associated ancillary hardware and software 
<SOLNBR>69538
<RESPDATE>062314
<CONTACT>Leslie D. Jones, Phone 7704882042, Email jxy6@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID), intends to award a sole source contract to Illumina, Inc. 9885 Town Centre Drive, San Diego, CA 92121 for the acquisition of Illumina NextSeq 500 and associated ancillary hardware and software for high throughput sequencing of enteric disease isolates.
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is 12 months.</p>
<p>The Illumina NextSeq 500 will be used for enteric disease laboratory investigations in NCEZID using next generation sequencing. The Enterics Disease Laboratory Branch (EDLB) has performed classic biochemical, phenotypic, and gel-electrophoresis based testing to characterize isolate samples. The advent of next-generation whole-genome sequencing has made rapid, inexpensive and accurate whole genome sequencing of bacterial isolates in real time a possibility. This method provides far greater resolution than any existing biochemical, phenotypic, or gel-based test, as well as comparable data across samples separated by time and geography. Next generation sequencing enables the simultaneous capture of information about variation, virulence, antibiotic resistance, and origin. Following the successful deployment of this approach on listeria isolate samples, EDLB seeks to expand next-generation sequencing to other enteric disease isolates. This requires the use of high-throughput, user-friendly sequencing devices capable of sequencing several hundred samples in a week. The only sequencer that provides this level of throughput, ease of use, sequencing efficiency, and sequencing accuracy is the Illumina NextSeq 500.</p>
<p>When compared to other next-generation sequencers, the Illumina NextSeq 500 is unique in that it offers high throughput and a high degree of sequencing accuracy at low cost. Additionally, its high rate of image capture and independent lane fluidics allow the capture of a large quanitity of long base pair reads in 24 hours. The NextSeq 500 also offers a flexible and easy to use interface and self-contained reagent cartridge format that minimizes contamination and increases ease of use. Finally, it offers support for up to 96 index barcodes allows for more samples to be run on than on other comparable sequencers.</p>
<p>Manufacturers of other next-generation sequencing devices were evaluated. Other systems that were found are unable to generate a comparable quantity of data or acceptable sequencing accuracy. The only sequencer that provides this level of throughput, ease of use, sequencing efficiency, and sequencing accuracy is the Illumina NextSeq 500.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Illumina, Inc.. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to LeslieJones via email ONLY at jxy6@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 69538 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN June 23, 2014.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>This notice is being published in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation part 5.101(a)(2)(ii) requiring the dissemination of information for proposed contract actions. This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and prescribed by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A). <br> The 167 WVANG contracting office intends to issue a sole-source, firm-fixed price purchase order to F.A. O'Toole Office Systems, Inc. for the repurposing of 5 rooms in the Life Support Section.   F.A. O'Toole is the original installer of the Kardex Lektriever and Kardex Industriever equipment and only their employees are certified to move or modify their equipment.  The Life Support squadron currently has a maintenance contract agreement with the company to perform annual maintenance and repair on the aforementioned systems.  The remaining non-proprietary unique storage items that must be broken down, moved, and repurposed were also originally built and installed F.A. O'Toole; and splitting this requirement will result in a substantial increase of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. <br> This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, the government shall consider all responses received by Monday June 22th by 1400PM EST. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. A determination not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona-fide capability to fulfill the requirement. The 167th contracting office will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice. Please email TSgt. Kris Rata with responses or questions regarding this requirement at kris.rata@ang.af.mil or 304-616-5412. <br>

<DESC><p>MEMORANDUM<br />February 21,2014<br />TO: Pre-award File<br />U.S. Department of Justice<br />Office of the Inspector General<br />Washington, DC 20530<br />SUBJECT: Limited Source Justification for the Services of a Not-for-Profit Organization to<br />Conduct a Follow on Review of the Policies and Procedures of the Civil Rights<br />Division of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ)<br />In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6(g), the following is a justification to<br />issue a task order to the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) to conduct a<br />Congressionally-mandated independent review of management, policies, and operations in the Civil<br />Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations<br />Act, 2014, Public Law No. 113-76.<br />1. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.<br />U.S. Department of Justice<br />Office of the Inspector General<br />1425 New York Ave NW, Suite 7000<br />Washington, DC 20530<br />2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved.<br />The Deparbnent of Justice, Office of the Inspector General (010), proposes to award a<br />noncompetitive Task Order to the congressionally chartered non-profit agency National Academy<br />of Public Administration (NAP A) to complete an independent review of management, policies,<br />and operations in the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice. This award<br />will be issued as a "Finn Fixed Price" task order against the established Federal Supply Schedule<br />MOBIS Contract No. GS-10F-0414R, SIN 874-1, Consulting Services.<br />3. Description of the supplies or services, including the estimated value.<br />The OIG has an urgent requirement to contract for consulting services. The period of performance<br />shall be from time of award through January 6, 2015. The estimated value of the required services<br />is $1 million.<br />The contractor shall conduct an independent review of the management and policies of the Civil<br />Rights Division. The results of this review shall be submitted to the Committees on<br />Appropriations and to the 010 not later than January 6, 2015, and shall address shortcomings<br />identified in the March 2013 010 Report "A Review of the Operations of the Voting Section of<br />the Civil Rights Division," dating from at least December 2000, and include recommendations for<br />specific management and policy remedies for management and operations issues in the Civil<br />Rights Division.<br />1<br />4. The authority and supporting rationale (see 8.405-6(a)(l)(i) and (b)(l)) and, if applicable, a<br />demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply or<br />service.<br />The authority for this acquisition is FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A) --an urgent and compelling need<br />exists that would result in unacceptable delays if normal procurement procedures were followed.<br />In its Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 appropriation, the 010 was appropriated $1 million by the Congress<br />to complete an independent review of management, policies, and operations in the Civil Rights<br />Division of the United States Department of Justice. The primary purpose of this follow on<br />review is to gauge the Division's progress in implementing the recommendations made in a March<br />2013 010 report.<br />The appropriation requires that the OIG select a qualified third party to conduct the review. This<br />party must be completely neutral, independent, and have no conflict of interests, apparent or<br />otherwise. Additionally, because of the statutory deadline, the sensitivity and complexity of the<br />project, and difficulty of finding a qualified and impartial contractor who does not have a conflict<br />of interest (e.g., who has not had recent business with the Department of Justice or is involved in<br />litigation against the Department) it was determined that contracting with a not-for-profit<br />organization was the most appropriate course of action.<br />The selected contractor will have very limited time to conduct a thorough and comprehensive<br />review and prepare a final report to Congress. Additionally, given the circumstances and issues<br />that need to be addressed by the review, this situation requires the contractor to be completely<br />neutral, independent, and impartial. It also requires an experienced vendor in these types of<br />reviews that can provide very well qualified staff who can begin work immediately upon award of<br />the contract.<br />At all levels, the National Academy of Public Administration (NAP A) meets or even exceeds<br />these requirements. NAP A is a congressionally chartered, non-profit organization that was created<br />explicitly to help Government leaders analyze, evaluate, and improve Government operations.<br />NAP A is completely independent and non-partisan and highly experienced with a team of<br />nationally recognized fellows and staff. NAPA holds a MOBIS schedule contract (GS-10F-<br />0414R), which allows the Government to directly contract with it through the issuance of a task<br />order.<br />Given the statutorily set deadline, it is neither practical nor prudent to conduct a competitive<br />procurement for these services. It is anticipated that it would take at least two months to conduct a<br />competitive procurement under the MOBIS schedules and much longer if it was conducted on the<br />open market. Additionally, the Government is not even guaranteed that it would be able to obtain<br />the services of an acceptable contractor during a competitive process. There is also the risk that a<br />competitive procurement may draw protest, which would delay the work even further. This is<br />time that the Department of Justice can ill afford to spend given the tight statutorily set deadline<br />for this project. Accordingly, due to the high risk of unacceptable delays, it is in the Government's<br />best interest to issue a task order to NAPA on a limited sourced basis under the organization's<br />MOBIS schedule contract.<br />5. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the order represents the best value.<br />The anticipated price to the Government is approximately $1 million. The General Service<br />Administration (GSA) has determined the prices to be fair and reasonable under fixed price<br />schedule contracts. By placing the order against a schedule contract, the OIG Contracting Officer<br />2<br />concluded the order represents the best benefit to the Government and results in the lowest overall<br />cost alternative.<br />6. Description of market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of<br />the reason market research was not conducted.<br />Market research was conducted by examining the GSA MOBIS website for contractors under SIN<br />874 1 Consulting Services. Several contractors were identified, but the OIG Contracting Officer<br />detennined that, due to the urgent and compelling nature of the requirement, there is not sufficient<br />time to compete this requirement pursuant to the terms and conditions ofF AR Part 8.4.<br />7. Any other facts supporting justification.<br />None<br />8. Statement of actions taken to overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before<br />any subsequent acquisition is made.<br />In addition to the market research conducted as described above, capability statements were<br />requested from a limited number ofMOBIS SIN 874 1 schedule holders.<br />9. Contracting Officer's Certification.<br />I hereby certify that the information presented in this Justification is accurate and complete to the<br />best of my knowledge and belief.<br />g;~oml{fc ~<br />10. Technical Personnel Certification.<br />I hereby certify that the technical and background information provided to the Contracting Officer<br />which forms the basis of this Justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
