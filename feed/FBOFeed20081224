<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to negotiate a noncompetitive follow-on bridge contract withRaytheon for the continued development and maintenance of the Earth Observing System Dataand Information System (EOSDIS) Maintenance and Development (EMD).    The bridge contracttype will be cost-plus-award fee, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, and will havean eighteen month period of performance.  The statutory authority is FAR 6.302-1 which provides that full and open competition neednot be provided for when, in the case of follow-on contracts for the continueddevelopment or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, it is likelythat award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to theGovernment and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements.  This follow-on bridge contract with Raytheon will ensure the maintainability of essentialresearch and development capabilities for NASAs Earth Science Enterprise Program while afull and open competition is being conducted for a five year contract.	Because Raytheonis the incumbent contractor, substantial transition costs will not have to be expended. Transition of these services would require incurring significant costs associated withthe transfer of approximately of $47M of government property as well as the expense of anew contractor outfitting a computer facility to accommodate the equipment for this shortduration.  NASA/GSFC plans to award the contract to Raytheon Company, 5700 Rivertech Ct., Rm. 3034,Riverdale, Maryland.	Interests in subcontracting opportunitiesshould be directed to Raytheon at the above-mentioned address.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Hysitron Incorporated, of Eden Prairie, Minnesota for the purchase of an optics upgrade for NISTs existing Hysitron TI 900 Tribonindenter under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

The Ceramics Division of NISTs Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory requires an optics upgrade for its existing Hysitron TI 900 Triboindenter which will provide higher resolution, color, and digital zoom capabilities.  The current Triboindenter cannot resolve small targets for nano-mechanical test, but the optics and control upgrade will allow this capability.

As part of the upgrade, components in NISTs existing Hysitron TI 900 Triobindenter will be replaced.  The optical components to be installed are either proprietary Hysitron equipment or are designed to interact with proprietary Hysitron equipment and software, and cannot be provided by any other supplier.  Hysitron does not license its technology to other vendors.  In addition, the disassembly and installation of the upgrade must be done by Hysitron personnel as the equipment and technology is of proprietary design.  Hysitron Incorporated is thus the sole provider of this upgrade.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on January 8, 2009.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Coherent Incorporated, of Santa Clara, California for the purchase of a Verdi V12 Single Pulse VIS Pump Laser System as an upgrade for NISTs existing Coherent laser system under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106 b(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

The NIST Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory requires a Verdi V12 Single Pulse VIS Pump Laser System as an upgrade for its existing Coherent laser system.  This laser light source will be used in the development of a video rate, Coherent Anti-stokes Raman Scattering Optical Microscope.

To increase the stability and useable spectral coverage of a Coherent Anti-stokes Raman Scattering Optical Microscope, NIST requires a matched laser source that is a direct upgrade for the existing Coherent laser system.  The Verdi laser system with single frequency control will be coupled to NISTs existing Coherent Mira 900D ultrafast oscillator.  To achieve the necessary high efficiency coupling across a broad bandwidth (200 nm) and to take full advantage of the pre-existing optimization servos, matched components are required.

Coherent has developed this upgrade technology and has proprietary rights to that technology.    The existing equipment and technology are also proprietary to Coherent.  Coherent has no authorized distributors for its equipment.  Coherent Incorporated is thus the sole provider of this upgrade.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on January 8, 2009.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<CONTACT>Suet Y Vu, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-496-6546, Fax 301-402-0642, Email sv32d@nih.gov
<DESC><p>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), Toxicology and Environmental Information Program (TEHIP) to procure on a sole source basis with The Institute of Neurotoxicology and Neurological Disorders (INND) to host the World Library of Toxicology (WLT).</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 519190 and the business size standard is $6.5 million. NLM anticipates that award will be made on or about January 12, 2009.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />The period of performance shall be twelve (12) months from the effective date of award with four (4) one year options.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />Over the past several years, NLM's Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) has been building an online portal to global information resources relevant to its mission's core areas of toxicology, chemical safety, and environmental health. This multi-lateral, multi-lingual, World Library of Toxicology (WLT) offers a country-by-country listing of such resources as government organizations, non-government organizations, professional societies, academic programs, poison control centers, key documents, and legislation. It has been created with contributions from Country Correspondents around the world, and overseen by SIS staff. It consists of approximately 45 countries to date. Since the subject matter of the WLT falls somewhat outside NLM's core mission, NLM has chosen not to host it directly. Nonetheless, NLM recognizes the WLT's significance, and its relevance to international public health, and seeks to find another home for it, and continue to support its online public release and further development. Because of the highly collaborative nature of the WLT, NLM sees it as a suitable test bed for the use Web 2.0 technologies, particularly Wiki's. For greatest credibility and visibility, this project should be coordinated with an organization conversant with toxicology on the world stage. The International Union of Toxicology (IUTOX), the premier professional society promoting the global vision of toxicology in support of health, and a supporter of developing country interests, has agreed to partner with the Contractor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The Contractor will be responsible for hosting the WLT on its own server, and making it freely and publicly available online, maintaining the portal, including periodic checking for broken links, and corresponding with the Country Correspondents for updates and new country information. Further, the Contractor will seek ways to expand the WLT beyond the countries already included, identify additional international and multi-lateral ancillary resources for inclusion, and evaluate the interface, navigation, and design to assure ease of use. The Contractor will also be responsible for promotion and marketing of the WLT to the broad global environmental health community, and work with the IUTOX to expand the network of potential contacts and develop a scientific review mechanism. An SIS staff person will serve as NLM liaison in the role of Managing Editor, to oversee the direction of the work, and offer guidance, and consultation. The Contractor and SIS will assemble a Steering Team which will meet periodically to review, evaluate, and guide the WLT.</p>
<p>TASKS <br />The contractor will perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>1.1 Coordinate, with NLM, the migration of the WLT to their Web site, modifying it as necessary to conform to their technical specifications.</p>
<p>1.2 Perform a quality control check on the information, to assure its accuracy and completeness. This will include a comprehensive check for broken links, and making repairs, contacting Country Correspondents as needed and notifying them of the imminent release of the WLT to request a review of their respective country information. The Contractor will also ask of each Country Correspondent the name of a backup person in the event the Country Correspondent is no longer able to carry out his duties.</p>
<p>1.3. Develop a WLT logo, and release the WLT to the public, through a unique URL, http://www.wltox.org, which the Contractor will maintain.</p>
<p>1.4 Position the WLT in a Wiki-based environment to allow existing and prospective Country Correspondents to build and maintain their country pages and enter comments about other countries and other areas of the site.</p>
<p>1.5 Continue to nurture the expansion of the WLT by identifying other suitable countries and Country Correspondents for inclusion.</p>
<p>1.6. Determine ancillary features to add to the WLT to increase its utility.</p>
<p>1.7 Convene a WLT Steering Team to support the SIS Managing Editor in periodically assessing progress and setting goals.</p>
<p>1.8 Explore possibilities for a peer review mechanism, drawing on country, subject and language experts.</p>
<p>1.9 Develop a strategy to promote the WLT to the toxicology and environmental health communities worldwide.</p>
<p>1.10 Seek opportunities to offer training.</p>
<p>1.11 Investigate additional sources of funding to accelerate growth of the WLT and incorporate new features.</p>
<p><br />DELIVERABLES<br />1.1 Notification of successful migration of the WLT.</p>
<p>1.2 Quarterly progress reports identifying status and progress for the WLT.</p>
<p>1.3 Ongoing e-mail and phone consultation with Project Officer.</p>
<p><br />SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION<br />Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302, The Institute of Neurotoxicology and Neurological Disorders (INND) is the only known source that is capable of fulfilling this requirement. INND's technological assets are greatly and uniquely enhanced by a proposed collaboration with the IUTOX (International Union of Toxicology). It is the combined background and expertise of INND and IUTOX which results in the most credible justification for awarding the purchase order as a sole source. INND is unique in utilizing Wiki technology for a subject (toxicology) and audience (global) which conform with those of the WLT.</p>
<p>With NLM's decision to migrate the WLT to a non-government host, it is critical that the move be done as swiftly as possible to ensure the viability of the project. The combination of INND's and IUTOX's skill sets and the unfeasibility of bringing any other source, which would be expert in only a portion of what is required for the WLT, up to a level capable of managing the project in anything approaching a timely fashion.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, if any interested party believes it has the capability to fulfill the above requirement; it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NLM to determine if the party can perform this requirement. Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 3:00 PM EDT January 8, 2009. Faxed capability statements are NOT authorized. Questions must be submitted in writing to Suet Vu at vus@mail.nlm.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).</p>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 514199   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to enter into a sole source contract with the National Academy of Public Administration to test Web 2.0 technologies and processes to increase the transparency and quality of citizen interaction with the rulemaking process. Federal Agencies turn laws passed by Congress into concrete rules that clarify what is legally acceptable and what is not.  The agencies are required by law to seek public input on the rules they propose.  This public comment opportunity represents one of the broadest opportunities for citizens to influence how they are governed.  The proposed rule is targeted to the air quality area and the business process is a public meeting which would be held virtually and moderated by EPA staff.  Official comments will still be submitted by the public into Regulation.gov.The contract's purpose is to first to increase the public's learning about issues and further, to increase their ability to discuss and share their views, leading to more informed comments.  Secondly,  the contract will serve as a learning and testing opportunity for EPA and the Federal wide E-Rulemaking effort leveraging the past work done by the National Academy of  Public Administration's Collaboration Project.  The National Academy of Public Administration is a Congressionally chartered organization established for the purpose of advising and assisting the Federal Government with emerging management challenges.If there are any other question about this potential contract contact the Contracting Officer at caesar.sandra@epa.gov by e-mail or U.S. EPA 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Mail Code 3803R Washington, DC 20460 by mail.  All information must be received by January 7, 2009.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), 7700 Sandholdt Road, Moss Landing, CA 95039 for the acquisition of  a CustomEnvironmental Sample Processor (ESP). This instrument is necessary  to collect data through in situ monitoring for harmful algal blooms (HABS) in coastal waters. EPA's program needs and objective require acquisition of real-time measurement of the distribution and concentration of Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) indicator species, Alexandrium, in coastal waters of the Northeast. Thes measurements are needed to support timely warning to coastal managers of the occurrence of HABs and the probability of risk to human health so that appropriate monitoring and closures can be made. The US EPA will acquire a custom Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) with a DNA probe module specific to organisms that cause Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). The ESP casing will be competent for in-situ deployment on existing mooring within the Northeast Regional Association of Coastal Observing Systems (NERACOOS).  The EPA has identified Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) the only vendor capable of satisfying this requirement.  The circumstance permitting is FAR 13.106(B) "only one source reasonably available".  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provided the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability, no later than 15 days after the date of this publication. Submit your response:  to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Pamela E. Smith  by fax (919)541-4273; or, by e-mail at:  Smith.Pamela@epa.gov.  No telephone or faxed requests will be honored.

The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS Floria Jones, (706) 787-2094, floria.jones@us.army.mil  A.	General Information.  The Southeast Region (TRBO Reg. 3 & 4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in the countries of Honduras and Cuba, and the territory of Puerto Rico announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of SUCTION CANISTERS.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is May 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.    <BR>Point of Contact:  Floria Jones, (706) 787-2094,Floria.Jones@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of SUCTION CANISTERS, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $87,904.46.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to floria.jones@us.army.mil.  Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to floria.jones@us.army.mil by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  <BR>In general, 'acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.'  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Suction Canisters products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  <BR>a.	At a minimum the product line consists of disposable and reusable hard plastic suction canisters, large volume canisters, suction canister kits, flexible canister liners, lids and suction tubing, and canisters adaptable to common floor and wall vacuum systems.  The suction canisters must be available in a range of volume sizes (1000 ml to 3000 ml), and disposable large volume canisters available with and without specimen traps (12 to 16 liters).  The suction canister kits will include a disposable canister, patient tubing in lengths of 6 feet X 5 millimeters, and vacuum tubing in lengths of 18 inches X 5 millimeters.  The lids will include a bacterial filter and automatic shut off valve.  The suction tubing will be available in various lengths and sizes to include (3/16 inches X 6 feet,  inches X 6 and 9 feet), vacuum tubing in lengths of 18 inches X 5 millimeters.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes listed.  <BR>b.	Vendor MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (manufactured and/or distributed by brands) via catalog, and product literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type.  (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the Suction Canisters product line.  Vendor MUST provide DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, the prime vendor is Owens & Minor) for Suction Canisters in the Southeast Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.)  Vendor MUST provide supporting documentation (four digit code) of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal. <BR>4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for Suction Canisters products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.    <BR>6.	Vendor MUST provide Suction Canisters that are transparent with visual calibrations and graphics.  Vendors MUST provide documentation to support this with initial submittal.  (Vendors who do not provide Suction Canisters that are transparent with visual calibrations and graphics will be disqualified in Phase I.)<BR>7.	Vendor MUST provide latex safe/free products.  Vendor MUST provide list of all latex safe/free items supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.<BR><BR>Phase II Plan  Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR>Clinical/Performance Evaluations<BR>1.	Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent directly to the to the CPT members at participating Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs), and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the participating MTF address by COB, 5:00PM EST, (14th) calendar days after the notice to ship.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline to deliver the product samples by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Note: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets.  <BR>2.	Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical/patient care setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable.<BR>3.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for twenty-one (21) calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval).<BR>4.	To determine acceptability, the CPT, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Southeast Region will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a clinical/patient care setting. <BR>5.	Specific Rules of Engagement for this standardization initiative: A. Vendors will ONLY provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  Vendors that bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.  B. Vendors presence WILL NOT be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations. C. Vendors WILL NOT be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products OR THEIR COMPETITORS PRODUCTS.   D. Vendors WILL NOT be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or pricerelated factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process.  <BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR>1.	(Patient Safety Goal 7  Reduce the risk of health care associated infections)  Suction Canister system assembles easily and securely.<BR>a.	An improperly assembled suction system will lead to vacuum failure during emergency or clinical use. <BR>b.	The evaluator will assemble the canister system by applying canister lid, vacuum tubing, patient tubing, and attach to vacuum system gauge.  The system will be turned on and resistance applied to the patient tubing to ensure that the system is operational.<BR>2.  (Patient Safety Goal 7 - Reduce the risk of health care associated infections) Suction Canister port caps remain securely attached after application.  <BR>a. Suction Canister port caps must remain securely attached so that the contents do not leak medical waste when properly disposed.  . <BR> b. When canister is full, the evaluator will place the port cap per manufacturer guidelines and manually inspect the security of the cap and seal.  <BR>3.	(Patient Safety Goal 16 - Improve recognition and response to changes in a patients condition) the suction tubing fits securely.  <BR>a.	The suction tubing integrity must not be compromise to cause the system to loose vacuum, complicating medical procedure. <BR>b.	The evaluator will manually test the tubing by applying a range of suction pressures and observing tubing response.  <BR>4.  (Patient Safety Goal 16 - Improve recognition and response to change in patient condition) Suction Canister or canister liner are of consistent and even measurements.<BR>a.	Canister graduations must provide consistent measurements to allow accurate determination of fluid output/ removal. <BR>b.	The evaluator will manually instill a known measured quantity of liquid into the canister or canister liner to check accuracy of graduations. <BR>      <BR>Pricing Analysis Process.  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technical acceptable will be qualified/invited to provided their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Southeast Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB 5:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs. (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  (4) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.<BR>THE CLOSING DATE IS 23 JANUARY 2009 5:00 PM EST<BR><BR>

<p>&nbsp;<br />SECTION C - CONTRACT CLAUSES</p>
<p>C.1 Description/Work Statement</p>
<p>Purpose:<br />This position is located in NCHHSTP/GAP with a duty station in Nairobi, Kenya and is supervised under the direction of the Country Director by the USDH Senior Technical Advisor; however, technical aspects of the work are under the direction of the HIV Prevention Section Chief. The HIV/AIDS Prevention Program Advisor serves as a member of the PEPFAR Interagency Technical Team for Prevention. The PEPFAR Interagency Technical Team for Prevention provides overall direction and determines the budget allocation for all PEPFAR Prevention activities in Kenya. The Prevention Section Chief has responsibility for the overall direction of prevention activities of CDC-Kenya. This position serves as a technical advisor to the Prevention Section Chief and works with the PEPFAR team in-country and with governmental and non-governmental organizations to integrate prevention activities across all content areas. As such, this position requires regular interaction with people outside of the CDC Office. Incumbent often acts independently in performing tasks but is expected to bring difficult issues that may impact prevention activities in Kenya to the Prevention Section Chief for resolution.</p>
<p>Incumbent provides expert guidance to improve HIV/AIDS prevention and other related interventions with relevant Government of Kenya (GOK) Ministries (e.g., Ministry of Health [MOH] and National AIDS and STI Control Program [NASCOP]) and other governmental and non-governmental partners involved in the national fight against HIV/AIDS. As a member of the PEPFAR Interagency Technical Team for Prevention, incumbent serves as a specialist for implementation of specific HIV/AIDS prevention activities. Incumbent has primary responsibility for CDC-GAP activities in Nairobi but will also assist country-wide as needed. Although work is conducted within the CDC-GAP team in Nairobi, incumbent collaborates with the broader PEPFAR team to strengthen a unified approach to HIV prevention in Kenya. Incumbent provides knowledge to support existing prevention efforts as well as to contribute to the design, development and integration of prevention strategies across all program areas of PEPFAR Kenya. Incumbent participates in the development of Country Operational Plans (COP), annual work plans, and regular progress reports related to the prevention portfolio for CDC GAP, OGAC, and other collaborating partners.</p>
<p>Major Duties of the Position:</p>
<p>Program Integration: 30%<br />Provides direct technical assistance and support for the development, implementation, integration and mainstreaming of prevention activities across program areas, including the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT), Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT), Care and Treatment, TB/HIV, Medical Transmission/Blood Safety, Strategic Information/Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;I), Epidemiology and Surveillance, Laboratory, Health Education and Communications, Information Technology, Behavioral Science, Health Science, and/or Health Service Research issues. In close collaboration with these program areas, as well as with MOH/NASCOP/GOK and other key USG stakeholders and partners, incumbent creates model projects piloting integration across program areas to promote the mainstreaming of prevention and to be used in developing standard operating procedures (SOPs) or toolkits for launching other similar initiatives.</p>
<p>Program Implementation: 25%<br />Serve as Technical Lead for Positive Prevention (PP) by coordinating with the CDC-Kenya technical team across program areas to design and develop approaches that highlight integration of prevention interventions for HIV-positive individuals in each program area; promoting the development of standardized PP tools and materials to be used at a national level; providing technical assistance for the new WHO/CDC/MOH collaboration to establish operational guidelines and programmatic models for PP in TB settings; collaborating across USG agencies as well as with other key stakeholders both within and outside of Kenya to define best practices and universal SOPs, tools, and materials; to implement the Special PP Initiative being piloted in Kenya; to develop and implement activities / initiatives specifically designed to address the unique needs of the highly vulnerable group of discordant couples in Kenya; and, to direct the assessment of PP programming through public health evaluations and the analysis of routine programmatic data.</p>
<p>Program Development and Oversight: 25%<br />Incumbent develops creative ways to integrate a prevention mindset across program areas by participating in the development and refinement of country program strategies, and by providing technical oversight and assistance on prevention activities. Incumbent provides technical consultation and assistance to the CDC Office, local host government, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on how to integrate specific HIV/AIDS prevention programs and activities. Incumbent serves as the project officer for up to two of CDC-Kenya's large, umbrella, non-governmental cooperative agreements, currently receiving over $9M in CDC-awarded funds. As project officer, incumbent provides technical guidance to recipients on supporting sub-grantees' programs and activities; works with recipients' technical teams to develop innovative strategies to respond to the HIV epidemic in Kenya using an evidence-based approach; supports identification of new sub-partners to undertake such work; assures technical review and provides guidance on project proposals and requests for project funding; and, orchestrates unified coordination from the CDC-GAP technical team across the multiple program areas in which the umbrella project is funded.</p>
<p>Program Coordination: 20%<br />Serves as a member of the USG (PEPFAR) Interagency Technical Team for Prevention to establish, expand, define, and leverage available resources and strategic partnerships with GOK Ministries, collaborating organizations, and other appropriate partners to improve prevention and support services for families and people affected by HIV/AIDS. Incumbent establishes and builds collaboration and synergies among MOH and USG implementing partners and other agencies and organizations, and facilitates dialogue and mutual work relationships between implementing partners, local government entities, and other HIV/AIDS stakeholders. Incumbent participates in the development of the CDC-GAP portion of the prevention portfolio for Kenya's COP and fulfills prevention-related reporting requirements and responds to inquiries from Headquarters and elsewhere on the CDC-GAP prevention portfolio.</p>

<p><br />e. Clearances <br />(a) Medical</p>
<p><br />1) U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are eligible for Health Unit services if the following conditions are met:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC's contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.</p>
<p>-- The employing agency is paying for medical services under the International Cooperative Support Services (ICASS) and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.</p>
<p><br />2) Non-U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are ineligible for Health Unit services. However, CDC policy mandates that the PSC must meet the following conditions:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain medical evacuation (medevac) coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service. See C.3.i. Insurance (3) Medevac Insurance (b).</p>
<p>3) For all assignments outside of the United States, the contractor and any authorized dependents shall be required to be examined by one or more licensed doctors of medicine acceptable to CDC, and the contractor shall forward a summary of the results of the medical exams as well as copies of the original tests and laboratory reviews to the CDC's Office of Health and Safety (OHS) for adjudication as to whether the requirements of the position and assignment are met. For non-U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS makes these determinations internally but for U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS passes their recommendations on to Department of State's Office of Medical Services (State/MED) for a final determination. The OHS or State/MED decision is furnished to the Contracting Officer prior to the official award of a contract. The Government shall reimburse the contractor for all costs associated with obtaining the aforementioned medical clearance examinations. Note: The official award of a contract is dependent upon the successful completion of the medical clearance. If the medical clearance is not granted and a waiver is not obtained, the contractor may be ineligible for award.</p>
<p><br />(b) Suitability Background Check<br />Based on the required Suitability Background Check, contractor shall have no access to classified or administratively controlled materials. However, failure to obtain the Suitability Background Check required for full performance of all duties described in the position description may deem the offeror ineligible for award or, if already awarded, constitute cause for contract termination. Security clearance is not required at this time, however, should such clearance become required during the period of performance of the contract, contractor shall be required to obtain security clearance prior to having access to classified information. Note: The official award of a contract is dependent upon the successful completion of the Suitability Background Check. If the Suitability Background Check is not granted, the contractor may be ineligible for award.</p>
<p><br />f. Work Week and Compensation<br />The contractor's workweek shall not be less than 40 hours, unless otherwise provided in the Contract Schedule, and shall coincide with the workweek for those employed by the Mission or the host country agency most closely associated with the work of this contract. If the contract is for less than full time (40 hours weekly), the annual and sick leave earned shall be prorated (see the general provision of this contract entitled Leave and Holidays).<br />The contractor's compensation shall not be adjusted to reflect the pay comparability adjustments, which are granted from time to time to U.S. direct-hire employees by Executive Order for the statutory pay systems.</p>
<p><br />g. Leave and Holidays<br />1) Annual Leave:<br />(i) The rate of earned vacation leave is determined on a case-by-case basis by the Coordinating Office for Global Health (COGH). In making this determination, COGH considers the individual's previous relevant service to the US Government through any of various employment, contractual, or grantee arrangements. However, no annual leave credit shall be earned if the tour of duty is less than 90 calendar days. Former Civil Service and CDC contractual service is creditable towards PSC service for annual leave accumulation purposes. Leave is granted at the following accumulation rates per pay period, based on relevant service credited by COGH:</p>
<p>0 to 3 years: 6 hrs.<br />Over 3 years: 8 hrs.</p>
<p>(These rates are based on a combination of annual leave and home leave granted to members of the Foreign Service.)<br />(ii) It is understood that vacation leave is provided under this contract primarily for the purposes of affording necessary rest and recreation during the tour of duty in the host country. The Contractor in consultation with the CDC Field Supervisor shall develop a vacation leave schedule early in his/her tour of duty taking into consideration project requirements, employee preference and other factors. Unused annual leave will be reimbursed at the end of the period of performance of the resultant contract provided such leave does not exceed the number of days that can be earned by the PSC during a twelve-month period.<br />(iii) With the approval of the CDC Field Supervisor, and if the circumstances warrant, a contractor may be granted advance vacation leave in excess in that earned, but in no case shall a contractor be granted advance vacation leave in excess of that which he/she will earn over the life of the contract. The contractor agrees to reimburse CDC for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the contractor's assignment under the contract.<br />Based upon the selectee's application, the selectee shall earn vacation leave at the following rate schedule:<br />Base Year - 6 hrs. per pay period<br />2nd Option Year and thereafter - 8 hrs. per pay period</p>
<p><br />2) Sick Leave: Sick leave is earned at a rate not to exceed 13 workdays per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Unused sick leave may be carried over under an extension of this contract for the same or similar services at the same mission, but the contractor will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of this contract. Sick leave may be carried over from one post to another whether or not a break in service occurs.</p>
<p><br />3) Relief Travel<br />The contractor shall be entitled to the reimbursement of air travel to return to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractors' recruitment, whichever is more cost efficient to the Government. Relief travel refers to the reimbursement of air travel only and is earned for service outside the continental United States that allows the contractor to return to the city of last legal residence at the time of the contractors' recruitment, or to any other place the contractor chooses, but reimbursable only up to the cost of round-trip tickets for the contractor and legal dependents at post to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractors' recruitment, which ever is more cost efficient to the Government. If the contractor wants to go elsewhere, the costs reimbursed will be limited to those costs equal to the contractor's last residence at time of recruitment. The contractor shall be responsible for all additional costs above those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of recruitment. If the costs are less than those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of recruitment, then the reimbursable costs would be limited to the total cost of the trip. The contractor and dependents shall be eligible for relief travel when the following conditions are met:<br />i. The period of performance of awarded contract is for a minimum of 12 months. <br />ii. One relief travel reimbursement shall be granted per 12-month contract period served at place of performance as designated in the contract.<br />iii. Contractor must have served a minimum of 6 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract at commencement of Relief Travel.<br />iv. Contractor must serve a minimum of 3 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract upon return from Relief Travel.<br />v. The contractor must have earned sufficient annual leave to allow for subject travel.<br />Exceptions to the above conditions shall be coordinated with COGH. Exceptions shall be based on extenuating circumstances only. If the period of performance of resultant contract exceeds 12 months or an option is exercised, and the contractor qualifies for relief travel, each relief travel reimbursement shall be used a minimum of 6 months apart. The contractor shall be reimbursed for any cancellation cost that is incurred caused by the Government.</p>
<p><br />4) Emergency Travel<br />Emergency transportation costs will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel&nbsp;above. To be eligible for reimbursement of transportation costs under emergency conditions, one of the following circumstances must exist:<br />(i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to which the employee is assigned or serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty. CDC Field Supervisor or Government Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at contractor expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is necessary.</p>
<p>(ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the immediate family of the employee as determined by COGH or the immediate family of the employee's spouse.</p>
<p>When, for any reason, the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO determines it is necessary to evacuate the contractor or contractor's dependents, the contractor will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. The return of such employees and dependents may also be authorized by the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO when, in his/her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to do so.<br />The CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO may also authorize the reimbursement of emergency transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, the circumstances warrant such action. The authorization shall include the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time away from post, transportation of personal and household effects, etc.</p>
<p><br />5) Holidays <br />The contractor, while serving abroad, shall be entitled to all USG holidays and may also be excused from duty on local holidays and other occasions when the U.S. embassy is closed. However, there will be no additional compensation should the PSC be required to work on a local holiday that is not a U.S. holiday.</p>
<p><br />6) Leave Without Pay <br />Leave without pay may be granted only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>7) Compensatory Time and Overtime<br />The accrual and use of Compensatory (Comp) Time may be approved in lieu of overtime pay for irregular or occasional overtime work. A PSC employee whose contract does not provide for overtime pay may be awarded Comp Time for overtime hours worked. One hour of Comp Time off is granted for each hour of overtime work. The accrual and use of Comp Time is subject to written supervisory approval, as with Annual Leave. All Comp Time hours must be recorded on the Time and Attendance Report as they are earned and used.</p>
<p>A PSC employee will lose entitlement to Comp Time earned if it is not used by the end of eight pay periods immediately after having been earned (16 weeks beginning the first pay period after the pay period in which the Comp Time was earned), unless the failure was due to an exigency of the service beyond the employee's control.<br />Overtime and Sunday Differential are not authorized under this contract. Should overtime be required during the performance of this contract, the Field Supervisor shall submit a request for contract modification.</p>
<p><br />8) Passport<br />All passports shall be valid the entire period of performance of the contract. In the event that a passport expires during the period of performance of resulting contract, a copy of the renewed passport shall be submitted to the PCO.</p>
<p><br />h. Social Security, Federal Income Tax and Foreign Earned Income - Applies to only U.S. Citizens and Permanent Resident Aliens of the U.S. subject to U.S. Federal Income and FICA laws<br />1) As a Personal Service Contract employee, when applicable, F.I.C.A. contributions and U.S. Federal Income Tax withholding shall be deducted from salary payments in accordance with regulations and rulings of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, respectively.</p>
<p>2) As a Personal Service Contract employee, the contractor is not eligible for the "foreign earned income" exclusion under the IRS Regulations (see 26 CFR 1.911-3(c)(3)).</p>
<p><br />i. Insurance<br />1) Worker's Compensation Benefits<br />The contractor shall be provided worker's compensation benefits in accordance with the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.</p>
<p><br />2) Health and Life Insurance.<br />a) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 75% against the actual costs of the contractor's annual health insurance costs, excluding costs for private medical evacuation (medevac) insurance, if any, provided that such costs may not exceed the maximum U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program, as announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<p><br />b) The contractor shall be provided a contribution of 33 1/3% against the actual costs of annual basic life insurance coverage on the same basis as the U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) Program. Basic life insurance coverage is defined as coverage up to an amount equal to the contractor's annual basic salary rounded up to the next even $1,000 plus $2,000.</p>
<p><br />c) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts. The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide or specifically exclude coverage overseas. In such cases, the contractor could be eligible for contributions under paragraphs i.2(a) and/or (b) of this provision.</p>
<p><br />d) Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid. On assignments of less than one year, costs for health and life insurance shall be prorated and paid accordingly.</p>
<p><br />e) A contractor who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse's Government health and/or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under&nbsp;i. Insurance 1) and/or 2), respectively, of this provision.</p>
<p><br />3) Medevac Insurance<br />a) U.S. Citizens: U.S. citizens are furnished medical evacuation service at no cost.</p>
<p><br />b) Non U.S. citizens will not qualify for health unit access during the period of performance of the resultant contract and, if a contract is offered, will be responsible for obtaining required medical evacuation (medevac) insurance. CDC shall reimburse 100% of the cost of medevac insurance maintained by the contractor. CDC does not require that contractor obtains coverage from any one specific company. The contractor is responsible for and has the discretion to choose a provider. For information purposes only: The Department of State maintains a list of U.S. based providers on the following website: <br /><a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/brochures/brochures_1215.html">http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/brochures/brochures_1215.html</a></p>
<p><br />CDC provides no endorsement, expressly or implied, of any emergency medical service provider. Contractors have full discretion to consider providers not provided in this list, but are expected to verify that the coverage they do obtain will adequately cover an evacuation due to a medical situation that arises in the location of contract performance. CDC shall approve a fair and reasonable amount for obtaining the required coverage as a direct cost to the contract. After receipt of an offer letter, the contractor shall furnish evidence of obtaining medevac insurance and its cost, for the employee and all accompanying family members on U.S. Government travel orders, in order for CDC to reimburse the fair and reasonable cost of medevac insurance.</p>
<p><br />j. Performance Review<br />This is a Performance Based Contract with a requirement for an evaluation of contractor performance to be conducted at least once every 12 months. The initial evaluation will take place 6 months after contract award and each subsequent evaluation will be performed annually 12 months from the date of the initial evaluation, and each year thereafter on a recurring 12 month schedule. A final evaluation will be performed at contract completion. The Performance Based Matrix included in this contract as Attachment 1 will serve as the basis for evaluation. A Personal Services Contractor Evaluation Form will be used and will be provided after contract award. Awarding of any contract extension shall be contingent upon receipt of an evaluation reflecting at least a satisfactory (acceptable, passing) level of performance under the contract during the previous 12 months of service. The reviews shall be scheduled and coordinated with the CDC Field Supervisor. The Field Supervisor shall provide the PSC employee with the appropriate performance standards for this position.</p>
<p><br />k. Allowances and Differentials<br />Overseas allowances and differentials similar to those available to U.S. Government employees assigned abroad may be payable under this PSC, subject to eligibility. Actual benefits may vary from one candidate to the next and/or from one country of assignment to the next.

<p>d. Employee Responsibilities and Conduct<br />The employee must comply with certain U.S. Government laws governing employee conduct, including the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch in 5 CFR Part 2635, the conflict of interest laws in Chapter 11 of Title 18 of the United States Code, the financial disclosure requirements in 5 CFR Part 2634, the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, and 3 FAM 4120 (Employee Responsibilities Abroad). Reference the following links for additional information:<br />Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch in 5 CFR Part 2635: <br />2002 CFR Title 5, Volume 3<br />Conflict of Interest laws in Chapter 11 of Title 18 of the United States Code: <br />Title 18 United States Code<br />Financial Disclosure requirements in 5 CFR Part 2634: http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/5cfr2634_05.html<br />The Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution (See Sec. 9, Clause 8): http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Constitution.html <br />3 FAM 4120 (Employee Responsibilities Abroad): <br />http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/85177.pdf</p>
<p>e. Clearances <br />(a) Medical<br />1) U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are eligible for Health Unit services if the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.</p>
<p>-- The PSC must maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.</p>
<p>-- The PSC's contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.<br /><br />-- The employing agency is paying for medical services under the International Cooperative Support Services (ICASS) and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.</p>
<p>2) Non-U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are ineligible for Health Unit services. However, CDC policy mandates that the PSC must meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.</p>
<p>-- The PSC must have and maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.</p>
<p>-- The PSC must have and maintain medical evacuation (medevac) coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service. See C.3.i. Insurance (3) Medevac Insurance (b).</p>
<p>3) For all assignments outside of the United States, the contractor and any authorized dependents shall be required to be examined by one or more licensed doctors of medicine acceptable to CDC, and the contractor shall forward a summary of the results of the medical exams as well as copies of the original tests and laboratory reviews to the CDC's Office of Health and Safety (OHS) for adjudication as to whether the requirements of the position and assignment are met. For non-U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS makes these determinations internally but for U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS passes their recommendations on to Department of State's Office of Medical Services (State/MED) for a final determination. The OHS or State/MED decision is furnished to the Contracting Officer prior to the official award of a contract. The Government shall reimburse the contractor for all costs associated with obtaining the aforementioned medical clearance examinations. Note: The official award of a contract is dependent upon the successful completion of the medical clearance. If the medical clearance is not granted and a waiver is not obtained, the contractor may be ineligible for award.</p>
<p>(b) Suitability Background Check<br />Based on the required Suitability Background Check, contractor shall have no access to classified or administratively controlled materials. However, failure to obtain the Suitability Background Check required for full performance of all duties described in the position description may deem the offeror ineligible for award or, if already awarded, constitute cause for contract termination. Security clearance is not required at this time, however, should such clearance become required during the period of performance of the contract, contractor shall be required to obtain security clearance prior to having access to classified information. Note: The official award of a contract is dependent upon the successful completion of the Suitability Background Check. If the Suitability Background Check is not granted, the contractor may be ineligible for award.</p>
<p>f. Work Week and Compensation<br />The contractor's workweek shall not be less than 40 hours, unless otherwise provided in the Contract Schedule, and shall coincide with the workweek for those employed by the Mission or the host country agency most closely associated with the work of this contract. If the contract is for less than full time (40 hours weekly), the annual and sick leave earned shall be prorated (see the general provision of this contract entitled Leave and Holidays).</p>
<p>The contractor's compensation shall not be adjusted to reflect the pay comparability adjustments, which are granted from time to time to U.S. direct-hire employees by Executive Order for the statutory pay systems.</p>
<p>g. Leave and Holidays<br />1) Annual Leave:</p>
<p>(i) The rate of earned vacation leave is determined on a case-by-case basis by the Coordinating Office for Global Health (COGH). In making this determination, COGH considers the individual's previous relevant service to the US Government through any of various employment, contractual, or grantee arrangements. However, no annual leave credit shall be earned if the tour of duty is less than 90 calendar days. Former Civil Service and CDC contractual service is creditable towards PSC service for annual leave accumulation purposes. Leave is granted at the following accumulation rates per pay period, based on relevant service credited by COGH:<br /><br />0 to 3 years: 6 hrs.<br />Over 3 years: 8 hrs.<br /><br />(These rates are based on a combination of annual leave and home leave granted to members of the Foreign Service.)</p>
<p>(ii) It is understood that vacation leave is provided under this contract primarily for the purposes of affording necessary rest and recreation during the tour of duty in the host country. The Contractor in consultation with the CDC Field Supervisor shall develop a vacation leave schedule early in his/her tour of duty taking into consideration project requirements, employee preference and other factors. Unused annual leave will be reimbursed at the end of the period of performance of the resultant contract provided such leave does not exceed the number of days that can be earned by the PSC during a twelve-month period.</p>
<p>(iii) With the approval of the CDC Field Supervisor, and if the circumstances warrant, a contractor may be granted advance vacation leave in excess in that earned, but in no case shall a contractor be granted advance vacation leave in excess of that which he/she will earn over the life of the contract. The contractor agrees to reimburse CDC for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the contractor's assignment under the contract.</p>
<p>Based upon the selectee's application, the selectee shall earn vacation leave at the following rate schedule:</p>
<p>Base Year - 6 hrs. per pay period<br />2nd Option Year and thereafter - 8 hrs. per pay period</p>
<p>2) Sick Leave: Sick leave is earned at a rate not to exceed 13 workdays per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Unused sick leave may be carried over under an extension of this contract for the same or similar services at the same mission, but the contractor will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of this contract. Sick leave may be carried over from one post to another whether or not a break in service occurs.</p>
<p>3) Relief Travel<br />The contractor shall be entitled to the reimbursement of air travel to return to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractors' recruitment, whichever is more cost efficient to the Government. Relief travel refers to the reimbursement of air travel only and is earned for service outside the continental United States that allows the contractor to return to the city of last legal residence at the time of the contractors' recruitment, or to any other place the contractor chooses, but reimbursable only up to the cost of round-trip tickets for the contractor and legal dependents at post to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractors' recruitment, which ever is more cost efficient to the Government. If the contractor wants to go elsewhere, the costs reimbursed will be limited to those costs equal to the contractor's last residence at time of recruitment. The contractor shall be responsible for all additional costs above those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of recruitment. If the costs are less than those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of recruitment, then the reimbursable costs would be limited to the total cost of the trip. The contractor and dependents shall be eligible for relief travel when the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>i. The period of performance of awarded contract is for a minimum of 12 months. <br />ii. One relief travel reimbursement shall be granted per 12-month contract period served at place of performance as designated in the contract.<br />iii. Contractor must have served a minimum of 6 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract at commencement of Relief Travel.<br />iv. Contractor must serve a minimum of 3 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract upon return from Relief Travel.<br />v. The contractor must have earned sufficient annual leave to allow for subject travel.</p>
<p>Exceptions to the above conditions shall be coordinated with COGH. Exceptions shall be based on extenuating circumstances only. If the period of performance of resultant contract exceeds 12 months or an option is exercised, and the contractor qualifies for relief travel, each relief travel reimbursement shall be used a minimum of 6 months apart. The contractor shall be reimbursed for any cancellation cost that is incurred caused by the Government.</p>
<p>4) Emergency Travel<br />Emergency transportation costs will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel&nbsp;above. To be eligible for reimbursement of transportation costs under emergency conditions, one of the following circumstances must exist:</p>
<p>(i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to which the employee is assigned or serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty. CDC Field Supervisor or Government Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at contractor expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is necessary. <br /><br />(ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the immediate family of the employee as determined by COGH or the immediate family of the employee's spouse. <br /><br />When, for any reason, the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO determines it is necessary to evacuate the contractor or contractor's dependents, the contractor will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel&nbsp;above. The return of such employees and dependents may also be authorized by the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO when, in his/her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to do so.</p>
<p>The CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO may also authorize the reimbursement of emergency transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, the circumstances warrant such action. The authorization shall include the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time away from post, transportation of personal and household effects, etc.</p>
<p>5) Holidays <br />The contractor, while serving abroad, shall be entitled to all USG holidays and may also be excused from duty on local holidays and other occasions when the U.S. embassy is closed. However, there will be no additional compensation should the PSC be required to work on a local holiday that is not a U.S. holiday.</p>
<p>6) Leave Without Pay <br />Leave without pay may be granted only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer. <br /><br />7) Compensatory Time and Overtime<br />The accrual and use of Compensatory (Comp) Time may be approved in lieu of overtime pay for irregular or occasional overtime work. A PSC employee whose contract does not provide for overtime pay may be awarded Comp Time for overtime hours worked. One hour of Comp Time off is granted for each hour of overtime work. The accrual and use of Comp Time is subject to written supervisory approval, as with Annual Leave. All Comp Time hours must be recorded on the Time and Attendance Report as they are earned and used.<br /><br />A PSC employee will lose entitlement to Comp Time earned if it is not used by the end of eight pay periods immediately after having been earned (16 weeks beginning the first pay period after the pay period in which the Comp Time was earned), unless the failure was due to an exigency of the service beyond the employee's control.</p>
<p>Overtime and Sunday Differential are not authorized under this contract. Should overtime be required during the performance of this contract, the Field Supervisor shall submit a request for contract modification.</p>
<p>8) Passport<br />All passports shall be valid the entire period of performance of the contract. In the event that a passport expires during the period of performance of resulting contract, a copy of the renewed passport shall be submitted to the PCO.</p>
<p>h. Social Security, Federal Income Tax and Foreign Earned Income - Applies to only U.S. Citizens and Permanent Resident Aliens of the U.S. subject to U.S. Federal Income and FICA laws<br />1) As a Personal Service Contract employee, when applicable, F.I.C.A. contributions and U.S. Federal Income Tax withholding shall be deducted from salary payments in accordance with regulations and rulings of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, respectively. <br /><br />2) As a Personal Service Contract employee, the contractor is not eligible for the "foreign earned income" exclusion under the IRS Regulations (see 26 CFR 1.911-3(c)(3)).</p>
<p>i. Insurance</p>
<p>1) Worker's Compensation Benefits</p>
<p>The contractor shall be provided worker's compensation benefits in accordance with the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.</p>
<p>2) Health and Life Insurance.</p>
<p>a) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 75% against the actual costs of the contractor's annual health insurance costs, excluding costs for private medical evacuation (medevac) insurance, if any, provided that such costs may not exceed the maximum U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program, as announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<p>b) The contractor shall be provided a contribution of 33 1/3% against the actual costs of annual basic life insurance coverage on the same basis as the U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) Program. Basic life insurance coverage is defined as coverage up to an amount equal to the contractor's annual basic salary rounded up to the next even $1,000 plus $2,000.<br />c) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts. The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide or specifically exclude coverage overseas. In such cases, the contractor could be eligible for contributions under i.2(a) and/or (b) of this provision.</p>
<p>d) Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid. On assignments of less than one year, costs for health and life insurance shall be prorated and paid accordingly.</p>
<p>e) A contractor who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse's Government health and/or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under .i. Insurance 1) and/or 2), respectively, of this provision.</p>
<p>3) Medevac Insurance</p>
<p>a) U.S. Citizens: U.S. citizens are furnished medical evacuation service at no cost.</p>
<p>b) Non U.S. citizens will not qualify for health unit access during the period of performance of the resultant contract and, if a contract is offered, will be responsible for obtaining required medical evacuation (medevac) insurance. CDC shall reimburse 100% of the cost of medevac insurance maintained by the contractor. CDC does not require that contractor obtains coverage from any one specific company. The contractor is responsible for and has the discretion to choose a provider. For information purposes only: The Department of State maintains a list of U.S. based providers on the following website: <br />http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/brochures/brochures_1215.html</p>
<p>CDC provides no endorsement, expressly or implied, of any emergency medical service provider. Contractors have full discretion to consider providers not provided in this list, but are expected to verify that the coverage they do obtain will adequately cover an evacuation due to a medical situation that arises in the location of contract performance. CDC shall approve a fair and reasonable amount for obtaining the required coverage as a direct cost to the contract. After receipt of an offer letter, the contractor shall furnish evidence of obtaining medevac insurance and its cost, for the employee and all accompanying family members on U.S. Government travel orders, in order for CDC to reimburse the fair and reasonable cost of medevac insurance.</p>
<p>j. Performance Review</p>

The initial evaluation will take place 6 months after contract award and each subsequent evaluation will be performed annually 12 months from the date of the initial evaluation, and each year thereafter on a recurring 12 month schedule. A final evaluation will be performed at contract completion. The Performance Based Matrix included in this contract as Attachment 1 will serve as the basis for evaluation. A Personal Services Contractor Evaluation Form will be used and will be provided after contract award. Awarding of any contract extension shall be contingent upon receipt of an evaluation reflecting at least a satisfactory (acceptable, passing) level of performance under the contract during the previous 12 months of service. The reviews shall be scheduled and coordinated with the CDC Field Supervisor. The Field Supervisor shall provide the PSC employee with the appropriate performance standards for this position.</p>

<p>q. Supervision<br />Contractor shall perform all duties under the authority of the United States Chief of Mission in Lesotho. Performance of the work hereunder shall be subject to the direction of the designated supervisor for the position filled by the individual performing services under this contract.</p>
<p>As used herein, the supervisor's directions are directions to the PSC Employee, which fill in details, suggest possible lines of inquiry, or otherwise complete the position description set forth herein. In the event that the PSC Employee feels that full implementation of the supervisor's direction may exceed the duties and responsibilities provided in the position description, he or she shall notify the supervisor and the Contracting Officer in a letter separate of any required report(s) within two (2) weeks of the date of receipt of the disputed direction and no action shall be taken pursuant to the direction. If the PSC employee fails to provide the required notification within the said two (2) week period that any direction exceeds the duties and responsibilities provided in the position description, then it shall be deemed for purposes of this contract that the direction was within reasonability of the required functions contained in the position description. No direction, nor its fulfillment, shall alter or abrogate the rights and obligations fixed in this contract.</p>
<p>The Government supervisor is not authorized to change any of the terms and conditions of this contract. Changes shall be made only by the Contracting Officer by properly written modification(s) to the contract.

Failure to complete the PFWO training or approved alternative training within 120 days from date of offer letter or, if already entered on duty under the PSC, within 120 days after entry on duty, may result in either a rescission of the offer or termination of the contract, as applicable. Upon completion of the PFWO training or approved alternative training, the PSC shall provide evidence of completion to the Contracting Officer such as a copy of the certificate. Note: The official award of a contract is dependent upon the successful completion of the PFWO course. If the PFWO course is not granted, the contractor may be ineligible for award.</p>

EVALUATIONCOMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Price

Technical and delivery, when combined, are ____N/A______when compared to price.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.2 12-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items (MAR 2005) with their offer.

Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items (SEP 2005), is hereby incorporated by reference.

PROMPT PAYMENT TERMS

The vendor will provide prompt payment discount terms in their proposal.

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS

A. Systems Submission of Invoices. 

 Invoice submission is a two step process:

The Vendor shall develop an Acceptance Information document in IT Solutions Shop (ITSS) and attach a copy of invoice with all required back-up documentation.

     Current ITSS web site https://it-solutions.gsa.gov

The Vendor shall also complete the invoice form on the Finance web site and attach soft copy of invoice.  This is the official system of record; the invoice will not be processed for payment unless this process is completed.  

     Current General Services Administration (GSA) Finance web site is www.finance.gsa.gov.  Go to
    http://finance.gsa.gov/password/ to obtain Password/Sign-Up for Email Notification.

B. Invoice Submission Process.

	Submit each invoice only once.  Submitting multiple copies confuses and delays processing.

	If editing is required, update the first submission; dont create a second invoice submission.

	Make sure the invoice amount and the acceptance document amount are the same.

	Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Dont use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

	Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

	If an invoice is rejected, a corrected invoice will be submitted using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. R to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

	In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice. This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

	Invoice must be submitted in ITSS on Acceptance Information document and include copy of invoice and required back-up attached.

C. Timing of invoices.

Invoices shall be submitted for payment of deliverables that have been completed and accepted by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).

For Firm Fixed Price (FFP), this will be a completed and accepted deliverable.  Evidence that the COR accepted the deliverable must be present before the GSA Project Manager (PM) can proceed.  Ensure the invoice is submitted in accordance with the established payment schedule.  

For Time and Material (T&M), this will be a months worth of services.  The COR will certify that the contractor has performed in accordance with the statement of work and the government has received the hours and/or materials billed by the contractor.  Ensure the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, are fully complied with.  GSA PM will certify the invoice for payment.

D. Payment of Invoices.

Payment of invoices shall be based on the quality of the invoiced deliverable.  If the invoiced deliverable does not meet the established contractual standards, the invoice will not be paid until the deliverable has been determined to meet the established standards, as applicable.

	The contractor is reminded that invoices will be submitted In accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions  Commercial Items, paragraph g, which states the following:

(x) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS

A. Systems Submission of Invoices. 

 Invoice submission is a two step process:

The Vendor shall develop an Acceptance Information document in IT Solutions Shop (ITSS) and attach a copy of invoice with all required back-up documentation.

     Current ITSS web site https://it-solutions.gsa.gov

The Vendor shall also complete the invoice form on the Finance web site and attach soft copy of invoice.  This is the official system of record; the invoice will not be processed for payment unless this process is completed.  

     Current General Services Administration (GSA) Finance web site is www.finance.gsa.gov.  Go to
    http://finance.gsa.gov/password/ to obtain Password/Sign-Up for Email Notification.

B. Invoice Submission Process.

	Submit each invoice only once.  Submitting multiple copies confuses and delays processing.

	If editing is required, update the first submission; dont create a second invoice submission.

	Make sure the invoice amount and the acceptance document amount are the same.

	Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Dont use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

	Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

	If an invoice is rejected, a corrected invoice will be submitted using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. R to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

	In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice. This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

	Invoice must be submitted in ITSS on Acceptance Information document and include copy of invoice and required back-up attached.

C. Timing of invoices.

Invoices shall be submitted for payment of deliverables that have been completed and accepted by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).

For Firm Fixed Price (FFP), this will be a completed and accepted deliverable.  Evidence that the COR accepted the deliverable must be present before the GSA Project Manager (PM) can proceed.  Ensure the invoice is submitted in accordance with the established payment schedule.  

For Time and Material (T&M), this will be a months worth of services.  The COR will certify that the contractor has performed in accordance with the statement of work and the government has received the hours and/or materials billed by the contractor.  Ensure the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, are fully complied with.  GSA PM will certify the invoice for payment.

D. Payment of Invoices.

Payment of invoices shall be based on the quality of the invoiced deliverable.  If the invoiced deliverable does not meet the established contractual standards, the invoice will not be paid until the deliverable has been determined to meet the established standards, as applicable.

	The contractor is reminded that invoices will be submitted In accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions  Commercial Items, paragraph g, which states the following:

<p>Name Brand Justification for RM Young Wind Monitors Replacement Parts</p>
<p>&bull; The RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors are the standard wind monitoring sensors used at CO-OPS environmental monitoring stations on the Atlantic coast below the Mason-Dixon Line, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and throughout the Pacific. Implementing different sensors in place of the current sensors will result in additional cost and resources. Also, there will be resulting delay for testing, training, and purchase of support equipment. <br />&bull; Under the current CO-OPS operating system any environmental monitoring sensor that has not been previously approved must be subjected to a series of tests to ensure the quality of the data produced by that sensor and the durability of that sensor for the intended use. These tests usually include bench testing using controlled conditions and physical measurement, controlled environmental testing to check a sensor's reliability under different conditions, and long term comparison testing with accepted sensors at multiple real world locations. These tests and the analysis of the resulting data take a large amount of time, money, and resources to conduct. <br />&bull; These RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors are tied to a series of data collection software and existing infrastructure and are replacements in kind due to a high consumable rate as a result of where they are positioned on piers, buoys, etc.<br />&bull; CO-OPS stations are designed for optimal performance of the RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors. A change of sensor type will result in a need to redesign the existing stations to accommodate the new sensor. <br />&bull; CO-OPS cannot risk the possibility of new mounting hardware to be developed and purchased to mount a new sensor.<br />&bull; The data collection platforms at CO-OPS stations are programmed to collect data from the RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors. If a new sensor is implemented additional cost for software development will be required. <br />&bull; Currently CO-OPS field personal and contractors are trained in the use and maintenance of the RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors. Additional cost will incur from having to train field personal and contractors on the use and maintenance of a new sensor. <br />&bull; Using another type of sensor will require the purchase of additional equipment so that the field crews can support multiple sensor types in a given region.<br />&bull; CO-OPS also has the ability and necessary equipment to calibrate and repair the RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors. If a new sensor is implemented new equipment for that sensor will need to be purchased and training will be needed for those tasked with this duty.</p>

A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<p>Name Brand Justification for RM Young Wind Monitors Model 05103-45</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">The RM Young Model 05103-45 Wind Monitors are the standard wind monitoring sensors used at CO-OPS environmental monitoring stations on the Atlantic coast above the Mason-Dixon Line, in the Great Lakes, and Alaska.</span> Implementing different sensors in place of the current sensors will result in additional cost and resources. Also, there will be resulting delay for testing, training, and purchase of support equipment. <br />&bull; Under the current CO-OPS operating system any environmental monitoring sensor that has not been previously approved must be subjected to a series of tests to ensure the quality of the data produced by that sensor and the durability of that sensor for the intended use. These tests usually include bench testing using controlled conditions and physical measurement, controlled environmental testing to check a sensor's reliability under different conditions, and long term comparison testing with accepted sensors at multiple real world locations. These tests and the analysis of the resulting data take a large amount of time, money, and resources to conduct. <br />&bull; The RM Young Model&nbsp;05103-45 Wind Monitors are tied to a series of data collection software and existing infrastructure and are replacements in kind due to a high consumable rate as a result of where they are positioned on piers, buoys, etc.<br />&bull; CO-OPS stations are designed for optimal performance of the RM Young Model 05103-45 Wind Monitors. A change of sensor type will result in a need to redesign the existing stations to accommodate the new sensor. <br />&bull; CO-OPS cannot risk the possibility of new mounting hardware to be developed and purchased to mount a new sensor.<br />&bull; The data collection platforms at CO-OPS stations are programmed to collect data from the RM Young Model 05103-45 Wind Monitors. If a new sensor is implemented additional cost for software development will be required. <br />&bull; Currently CO-OPS field personal and contractors are trained in the use and maintenance of the RM Young Model 05103-45 Wind Monitors. Additional cost will incur from having to train field personal and contractors on the use and maintenance of a new sensor. <br />&bull; Using another type of sensor will require the purchase of additional equipment so that the field crews can support multiple sensor types in a given region.<br />&bull; CO-OPS also has the ability and necessary equipment to calibrate and repair the RM Young Model 05103-45 Wind Monitors. If a new sensor is implemented new equipment for that sensor will need to be purchased and training will be needed for those tasked with this duty.</p>

<ARCHDATE>03312009
<CONTACT>Michael King, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-baa-09-02@ugov.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">DESCRIPTION: The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is seeking ideas for innovative research and technology demonstrations for Biometrics Exploitation Science and Technology (BEST) to significantly advance the state of the science and enable revolutionary advances in algorithms, devices, and/or systems for non-contact biometrics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />A Proposer's Day will be held on 15 January 2009, 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm, at the MITRE 1 Auditorium (7525 Colshire Drive, McLean, VA) for the IARPA BEST Program.  The Proposer's Day does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts.  Attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to subsequent Broad Agency Announcements (if any) on this topic.  IARPA anticipates releasing a BAA sometime after the Proposer's Day.  IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this Proposer's Day.  Pre-registration for Proposer's Day is required via the website at http://conference.brtrc.com/best09/. Attendees are limited to a maximum of two representatives per company, organization or institution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />The BEST program consists of two main thrusts: (1) Exploitation and Analysis and (2) Robust Acquisition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />The Exploitation and Analysis research thrust is composed of three tracks which bound the biometric signatures of interest: 1) face recognition, 2) ocular recognition (i.e. iris recognition with proximal skin texture), and 3) speaker recognition. The thrust seeks to investigate techniques to derive and exploit biometric signatures from data collected under relaxed acquisition constraints while maintaining recognition performance similar to data acquired under controlled conditions. Given that data may originate from a variety of sources, techniques must operate without prior knowledge regarding characteristics of the sensor used during the acquisition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Robust Acquisition research thrust seeks to relax the constraints to enable the collection of high fidelity (1) 3D face (shape and texture) and (2) coupled face and ocular biometric features at standoff distance under uncontrolled acquisition conditions to enable the broader application of the technology. Representative acquisition constraints to be relaxed include, but are not limited to, subject motion, relative position to the sensor, and environmental influences. The minimum objective is to exceed by a factor of three what is commercially available today, with recognition performance similar to that achieved with the cooperative or conditioned individual under controlled acquisition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Technologies that are not of interest to BEST are contact-type biometric technologies (i.e. fingerprint, palm, etc.) and ideas for product development or research that would primarily result in incremental, evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The goals of this Proposer's Day are to 1) familiarize participants with IARPA's interest in biometrics technologies; 2) promote an understanding of the BAA proposal submission requirements and process; and 3) foster discussion of synergistic capabilities among potential program participants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />REGISTRATION INFORMATION: If interested in attending proposer's day, please visit the registration website (http://conference.brtrc.com/best09/) and complete the form necessary to request an invitation. Non-US citizens are required to fill out a visit request form for Foreign Nationals. The registration deadline is 07 January 2009. If approved, you will be sent an invitation to attend.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />INVITED INFORMATION: Attendees may hand out background materials regarding potential technology that may be applicable at the Proposer's Day, however, there will not be an opportunity for formal presentations. All handout materials must be unclassified and approved in advance by the organization that funded the research. No proprietary information should be included.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />POINTS OF CONTACT: <br />TECHNICAL: Dr. Michael King, IARPA BEST Program Manager, <br />dni-iarpa-baa-09-02@ugov.gov</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">EVENT COORDINATION: Ms. Virginia Hoover (Contractor), IARPA BEST09 Proposer's Day Liaison, vhoover@brtrc.com.</p>
