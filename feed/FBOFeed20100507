<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals of interest to the Transformational Convergence Technology Office (TCTO). Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems. Specifically excluded is research that results primarily in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of the art.
<p>DARPA broad agency announcements (BAAs) are posted on the FedBizOpps website (https://www.fedbizopps.gov/) and Grants.gov website (http://www.grants.gov/).</p>
<p>TCTO seeks unconventional approaches that are outside the mainstream, undertaking directions that challenge assumptions and have the potential to radically change established practice.</p>
<p>TCTO collaborates with other DARPA program offices, in some cases acting as the recipient of significant emerging technologies and, in other cases, serving as a catalyst by identifying relevant new external technology trends. Novel methods are sought to build technical communities and tap into sources of innovation both inside and outside traditional DoD performer communities. TCTO sponsors programs that involve interdisciplinary research leading to realistic demonstrations.</p>
<p>Solicitations are sought in the following areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Analysis, modeling, and prediction in complex networks, including (but not limited to) social networks, encompassing concepts such as crowd-sourcing, strategic communications, and quantitative social and behavioral sciences</p>
<p>&bull; Engineered biosynthesis of novel materials and objects, including synthetic biology, biosynthesis of chemicals and materials, biosensors, bioengineering, and novel approaches to material manufacture</p>
<p>&bull; Non-human intelligence concepts as applied to robots, animals, and other collaborative systems including sensing, training, architectures, and novel automated systems</p>
<p>&bull; Resilient computing systems concepts including robust, evolvable, widely available, high-performance computing systems and networks, and new approaches to cyber defense and cyber-resilience</p>
<p>&bull; Mobilization of communities to address important national and international problems, including incentive schemes and potential educational applications</p>
<p>&bull; Challenges and open competitions to advance science and engineering in Defense-related areas</p>
<p>Potential proposers unfamiliar with the BAA process are encouraged to consider the submission of an abstract describing the idea, as discussed in section IV B 1.</p>

It should be noted that this installation observes strict security procedures to enter the facility. These security procedures are NOT considered an interruption of normal Government processes, and proposals received after the above stated date and time as a result of security delays will be considered "late."

Alternative contract types may be considered if the Offeror can assure the government that the risk can be managed in such a way that the objectives of the program are met and in what circumstances they have successfully used them in the past.

<p><br />Full Text Announcement</p>
<p><br />I. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The Secretary of the Air Force Office of Small Business Programs is soliciting white papers (and later technical and cost proposals) open to eligible mentors and prot&eacute;g&eacute;s to provide the Air Force a strong technical component or innovative state of the art technology that will meet Air Force mission requirements.</p>
<p>1. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this Department of Defense (DoD) program is to provide incentives to prime DoD contractors to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of the prot&eacute;g&eacute; firms to satisfy DoD and other contract and subcontract requirements. This is accomplished by technical and developmental assistance from the mentor to the prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Under this program, approved mentor firms will enter into Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; (MP) agreements with eligible prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. A complete description of the DoD program and eligibility requirements is provided in Appendix I of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). In addition, you can visit the Air Force Small Business Website at www.AirForceSmallBiz.org to obtain detailed Air Force MP Program information and Support Programs linked to the MP Program. Proposed agreements consisting primarily of business infrastructure, management and marketing assistance will not be considered for approval. The Air Force solicits MP agreements that are in line with the Air Force Vision and Priority areas while delivering requirements that contain a strong technical component or focus on innovative state of the art technology. The Air Force's mission is to Fly, Fight and Win in Air Space and Cyberspace. The Air Force priorities are listed below: <br />AIR FORCE PRIORITY AREAS:</p>
<p>Reinvigorate the Nuclear Enterprise<br />Partner with the Joint Coalition Team to Win Today's Fight<br />Develop and Care for Airmen and Their Families<br />Modernize Our Air and Space Inventories, organization and Trainings<br />Acquisition Excellence</p>

<p><br />2. APPROACH: The Air Force District of Washington Acquisition Division (AFDW/A7KS) intends to fund Air Force Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements by issuing a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract and may award without discussion.

If proposed mentoring efforts require a second option year, justification of the additional year shall be provided in the WHITE PAPER.

<p>4. Second Step Proposal Instructions:</p>
<p>a. General: The SECOND STEP consists of successful Offerors submitting a technical and cost proposal within 30 calendar days of the proposed request sent by the Contracting Officer. After receipt, proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the award criteria in Section V. Offerors should apply the restrictive notice prescribed in the provision FAR 52.215-1(e) Instructions to Offerors- Competitive Acquisition. Technical/management and cost volumes should be submitted in separate volumes and must be valid for 120 days. Proposals must reference the announcement number BAA 10-01. The cost of preparing proposals in response to the Request for Proposals is not considered an allowable direct cost to any resulting or any other contract; however, it may be allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner with reasoning for non-selection.

The page limitation covers all information including indices, photographs, foldouts (counted as 1 page for each 8.5 by 11 portion) tables, charts, appendices, attachments, resumes, etc.<br />(7) Due to continuing attempts by numerous Offerors to obtain an unfair advantage by failing to conform to the formatting rules above, the Government will check the proposal for conformance to the stated requirements.

<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) intends to negotiate and award a non-competitive contract to Phoenix Air Group, Inc. (PAG), located in Cartersville, GA. The above is being done in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), other than full and open competition, as only one (1) responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Agency's requirements. Presently, PAG provides an airborne broadcast platform referred to as "AeroMarti" with installed U.S. Government television transmission systems that are operational utilizing two (2) PAG-owned Grumman Gulfstream I turboprop aircraft. PAG had an instrumental role and provided expert services in the development and operation the AeroMarti airborne TV broadcast platform. Under a Task Order to an Army contract, which was awarded on July 28, 2006 and expires completely on May 31, 2010, PAG has provided the necessary air services to AeroMarti and has become fully aware of the complex operational and technical challenges associated with maintaining the AeroMarti schedule, which includes 6 days a-week airborne television broadcasting. This includes the operations of the onboard broadcast system in compliance with FCC Memorandum Opinion and Order No. 95-160, dated April 28, 1995, that mandates that the Agency maintain a "directional" TV signal broadcast to insure no objectionable interference to any domestic FCC licensee.

PAG shall be responsible for conducting all directed AeroMarti broadcast missions, perform all necessary aircraft maintenance, and submit a variety of monthly reports that will address actual flight hours, cost reimbursable charges, daily fueling reports, receipts, and summaries. Interested sources shall have prior demonstrated and documented experience in delivering to (or providing) an international broadcast operation with high powered television directional antenna systems required by AeroMarti for the U.S. Government. Interested firms shall identify their business size (i.e., small, large, etc.) and submit a comprehensive written "Capabilities Statement" that is verifiable by the BBG in order to determine if the interested source is responsive to this notice. The "Capabilities Statement" must include, at the minimum, the following: (1) Evidence of specific examples of the Contractor's successful PAST PERFORMANCE, (2) with a minimum of five (5) years experience in providing specialized TV Air Services support; (3) SAMPLE PROJECT PLAN to include, but not limited to; an operations and maintenance schedule, on-site list of materials, aircraft support equipment, description of activities performed, and a budgetary estimate, (4) PAST PROJECTS: within last two (2) year's list the project title, city, state, country, customer's name, contract type, total contract amount, contract start and completion dates, summary of the description of the specialized TV air services, (5) REFERENCES: provide the names and title, current address, city, state, country, email and telephone number of the customer point-of-contact, (6) TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE: The Contractor shall clearly describe their ability to provide specialized TV air services support and submit appropriate technical documentation describing the ability of all proposed team members for the above, (7) AIRCRAFT: provide evidence of having immediate access to the required Grumman Gulfstream I turboprop aircraft, and (8) Those interested may specify a description or listing of specific information that they would require for the above.

<CONTACT>Joseph A. Bednar, Contracting Officer, Phone 2699617546, Fax 2699614417, Email joe.bednar@dla.mil
<DESC>This action is to announce the upcoming placement of multiple Blank Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for tire disposal requirements at military installations across the continental United States (CONUS).  The action is 100% set-aside for small business entities with a NAICs code of 562219, and the corresponding revenue standard is $12,500,000.00.

A proposed BPA will be posted on or about 14 May 10, with instructions as to what interested firms must submit to be considered as one of the multiple BPA holders.  In general, the purpose of the BPAs is to cover the necessary Performance Work Statement (PWS) and other pertinent contract terms related to the removal, transportation, and disposal of tires from various military installations in CONUS, with the specific sites and states to be covered on actual orders under the BPAs.   DRMS intends to maintain multiple BPAs with eligible firms providing the necessary tire disposal services in CONUS, with the actual order requirements competed among the firms via informal Requests for Quotations (RFQs) issued to the BPA holders.   Contractors holding one of these BPAs are not required to quote on all RFQs issued during the period of the BPA, they may choose to pursue only the orders that suit their location, capabilities and interest.  Contractors agree by entering a BPA that the BPA itself is not a commitment by the Government to purchase these services from the contractor.  The actual Government obligation to purchase the services, and the Contractor’s actual obligation to perform the specific services, is only established via  orders issued under the BPA.

Questions concerning this action will be invited when the proposed BPA is posted on or about 14 May 10, along with instructions on what is to be submitted to be eligible to hold a BPA for these tire disposal requirements.

At the same time, the John Glenn Research Center has the charter ofperforming research in the area of Emissions Technology.  Other technologies, such as GPSReradiators, add to the many potential interference sources, some of which can spoofGNSS signals.  In order to protect GNSS signals specific expertise is required in theareas of effects of interference and signal degradation.  2) ITU-R Working Party 4CSupport, ITU-R working Party 4C has been tasked for generating ITU-R Recommendationsproviding technical characteristics and protection criteria for Radionavigation-SatelliteService systems used in interference studies.  Technical characteristics includetechnical descriptions of GNSS receivers performing various functions, and thedescription of the evaluation of the effects of interference on GNSS receiver performanceof these functions.  The description of these technical characteristics requiressignificant expertise in GNSS, especially in the area of GNSS receiver technology. 3).New National and International GPS/GNSS Navigation Signals, GPS is in process ofmodernization.	One aspect of this modernization is the addition of new civil signalsthat would enhance the performance of GPS for civil users.  In addition, newinternational GNSS systems are evolving (Galileo, COMPASS, QZNS, and IRNSS) and others(GLONASS) are improving.  The US DoD has the lead role in GPS modernization andcoordinating with the international systems, but other US Government agencies, includingNASA, represent civil users in the evaluation of the new civil signals and compatibilityof the international system signals with GPS civil signals.  4) Department of CommercePlan to Determine the Emission Limits Necessary to Protect Spectrum use by U.S. SpaceBased Positioning, Navigation and Timing, Augmentation and support SystemsThe Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with A.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to re-compete a requirement currently being performed by BioReliance Inc. under NIA Contract HHSN260200600004C. This procurement is being competed under full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541712. It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, term type contract will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about March 1, 2011, with an anticipated level of effort of approximately 1/2 FTE in each year, to develop, maintain and distribute a repository of tissues from aged rodents for use by investigators in studies of aging.
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) supports through contracts several colonies of aged rats and mice for use in research on aging. Some investigators do not need live animals, but simply collect specific tissue from the animals for their experiments. The purpose of this contract is to provide a source of fresh-frozen tissue, suitable for multiple experimental protocols, from the NIA colonies of aged rats and mice. This will allow multiple investigators to make use of different tissues from the same animals, and will lower the cost of tissue for those investigators. <br /><br />The Contractor shall receive mice and rats selected by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) from the NIA colonies and shipped at no cost to the Contractor, and shall upon receipt of the animals assign an identification number to each animal, record vital statistics, and collect, flash-freeze, package, label and store tissues, and ship tissues to investigators at the direction of the COTR. The number of animals to be sent for tissue collection each year is dependent on need. It is estimated that 150 animals per year shall be received by the Contractor, in groups of 5 animals per week. The COTR shall determine the specific strain, age and gender of the animals to be sent, as well as the schedule for submission of animals for tissue collection.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall transfer the existing aged rodent tissue bank holdings from the existing contract to the Contractor's facilities. The transfer shall be accomplished in such away to prevent any thawing of frozen tissues. The current contract aged rodent tissue bank consists of approximately 6,600 frozen tissue samples in two freezers and 500 glass slides stored at room temperature.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the animals, the Contractor shall maintain them for three days under conditions where they will not be exposed to disease or other animals. Animals shall be maintained in filtered cages, no more than 3 rats or 5 mice per cage, with ad libitum food and water, a temperature range of 70-75oF and a 12/12 hour light/dark cycle. NIH31 laboratory diet (Rader et al., 1986, J. Nutrition 116:1777-88) shall be autoclaved, water shall be autoclaved, and cage <br /><br />bedding shall be autoclaved. Cages shall meet ILAR minimum floor space requirements per animals and population size as stated in NIH publication No. 85-23 entitled "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals" (text available at http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/labrats/ ).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall record on the Vital Statistics Information Sheet the date of accession, strain, gender, age, weight, barrier of origin, special notes such as caloric restricted, and general condition including visible lesions. The Contractor shall euthanize each animal individually by CO2 asphyxiation and immediately collect, freeze and store the following tissues (flash-frozen in LN2 and stored at -70 to -80oC): serum, brain, eyes, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, ovary or testes, pancreas, small intestine, prostate, muscle, skin, kidneys, white adipose tissue, thymus and any tumors found. The Contractor shall provide immersion fixation of tissues with ethanol or formalin for special cases designated by the COTR in order to meet the needs of NIA-funded projects and to prepare tissue arrays. Tissues fixed for investigators' special requests shall be stored at room temperature or at 4oC as instructed by the COTR, and shipped to the investigator in the fixative. Tissues fixed for tissue arrays shall be embedded in paraffin and arrays prepared at the direction of the COTR. Master blocks of tissue arrays are prepared and sectioned onto glass slides (1" x 3"), and stored at room temperature. It is estimated that one (1) tissue array will be made per year. The Contractor shall use an appropriate mechanism for inventory control of frozen tissue, fixed tissue, embedded tissue, and tissue arrays. The Contractor shall maintain frozen tissues in two freezers, each of which is equipped with an independent alarm system and back-up generator. Approximately half of each sample cohort of tissue (same strain, age, gender) shall be maintained in each freezer.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ship tissues and tissue arrays to investigators at the direction of the COTR, and invoice the investigator for the cost of shipping the tissue and a nominal fee set by the COTR.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

NAICS code: 562111; Small business size standard: $12.5 Million. This solicitation is subject to the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program and is subject to full and open competition. All responsible business concerns may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the National Park Service (NPS). The anticipated award date is approximately the middle of June, 2010.

2)     SCOPE OF WORK:
Yellowstone National Park requires the following requirements for this acquisition:  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.
IntroductionYellowstone National Park (YNP) has a very mature recycling program that continues to grow and expand every year. The program services over three million visitors annually, as well as over 5000 employees during the peak summer season. The park currently collects glass, aluminum/steel, cardboard, paper, as well as specialty items; such as one pound propane cylinders and bear spray canisters.  In 2009, the park generated over 4,000 tons of waste-80% of which was diverted from the landfill. This was accomplished through recycling, composting and various waste stream diversion initiatives.  The program is very challenging, due to the fact that the park encompasses over 3,400 square miles with elevations over 11,000 feet, and experiences severe climate and frequent road closures. Additionally, Yellowstone is home to over 600 grizzly bears, 400 black bears, and 100 wolves that all must be managed by natural regulation. This means that aggressive measures to minimize wildlife habituation near recycling collection points must be strictly enforced.
Scope of workThis request for proposal encompasses all activities/equipment associated with the collection and transport of commodities from within the boundaries of YNP. Those commodities include:"	Paper-all types, magazines, office pack, newspapers, slicks, phone books, etc"	Cardboard-Both corrugated and non-corrugated types"	Plastics-#1 through #7, bubble wrap, shrink wrap, grocery sacks, etc"	Aluminum/steel-All types"	Glass-All types and colors"	One pound propane cylinders"	Bear Spray canistersYellowstone National Park has a very seasonal operation that requires the contractor to be flexible and adaptive to weather/climate factors and visitation fluctuations. During the period from May 1st through Nov. 1st, the contractor will be responsible for the collection and transport of all commodities from all areas of the park (see attachment #1). During the period from Nov. 1st through April 31st, the contractor will be responsible for the Mammoth Hot Springs and Tower Junction areas only. These dates may vary slightly and the National Park Service (NPS) determines exact fall/spring dates accordingly.
The park currently has 98 collection bins that must be utilized by the contractor for the recycling program. The bins are fabricated with heavy gauge metal to be "bear proof" and the design allows for a crane to elevate the bins to be emptied into a larger storage container through a cable system that allows for the bottom of the bin to be released for empting. The current inventory of bins is as follows:"	52- 2 yard bins"	44- 4 yard bins"	2- 8 yard binsThis proposal includes the establishment of four major collection points within the park:"	Mammoth Hot Springs-minimum of 40 yard bin capacity for the storage of commodities"	Canyon Village-same storage requirements"	Lake Village-same storage requirements"	Old Faithful-same storage requirements
The contractor is responsible for the painting of all bins in accordance with YNP standards and for supplying all standardized signage for all bins. This signing shall be reviewed by park personnel for approval, including the international symbol for recycling. All new bins will be fabricated to be bear proof and be maintained by the contractor.
The following are the proposed locations for the placement of recycling bins. Please request attachment #2 from the Contracting Officer for a summary of types/quantities of commodities collected. "	Mammoth Hot Springs-year round service with multiple sites within the area"	Tower Junction- year round service"	Canyon Village-seasonal service with two sites (major campground)"	Lake Village-seasonal service with multiple sites (Fishing Bridge, Lake, Bridge Bay Marina, Bridge Bay campground)"	Grant Village-seasonal service with two sites (major campground)"	*East Entrance-seasonal service "	*South Entrance-seasonal service"	Old Faithful-seasonal service with multiple sites"	Madison Junction-seasonal service with two sites (major campground)"	Norris Junction-seasonal service with multiple sites (campground)"	West Entrance-seasonal service"	*Northeast Entrance-year round service (includes Lamar Valley Buffalo Ranch)*Indicates a new location not currently serviced
The contractor will work closely with park personnel to ensure collection points are maintained and kept clean. The contractor must respond within 24 hours of being notified of over-flowing bins, broken equipment, etc. 
The NPS will retain ownership of all 98 bins currently in place and the contractor shall provide all additional collection bins and provide signage for all bins within the park. The park shall pay a leasing fee for all collection bins required beyond the 98 bins currently in place. The contractor will assume ownership of all commodities once they leave park boundaries. The following is a summary of commodities collected in 2009:
Aluminum/steel-14.1 tonsCardboard-269.5 tonsGlass-177.8 tonsPaper (all types)-86.4Plastics-41.2Propane cylinders- 15,000 one pound cylinders (transport only)

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) intends to procure and award, on an other than full and open competition basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, A Fixed Price contract with MTS Systems Corporation, EdenPrairie, MN for a custom high speed servohydraulic test system, test system accessories, installation, and training.  The new servohydraulic system must be located in a building that is capable of testing energetic materials, has the necessary electrical power and water line access to operate the pump and allow the necessary users convenient access to allow work to be performed without delays in testing.  The only location that meets the above requirements already houses an MTS servohydraulic test system.  Because of the size of the test system and pump it is necessary to share the pump to be able to house both test systems in the room together.  The pump and the pump logic used to control the pump are both proprietary to MTS.  MTS is the only source capable of providing a servohydraulic test system due to the proprietary nature of the pump and pump logic and the space constraints within the building.  Anticipated award is September 2010 or earlier and required delivery will be 2 months after award.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firms believing they can fulfill the requirement may submit a written response which shall be considered by the agency.  The written response shall reference solicitation number N68936-10-R-0050 and clearly show the firm's capability, background, experience and assets necessary to perform the required work mentioned above without compromising the quality, accuracy, reliability, and delivery of the product.  Written responses shall be submitted by email to robert.charlon@navy.mil or mailed to Commander, Code 254100D (Robert Charlon), NAVAIRWARCENWPNDIV, 429 E.

<DESC>This is not a request for a quote, proposal or an invitation for bid, but is intended to serve as a pre-solicitation synopsis. The project will be solicited using the simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13. The contract resulting from this solicitation will result in contract award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government.
The project will be to analyze Joint Region Marianas (JRM) facility inventory and provide various cost effective techniques that will assist with energy conservation/reduction.  The deliverable is a decision support tool with the capability of assessing conservation actions and techniques utilizing an interactive database. The proposed project involves analyzing the energy consumption of various JRM facilities by type and use, providing different options for reducing energy consumption (e.g. lighting, thermostat settings, HVAC improvements, etc.) with preliminary cost estimates to analyze the cost effectiveness of each option.  Since these options have to work cumulatively, an interactive decision support model must be constructed that will allow the user to choose the cumulative program that reaches the conservation goals based on a given budget.  This tool is meant to be used as a planning tool and therefore the indicators can be refined as detailed engineering analysis is performed on specific buildings.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCEUnder the authority of 6.302-1, the Naval War College, College of Distance Education intends to award as sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract to Professors to Go.  Under the authority of USC 2304(c) (1) pursuant to FAR 6.202-1(a) (2), the product or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract is based on market research and is solely within the discretion of the government.  Even though a Firm-Fixed Price/Sole Source Contract is anticipated interested firms or persons may identify their interest and capability to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Amy Skwira (401) 841-3628, Email: amy.skwira@usnwc.edu.  A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES

The courses are essentially the same as taught in residence at Newport, with the CDE resident faculty preparing the course syllabus, procuring teaching materials, and funding administrative expenses.  Because the site of the course is removed from the Naval War College it is necessary to contract individuals who reside in the areas listed above to serve as instructors and local administrators for the courses.  
The qualifications for this position are unique in that they require a combination of professional education, joint and naval warfare operational experience, familiarity with the Naval War College missions and functions, and experience and competence in teaching the NWC curriculum at the graduate level using the NWC methodology. The following Knowledge, Skills and Abilities specific to each course apply:
 	Strategy & War Course:       		Ph.D. in Military History, History, Political Science, or International Relations - DesiredJoint Professional Military Education Phase 1 - DesiredTeaching experience in an accredited institution of higher education - DesiredPrior military experience in any Service or grade - Desired			Joint Maritime Operations Course:Masters Degree or Higher - RequiredJoint Professional Military Education Phase 1 - Highly Desired	Joint and Naval Warfare Operational Experience - RequiredGraduate of Senior Services College - Required      	Previous military experience at the rank of 05 or above - Required	 National Security Decision Making Course:		Ph.D. in International Relations; National Security Affairs - PreferredMA/MS - MinimumJoint Professional Military Education Phase 1 - DesiredPrior military experience at rank of 05 or above - Desired and PreferredGraduate of a Senior Service College - Desired

PROCEDURE FOR SOLICITATION/AWARDA written Request for Quote #N00124-10-Q-0243 (Form SF1449) will be issued 3-5 business days after this Synopsis posting.  Interested parties may obtain a copy of this SF1449 from the FEDBizOps or NECO website or by contacting  Ms. Amy Skwira at amy.skwira@usnwc.edu.   Even though the intent is for a sole source contract, all responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  The Government will award a firm fixed price (GSA Task Order or Purchase Order) resulting from this Request for Quote to the responsible offeror whose quotation represents the Best Value to the government.  Evaluation factors to be considered will be cost/price, experience, and past performance.   The government considers Experience/Past Performance to be more important than price.  However, the government will not select an offeror for award on the basis of relatively superior capability without concern for cost /price.  The relative impact the Experience/Past Performance and price will have on the source selection decision will depend, in part, on the degree of differences among the competing offerors.
The Line Items on the Request for Quote may be segregated into smaller requirements for the purpose of awarding more than one contract.  Therefore vendors are encouraged to quote on either all or some of the line items listed on this RFQ.  It will be up to the discretion of the contracting officer whether or not issuing multiple segregated contracts will be in the best interest of the government.
The award date is estimated to be no later than 25 June 2010.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be issuing an Invitation for Bid for Maintenance Dredging.  The proposed work consists of maintenance dredging of the 15-foot Federal entrance channel at Newburyport Harbor.  The work consists of dredging about 160,000 cubic yards (cy) of sand to a required depth of 16 feet, plus a 1-foot overdepth allowance to 17 feet.  About 120,000 cy will be placed on Plum Island Beach in Newbury, about 1  miles away; and disposal of about 40,000 cy will be on Salisbury Beach in Salisbury, about 1  miles away.  The dredged material can be removed using either an ocean-certified cutterhead pipeline dredge or an ocean-certified hopper dredge with pump-out capability.  Depending on equipment used, a booster pump may be required.  The dredged material placed on the beach will be used to increase the elevation and width of the beach berm and widen the frontal dune line.  The new dune face would be planted with grass and sand fencing installed.  Dredging and disposal window is from September 1 to March 31.  Dredging operations will be permitted 24 hours per day and 7 days per week.  The entrance channel was last dredged in 1999 when approximately 145,000 cy were removed.  The estimated cost of this procurement is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. A pre-bid conference will be held at the New England District, Concord, MA and is currently scheduled for Tuesday, February 16, 2010 at 10:00 am in the New England Conference Room.  Additional details and registration requirements will be included in the solicitation documents.  This solicitation will be available on or about 4 February 2010 and will be available for downloading by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov). Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests will be accepted. Registrants are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the registration list. This procurement is UNRESTRICTED.

Selected efforts will encompass the initiation of the Technology Development (TD) Phase of the DoD Acquisition System and will specifically address development of a therapeutic(s) for DR-PTSD indications from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 5 through completion of all requirements in TRL 8, as defined by the Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) Deskbook in Appendix H, which can be downloaded at: <BR>http://www.dod.mil/ddre/doc/May2005_TRA_2005_DoD.pdf <BR><BR>The objective is to determine whether a pharmacological intervention strategy to treat Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) service members and veterans with DR-PTSD can demonstrate safety and effectiveness, while ensuring an acceptable risk-benefit ratio.  For the purpose of this RFP, DR-PTSD refers to any service member with a diagnosis of PTSD incurred while on active duty status and is in any of the stages of the OEF/OIF deployment cycle (i.e., Train-up/Preparation, Mobilization, Deployment, Employment, Redeployment, Post-Deployment, and Reconstitution).  DR- PTSD also refers to OEF/OIF veterans diagnosed with PTSD who are not presently on active duty (e.g., retired, discharged, reserve status, etc.), but deployed at least once to OEF/OIF.<BR>Research Focus Areas of Interest: <BR><BR>Area of Interest 1: <BR><BR>Pharmacological treatment of OEF/OIF service members/veterans with DR-PTSD in duration of one year or less.<BR><BR> Area of Interest 2: <BR><BR>Pharmacological intervention for DR-PTSD prophylaxis among:<BR><BR>a.	OEF/OIF service members/veterans who experienced a traumatic event consistent with the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) criterion A1 (but not necessarily criterion A2) for PTSD who are experiencing distressing symptoms, but do not yet meet full criteria for PTSD.<BR><BR>b.   OEF/OIF service members/veterans immediately after experiencing an A1 event consistent with DSM-IV criterion A1 (but not necessarily criterion A2) for PTSD.<BR><BR>Area of Interest 3: <BR><BR>Development of novel pharmacological treatment for OEF/OIF service members/veterans with DR-PTSD of duration that is more than one year.<BR><BR>Area of Interest 4: <BR><BR>Efficacy determination of off-label and/or FDA-licensed drugs frequently used to treat PTSD among OEF/OIF service members/veterans, but having limited, or no, empiric evidence of efficacy (e.g., benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, etc.).<BR><BR>Area of Interest 5: <BR><BR>Comparative effectiveness drug studies among OEF/OIF service members/veterans using drugs with established and/or putative efficacy in treating DR-PTSD. (e.g., alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, atypical antipsychotics, etc.).<BR><BR>NOTE: <BR><BR>There is increased interest in expanding the armamentarium of evidence-based medications available to manage selected prominent symptoms of DR-PTSD, such as sleep disturbance or impulsive aggression, as well as to treat PTSD symptoms more broadly.  This RFP invites studies designed to establish efficacy data of medication effects on specific target symptoms or clusters of symptoms, as long as there is a convincing rationale for this approach.<BR><BR>The Government herein reserves the right to issue one contract or multiple contracts based on a best value determination.  Any resulting award will be issued as a performance based acquisition with a base period of performance of 2 years with 3 one-year options.  A cost-type contract is anticipated.  The Contractor will be responsible for providing all resources necessary to perform.<BR><BR><BR>

<CONTACT>Robert L. Nadeau, Contracting Officer, Phone 310 653-1591, Email robert.nadeau@us.af.mil
<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW), Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA intends to modify the existing SLRS contract with ITT, Corporation, Systems Division, 1030 South Highway A1A, Bldg 989, Patrick AFB, FL 32925 to extend the period of performance to allow for continued sustainment of the Eastern and Western Ranges until the follow-on contract is awarded. SLRS contract provides the sustainment and Instrumentation Modernization (IM) upgrades to the Eastern Range (ER) and Western Range (WR) communications, telemetry, and command and control systems located at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Vandenberg Air Force Base respectively.
<p>Allowing continued sustainment under the SLRS contract until Launch Test Range System (LTRS) Integrated Support Contract (LISC) is awarded will prevent unacceptable delays in critical range National priority space launches. The follow-on contract (LISC) is anticipated to provide range operation services, maintenance and upgrade of both ER and WR. Currently, the LISC acquisition strategy is in development with an anticipated award date of late FY11. However, until the follow-on contract is awarded, SLRSC must sustain the ranges. The contract modification will include several short-term sustainment option CLINS to allow for extension of the SLRS contract until the award of the follow-on contract.</p>
<p>This action is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S. C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." While this notice of intent is for information purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties including small and small disadvantaged businesses may identify their interest and technical capability, and submit information which shall be considered by the agency. Interested parties must show capability to fulfill Government's immediate, short-term need for the effort described above. The notice expires 15 days after publication.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this effort is 541712 and the Small Business Size Standard is 1000 employees. Capabilities information may be emailed to Mr. Robert Nadeau, Contracting Officer, at Robert.nadeau@losangeles.af.mil.</p>

Introduction
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) was established in 1863 as a bureau of the Department of the Treasury. It is responsible for regulating and supervising the national banking system. The OCC charters, regulates and examines approximately 2,200 national banks and 52 federal branches and agencies of foreign banks in the United States.  Its mission is to ensure a safe, sound and competitive national banking system that supports the citizens, communities and economy of the United States.
The OCC is investigating vendor interest and capability in providing “off-the-shelf” interactive Capital Markets and Operational Risk (Basle) e-learning.  The vendor must be able to provide these courses to be accessed using OCC’s desktop configuration and systems.  These basic self-study courses should also contain modules, exercises, and knowledge tests/skill checks that can be administered and reviewed centrally by CE staff with appropriate summary reports.  The vendor shall provide ongoing technical support, maintenance and any course and content upgrades for the life of the contract. The term of the contract will include a base year plus four option years.

OCC may solicit some, all, or none of the respondents for the proposed requirement described herein.  
Background
OCC examiners require the ability to access basic capital markets courses in an on-line environment.  Currently, the OCC offers capital markets e-learning solutions that cover the basics of finance, statistical theory and portfolio management in three self studies - capital markets, bond math, and portfolio risk management.  The OCC wishes to continue to provide to its examiners such capital markets self-study courses.  Additionally, the OCC is seeking e-learning solutions that cover Operational Risk as addressed by Basle Accord.

Also, an on-line course addressing Operational Risk and Operational Risk management as it relates to all financial institutions as well as Operational Risk as defined by the Basle Accord; is desired for OCC examiners.  This course would also seek to provide learning on an attendant Operational Risk related topic on how financial institutions embrace a robust and sustainable enterprise risk management process to include the build out of sound technological infrastructures.
Each course would be suitable for a particular examiner audience and contain an appropriate level of complexity based on the bank category.   The vendor or vendors would be responsible for ensuring that any e-learning courses are compatible and functional with OCC systems.

Its mission is to ensure a safe, sound and competitive national banking system that supports the citizens, communities and economy of the United States.

These examiners support the supervision of capital markets, trading, and investment portfolio activities in the complex community, mid-size and large national banks.  
This training will bring those examiners to the higher level of expertise needed for the OCC to fulfill its supervisory objectives.

Each course would be suitable for a particular examiner audience and contain an appropriate level of complexity based on the bank category.   Most courses would be up to a week in duration with the schedule to be determined by the OCC.  The vendor will provide constant feedback during the course regarding exercises and team results.

<p>Description<br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide a Q-5000 IR-Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA).<br />This requirement is needed to upgrade the current TGA.</p>
<p>Contractor will be required to provide the HIV-1 P24 Kits that have the following salient characteristics:<br />1. Temperature Range: The TGA instrument should allow for a measurable temperature range of ambient to 1200&deg;C.</p>
<p>2. Heating Rate Range: As this instrument will be used for kinetics analyses, a wide range of achievable heating rates is critical. The instrument should be able to control heating rates between 0.1 and 500 &deg;C/min with noise levels over 10&deg;C no greater than &plusmn;0.01&deg;C/min (unsmoothed).</p>
<p>3. Balance Sensitivity: The TGA balance should have a sensitivity of at least 0.1 &#61549;g and a baseline drift of &lt; 10 &#61549;g over the temperature range ambient &rarr; 1000&deg;C (uncorrected) in either air or N2 atmosphere. The TGA isothermal baseline drift should not be more than 5 &#61549;g over 18 hours.</p>
<p>4. Cooling Time: Since the machine will be used extensively, it is important that the furnace cooling time be less than 10 minutes from 1000oC to 50oC.</p>
<p>5. Purge Gas Control: The TGA should include digital mass flow controllers for at least two separate purge gases, such that the purge gas can be automatically switched via software during the experiment. The purge gases must flow horizontally to minimize buoyancy effects. The flow rate must also be adjustable via software during an experiment and the data logged into the resulting data file.</p>
<p>6. Robotic Auto-sampler/Pan Punching: Because this instrument will be used extensively, and often on a 24 hour basis, it must come equipped with a robotic auto-sampler containing at least 20 sample positions with ability to use pans up to 250&#61549;L pan volume. The instrument must also be capable of performing a unique experiment on each sample within one loaded sample tray. The auto-sampler must also include a contamination free pan punching mechanism, by which samples can be kept sealed in a hermetic environment, and punched open just prior to loading. Ideally, this pan punching will produce a large breach in the pan, rather than a pin-hole, as our materials rely on efficient sample/gas interaction. The system must also have the capability of rejecting any pan that is not pierced. This is to prevent a sealed pan being loaded into the TGA furnace</p>
<p>7. Variable Rate Control: The TGA instrument should include some form of automatic variable rate control to improve resolution. Ideally, the heating rate will be continuously adjusted as a function of sample mass loss rate, as opposed to a "stepwise isothermal" approach.</p>
<p>8. High Resolution TGA: The instrument must be capable of automatically and continuously change heating rate as a function of sample weight change. This feature adjusts the temperature increase to lower heating rate as weight loss increases allowing for accurate identification of the exact temperature at which a peak occurs.</p>
<p>9. Temperature Modulated TGA: The instrument must be capable of performing Temperature Modulated TGA experiments over the entire temperature operating range using a regular, periodic function of known amplitude and frequency to ensure steady state control during the experiment, as well as experimental reproducibility.</p>
<p>10. Software: As this TGA will be used by numerous researchers, the analysis program should be un-keyed, and should include a site license such that it may be installed (if-needed) on an unlimited number of computers within the FDA. The data analysis program should also include a .pdf generator, for the efficient export of analyzed plots.</p>
<p>The TGA must also include operating software which allows for the instrument to be fully calibrated and verified automatically, without the need for operator presence. Calibrations must include weight and temperature (Curie point). Scheduling capabilities must be present, such that these calibrations and/or verifications can be programmed to perform during normal quiescent periods, such as overnight or on weekends.</p>
<p>In addition, the instrument software must be capable of performing a series of auto-diagnostic tests, either manually or through the scheduling component. These tests should verify the performance of various instrument components such as auto-sampler motors, electronic boards, mass flow controllers, etc. The results of these tests should be logged and the log file accessible to the operator. The instrument should allow for automatic, unattended calibration of both temperature (curie-point standards) and mass. These calibrations should be programmable and schedulable from within the operating software.</p>
<p>Contractors must satisfy the following requirements. Provide a detailed description of your company's (including its teammates, if applicable) experience and demonstrated abilities to deliver the type of kit described above.</p>
<p>A firm fixed price contract is anticipated. This is a new requirement. The NAICS Code is 334516, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.<br />Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice. However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability to provide the specific instrument(s) as required. Responses must directly demonstrate the company's ability to effectively provide the instrument(s) described above.</p>
<p><br />Responses to this notice shall be limited to 10 pages, and must include:<br />1. Company name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and FAX numbers, website address (if available), and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.<br />2. Name, title, telephone number, and e-mail addresses of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses.<br />3. Business size for NAICS 334516 (500 employees) and status, if qualified as an 8(a) firm (must be certified by SBA), Small Disadvantaged Business (must be certified by SBA), Woman-Owned Small Business, HUBZone firm (must be certified by SBA), and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (must be listed in the VetBiz Vendor Information Pages).<br />4. DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax Identification Number, and company structure (Corporation, LLC, partnership, joint venture, etc.). Companies also must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR, at www.ccr.gov) to be considered as potential sources.<br />5.

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT


STATEMENT OF WORK PART A â€“ GENERAL INFORMATION

A.1  INTRODUCTION â€“ Hyperglycemia is a common occurrence in veterans admitted to an intensive care unit at Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS). Tight control of glucose has been shown to be associated with reduced morbidity and mortality and improved outcomes for these patients. This clinical problem can occur in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients alike. 
Complications can include:
â€¢	Increased risk of nosocomial infection 
â€¢	Impaired immune system 
â€¢	Delayed wound healing  
â€¢	Volume depletion 
â€¢	Increased risk of death and impairment post-stroke in non-diabetic patients 

A.2  BACKGROUND â€“ Patients without diabetes admitted to MCCU or SICU, including but not limited to those with the diagnoses listed below, with an admitting blood glucose value or random Blood Glucose value of > 130 should be placed on the insulin protocol by physician order in CPRS, unless contraindicated.

a.	Patients without diabetes who have admission glucose <130 and one of the diagnoses listed below should have glucose monitored every shift and placed on the protocol if hyperglycemia occurs.

b.	Any patient admitted to the SICU or MCCU already on an intravenous insulin infusion should be placed on the protocol

c.	Any critically ill patient with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus should go on the insulin protocol

d.	All patients with persistent hyperglycemia or any patient with diabetes mellitus should be converted to basal/bolus subcutaneous insulin prior to transfer from the ICU. NPH insulin is the preferred formulary basal insulin and should be used unless the patient was already on glargine insulin prior to admission. 

e.	Use of short acting insulin "sliding scale" without basal insulin leads to very poor glucose control and is thus strongly discouraged in the SICU or MCCU

f.	All patients with a known diagnosis of diabetes mellitus should have a hemoglobin A1c obtained upon admission to the ICU, to facilitate transition to subcutaneous insulin and adjustment of diabetes medications after ICU discharge. Inpatient endocrine consultation should be strongly considered upon ICU discharge for any patient with an admission hemoglobin A1c â‰¥9%
 Surgical cases identified that would benefit from ICU tight blood glucose control:

â€¢	CT Surgery
â€¢	Coronary Artery Bypass
â€¢	Valvular Replacement/Repair
â€¢	Lung Resection / Thoracotomy
â€¢	Heart transplantation

o	Vascular Surgery
â€¢	Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair
â€¢	Aortobifemoral Bypass 
â€¢	Lower Extremity Arterial Bypass 

o	General Surgery 
â€¢	Liver Resection
â€¢	Pancreatic Resection
â€¢	Biliary / Intestinal Bypass
â€¢	Necrotizing Fascitis
â€¢	Major Visceral Resection to include gastric, duodenum, small intestine, colon
â€¢	Any inflammatory bowel disease patient undergoing resection

o	ENT
â€¢	Radical Neck Dissection

ï‚§	Urology
â€¢	Radical Prostatectomy
â€¢	Nephrectomy
â€¢	Cystectomy with or without Ileoconduit

o	Other
â€¢	Patients with Sepsis
â€¢	Acute Pancreatitis 
â€¢	Morbid Obesity (BMI > 40)
â€¢	Critically ill neurosurgical patients (Note: glucose targets and dextrose infusion rates may need to be modified according to clinical judgement for patients with increased intracranial pressure and/or lowered seizure threshold). 






MCCU Guideline for tight glycemic control
All patients who require critical care treatment in the MCCU will be considered candidates for the insulin protocol as ordered by the ICU physicians. Common diagnoses that will warrant such consideration in the MCCU include:

ï‚§	Severe sepsis, with or without shock
ï‚§	Respiratory failure
Pancreatitis
Stroke
Myocardial Infarction
Cardiogenic Shock
Acute myocardial infarction 
Acute coronary syndrome in a patient with known diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia on MCCU admission (BG persistently >180)

All critically ill patients will be considered regardless of a prior known diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Any serum glucose measurement of greater than 130 warrants consideration for tight glucose control with the decision to institute the intravenous insulin protocol dependant on the orders of the ICU physicians. Note- for patients with critical myocardial ischemia (i.e. unstable angina or critical left main or LAD disease) that are prone to angina at rest should be given a more conservative glucose target of 100-140 mg/dl to avoid hypoglycemia-induced angina. 



A.3  SCOPE OF WORK â€“ Registered Nurses assigned to the Special Care Units and trained on the use of Endo Tool may titrate continuous insulin infusions according to dose calculator within outlined parameters. 
 

STATEMENT OF WORK PART C â€“ SUPPORTING INFORMATION

C.1 Place of Performance â€“ EndoTool involves the Nurses, IT staff, and pharmacy. The actual performance of the software is in the specialty units.

C.2 Period of Performance â€“ All admission to the specialty units will be considered to be placed on EndoTool for tight glucose control. (please see answer under background)

C.3 Special Considerations â€“ If it is contraindicated according to the physician.
C.3.1 Contractor Furnished Materials â€“ EndoTool is a unique software system for managing glycemic control in your hospital. This FDA-cleared system will effectively control blood glucose levels, even in the most challenging patients. EndoTool is installed on your hospital's existing IT system. It is easy to use, needing only a current blood glucose level from a point-of-care device to compute the patient's correct insulin dose. EndoTool will prompt the nurse when the patient is glycemically stable, and is ready to be transferred over to subcutaneous insulin via patient-specific orders generated by EndoTool. 

C.3.2  Government Furnished Materials and Services â€“It is installed on the bedside monitors
C.3.3 Qualifications of Key Personnel â€“Registered Nurses that are assigned to the Specialty units and trained on the use of the EndoTool.

C.3.4 Security Requirements â€“ The software is obtained via computer through individual passwords by each registered nurse in the specialty unit. The physician put the orders in to place and remove from the drip.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center"><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt">Software as a Service (SaaS) Email and Collaboration</span></strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt">&nbsp;</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt">Request for Information (RFI)</span></strong></p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) announces the start of the BetterBuy pilot project to receive comments on the intent to replace the current GSA enterprise on-premise email and collaboration support to a web-based, Software as a Service (SaaS) Email and Collaboration services and support contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Purpose</strong></p>
<p>GSA seeks to gain insight into how to replace most effectively our current enterprise support for email and collaboration with a highly innovative, creative, cost-effective, and evolving environment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ideal solution would be an integrated tool set through which the government monitors performance metrics and that allows the government to manage through roles and business rules rather than physical control of assets and direct software licensing. The government believes that traditional outsourcing and system integration support is insufficiently adaptive and costly and should be replaced for commodity services with a SaaS Cloud Computing offering.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background</strong></p>
<p>GSA has historically sought new ideas in technology that would increase customer focus and service to the public. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The current possibilities and value in sorting, sharing, and networking collective information can be enhanced by commercially available services. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>GSA's current technology is aged, consumes valuable resources for in-house management, and represents a continuing burden of delayed access to upgrades with a high cost for maintenance.<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> </span><span style="COLOR: black"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>By acquiring state-of-the-art email and collaboration services in a cloud environment, GSA will equip and empower its employees and increase effective interaction with customers and business partners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The resulting capabilities should act as a catalyst to accelerate and improve the delivery of mission goals and services in the future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>Market research has indicated that the acquisition of a progressive services solution that is off-premises, integrated, and web-based can be more cost effective, as well as provide considerable additional capability (tools and opportunities) to serve our agency clients and the public more efficiently.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this effort, the definition of Cloud Computing will follow the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) definition (see Note 1)&nbsp;of "a model for enabling convenient, <span style="COLOR: black">on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released </span>with minimal management effort or service provider interaction<span style="COLOR: black">."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Likewise, we will use the NIST definition of Software as a Service (SaaS):<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>"</span>The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email). The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Functional Objectives of the Solicitation </strong></p>
<p>The objective of the solicitation is to replace existing technology with integrated SaaS service offerings for the GSA Enterprise that provide the following general functionality:</p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Email<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contact Management<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calendar<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E-Discovery and Litigation Hold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archive and Backup<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collaboration Tools and Technology<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solution Installation and Administration<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Training</p>
<p>These functions must provide sufficient security, privacy, and accessibility to meet federal guidelines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The solution should be highly integrated, robust, offer multiple aspects of collaboration, and demonstrate adaptability for future technical developments.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Objectives of the Wiki</strong></p>
<p>The principal objective of the wiki posting is to gain opinions related to the following two questions:<br /><br />1. What type of acquisition vehicle would be best suited to accomplish the Statement of Objectives? Full and Open Competition? GWAC? Others? Please provide your rationale for the method you suggest.<br /><br />2. One of the cornerstones of the GSA OCIO mission is cost effective and pioneering solutions. What type of solutions and services would you propose to meet the statement of objectives?&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="COLOR: black">Instructions for Submission of RFI Responses</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">GSA will be using a wiki as the technology for participation under the BetterBuyProject, and anyone can register with the </span>BetterBuy <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Pilot</span> Wiki<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"> in order to participate. </span>GSA is seeking comments and improvements on the draft solicitation documents located on the wiki page.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The wiki is meant to provide a forum to encourage questions and commentary prior to the release of a solicitation.</p>

<DESC>Rapid Deployment Damage Control Vertical Storage Pack (VSP)
<p>The USCG SFLC is looking for sources possessing the capabilities to provide or design/fabricate a Rapid Deployment Damage Control Vertical Storage Pack (VSP). The VSP is intended for storage and rapid deployment of pipe patching and plugging kit components onboard military maritime vessels. Minimum requirements- The pack to hang from the bulkhead and is open to display all the kit components readily and in an organized manner. Shall be capable of meeting weight carrying constraints for male and female crew and envisioned to be designed to unzip into 2 subassemblies for individual carrying. Sub assy 1 should be primary tools and sub assy 2 should be patching and plugging items. Maximum dimensions of the combined pack shall be less than 28X68 inches as they will store immediately adjacent to Navy standard watertight doors along transverse bulkheads without impeding the door from opening or being latched. Main Objectives: Enable vertical storage of plugging and patching tools and components in the allotted max dimension and weight. Ensure durability and longevity of design/material in excess of six years of routine shipboard use. Ensure identification, removal and deployment of desired components/sections of VSP within flooded compartments within 30 seconds while in a low light environment (not counting transit time to or from compartment). Enable rapid inventorying of VSP components (NTE 5 minutes). The VSP is not intended to replace the existing plugging and pipe patching kits in the shipboard repair locker inventory but to augment the inventory with the rapidly deployable components at the major watertight divisions likely deployed by an unprotected sailor taking initial actions to mitigate damage. The VSP shall be made out of durable nylon material, with the ability to separate the pack into two separate sections by appropriate sized composite zippers based on total weight of the pack. When the two subsections of the pack are fastened together it shall be capable of being hung on a bulkhead, wire cage or similar vertical surface with all components stored securely in place. The normally stored support hanging MUST be accomplished by at least two closed metal 2" stainless steel "D rings", but the VSP or components of it may incorporate additional hanging mechanisms for use during active deployment of the pack (e.g. the patching/plugging portion could have a separate hanger to be utilized when separated from the tool section). The items contained by the VSP will be stowed and fastened down using non corrosive, appropriately sized nylon straps or Velcro TM strapping for light weight items. Pockets for non tool components can be constructed of interlaced webbing instead of sheet fabric to enable inventory and save material weight if necessary. Items shall be fastened in such a way that they cannot fall out in any orientated 360 degree position and potentially cause physical harm to the users (e.g. blades of tools protected). Weight of each section shall not exceed 37 pounds, and that the fully assembled pack with equipment can withstand the overall weight distribution while being hung on a bulkhead. The overall pack shall be capable of being secured closed, and carried by TWO crewmen using a handle at each end of the pack. Each individual sub assembly shall be capable of being unzipped, folded over and carried by one person using handles or shoulder straps. No elastic materials, or non 316 stainless steel metal fasteners shall be used in the construction of the pack. Material specification sheets are required for any clear plastic material incorporated into the design as "label viewing windows". All materials shall be water resistant and non absorbent to inhibit mold growth.</p>
<p>Interested sources shall contact the Contract Specialist, demonstrating their knowledge, capabilities and abilities to provide a VSP. This request is FOR INFORMATION ONLY, no pricing information is being requested.</p>

Statement of Need
Tools for Viewing Stereo Pair Digital Imagery in the Field
USDA Forest Service
San Dimas Technology and Development Center
February, 2010
Part 1. General Information
A.	Need
Aerial photographs analyzed with stereoscopes, in the office and remote locations, have been fundamental to the business of the Forest Service for over 80 years.  Multi-scale airborne image collection has recently transitioned to direct digital or scanned digital deliverable.  These digital datasets are collected in stereo and viewed using the ERDAS Imagine or ArcGIS extension, Stereo Analyst. 
The Stereo Analyst extension enables the display of stereo pairs within the ArcGIS environment which allows the full use of the tools available in ArcGIS.  Feature layers can be viewed, edited, and analyzed while viewing the photos in digital 3D environment.  Currently this capability is limited to the office setting.  The need is to transfer this capability to the field setting, where environmental concerns such as weight, moisture, dirt, and sunlight, become hardware operating concerns.
The utilization of this technology in the field would permit the resource specialist to view the stereo pairs in conjunction with their current GPS position and ArcGIS overlays to locate, measure, and record ground features using a method other than anaglyph viewing.
B.	Scope and Intent
The purpose of this request is to solicit information from and gauge the interest of parties that might be interested in identifying technology that could perform the following tasks in a cost-effective, field-practical, and reasonably accurate manner:
1.	Identify equipment and/or software that can be used to view digital stereo photos using mobile, field ruggedized, equipment such as laptops, PDAs, or head-mounted displays. 
2.	Identify equipment and/or software that can be used to take and record measurements on digital stereo photos using mobile equipment such as laptops, PDAs, or head mounted displays.
Interested parties are requested to provide information on: 1) the feasibility of achieving the tasks identified; 2) how each of these tasks might be performed, and; 3) their interest in submitting a proposal should the USFS issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) in the future.  The interested parties’ approach to completing the identified tasks should be addressed separately in the event that the Forest Service (USFS) decides to obtain the services of the contractor to perform only one of the tasks.
The USFS recognizes that the interested parties may have creative methods and several options of completing these tasks.  The description in this section, therefore, is not intended to limit creative and innovative solutions of achieving the objective of developing digital stereo photo viewing and measuring technology that is cost-effective, reasonably accurate, and practical for field usage. 
Interested parties are also encouraged to critique this Statement of Need so that the future Request for Proposals (RFP) might have a more clearly articulated Statement of Work.
Part 2.  Work Requirements
The requirements provided here pertain to hardware and software that can be used in a field setting where moisture and temperature should not affect the functionality of the product.
Technical Requirements
1.	The hardware and software must be compatible with existing USFS equipment, if interfacing with a computer it must be compatible with Windows XP Professional.
2.	The software must be capable of utilizing the existing USFS digital photo format, which uses Leica Photogrammetry Suite (LPS) block files to organize digital stereo images.
3.	The equipment must be capable of presenting digital stereo images in 3D using a technology other than anaglyph.
4.	The software must be capable of presenting digital stereo images in conjunction with ArcGIS overlays while maintaining ArcGIS functionality.
5.	The equipment must be capable of being transported by a single person without compromising the safety and mobility of the user.
6.	Battery life of mobile system must be a minimum of 4-6 hours without requiring a recharge.
7.	Hardware must be designed to meet MIL-STD-810F specifications for ruggedized equipment.

Respondents to this RFI should describe their interest and ability to perform the requirements summarized within this notice. Responses should contain Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Phone Number, Fax Number, DUNS or CAGE Code, Size of Business pursuant to NAICS code 334119 (size standard $1,000,000,000) and GSA contract number, if any. Responses should address the company’s experience in providing similar services including commercial, military, or other federal Government agencies. When describing this past experience, a brief description of the size, scope, and complexity of the requirement and the contracting vehicle should be provided. To be of greatest value, responses should address the aforementioned questions and issues. Reponses should be e-mailed to the point of contact identified in the below section. Responses should be formatted as either MS Word (.doc) or Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf) and should be limited to a maximum of ten (10) pages. Proprietary/Competition Sensitive information (appropriately marked) will be protected from disclosure to the greatest extent practical; however, it is preferred that respondents do not provide proprietary or otherwise restricted responses.

<DESC>Q1842100108  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), the National Park Service (NPS) intends to enter into negotiations with Mark Foster on a sole source, non-competitive basis for Producing a Historic Structure Report for the Baker/Robinson Oil Works Building at New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park (NEBE) including making recommendations for the creation of exhibits and interpretive tools.  Mark Foster has extensive experience with the documentation of buildings relating to the whaling industry and how these  buildings function.  Mark Foster has done architectural drawings for the National Park Service (NPS) and is familiar with NPS historic structure reporting standards.  Mr. Foster has published an article on a Nantucket whale oil works building after documenting the use and history of the structure, and that experience in a  similar type industrial building also makes him uniquely qualified to document the Baker/Robinson Oil Works Building.  He also has experience as an exhibit designer, which makes him uniquely qualified to make recommendations for the creation of exhibits and interpretive tools focused on the history of the Baker/Robinson Oil Works Building and it's connection to the whaling industry.  It would be in the best interest of the government to use the services of Mark Foster to research, document, and prepare a Historic Structure Report and make exhibit recommendations for the Baker/Robinson Oil Works Building.  Utilizing Mr. Foster's expertise would be cost effective due to his familiarity with this type of work and NPS standards.  Therefore, in accordance with the above cited authority, the government intends to enter into negotiations with Mark Foster within 15 days after publication of this notice. The anticipated term of this contract is from June 1, 2010 through February 25, 2011.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

The above acquisition is for the replacement of multiple existing deteriorated septic systems which service 11 NPS buildings in and around the Boston Mills Historic District with a centralized collection and treatment system. The project is located in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park and will be funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The government estimate for the project is approximately $1.1 million. The project is planned as a set-aside for a sole source 8(a) award in accordance with FAR 19.805 that requires all contract actions below the threshold of $3.5M be solicited as a sole source contract with a qualified 8(a), if one exists.  The intended contractor, SAF INC., is an eligible 8(a) contractor and has been approved by the SBA for this project.
As required by ARRA regulations, this documentation provides the rationale for a noncompetitive award using ARRA funds.    
SAF has prior construction project experience with the National Park Service in the Midwest Region and at the Cuyahoga Valley National Park specifically.  All past performance information received has been excellent and the park recommended this contractor.  In preliminary discussions with SAF, the contractor has indicated that they are capable of providing all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, professional and technical expertise to accomplish the services for this project.  Timely award of the project at a fair and reasonable price is anticipated.
This project is a bureau approved Recovery Act project. Working directly with an 8(a) firm will allow the Government to award this contract quickly, thereby ensuring that the intent of the bill - saving jobs and creating jobs - is accomplished as expeditiously as possible. Based on current baseline acquisition times, a sole source 8(a) will reduce the time needed to award and obligate the ARRA funds.  
Based on the above, a sole source 8(a) award to SAF is considered to be in the best interest of the government for successful project completion and compliance with ARRA award timelines.  In the spirit of ARRA funding, other projects in the park and region are planned for competition through Hubzone and Full & Open competitions.

This is not a request for proposal or a request for quote.  
There is no solicitation document available.  
This is a notice of intent of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) at Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) to negotiate a sole source contract with Northrop Grumman Information Technology (NGIT), for the purchase of BMC and Veritas software and Veritas software maintenance.  Software maintenance includes reasonable technical support and periodic updates/releases to the software.  BMC and Veritas are both available on SEWP; however, it will be acquired from Northrop Grumman I.T., Inc. via the AACES Prime Vendor Contract V200P-909.  
AITC has an existing BMC and Veritas licensing agreement through NGIT for all BMC and Veritas products with terms and conditions the AITC needs for its disaster recovery/continuity of business program operations.  It is in the best interest of the Government to acquire the products through this vehicle to ensure consistent terms and conditions in licensing and maintenance, and to take advantage of administrative cost savings obtained from having all products licensed and maintained through a single vendor.  The strategies are in the best interest of the Federal government and the price is fair and reasonable.  
The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).  
This procurement is being conducted using FAR Part 12 procedures.  
If you have any questions, please reply no later than May 14, 2010 to Sylvia Thomas at Sylvia.Thomas2@va.gov.

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008)</p>
<p>(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>
<p>(1) The solicitation number;</p>
<p>(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;</p>
<p>(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;</p>
<p>(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;</p>
<p>(5) Terms of any express warranty;</p>
<p>(6) Price and any discount terms;</p>
<p>(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;</p>
<p>(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);</p>
<p>(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;</p>
<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>
<p>(i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation.

<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<DESC><p align="left">REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p align="left">The United States Government (Government) currently occupies office and related space in a building under a lease in Washington, DC that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 22,552 rentable square feet (RSF) of office and related space. The space must yield&nbsp;approximately 21,315 ANSI/BOMA Office Area Square Feet (BOASF) of contiguous office space in Washington, DC.</p>
<p align="left">The Government's existing lease is expiring and the Government is considering whether or not it would be economically advantageous to relocate. In addition to the rental costs, the Government will also factor in costs of moving to a new location including, but not limited to, physical move, tenant improvements, abovestandard/specialized alterations/equipment, furniture relocation, telecommunications, and other related costs. Note that these same costs may not be factored in when evaluating whether it is most advantageous to the Government to remain in the current location.</p>
<p align="left">The building must be located in a professional surrounding and/or tasteful rehabilitation in current use. Streets and public sidewalks must be well maintained. Space must be located within a one-half mile radius from the Francis Perkins Building (Dept. of Labor Headquarters, located at 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20210).</p>
<p align="left">The anticipated term is for 10 years firm and the lease should be fully serviced (warm-lit shell). The estimated occupancy date is April 2011.</p>
<p align="left">Buildings offered for consideration must be of sound and substantial construction of the type generally recognized as contemporary with the ability to meet all current Federal, State, and local codes requirements including but not limited to fire and life safety, accessibility, OSHA, and seismic protection.</p>
<p align="left">The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing lease space or relocate to alternative space. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, etc.</p>

The Center provides research, analysis and systems capability to DOT and other agencies requiring expertise in national transportation and logistics programs.

The Center's professional staff represent a variety of fields including engineering, the computer, physical and social sciences, mathematics and operations research as well as administrative and management arenas.

The Contractor shall meet the performance requirements and standards as set forth in Attachment A. A session may be cancelled if there are an insufficient number of attendees (fewer than 20) to make the event cost effective. The cancellation notice will be given to the Contractor at least 14 calendar days in advance of the scheduled class. If the session is cancelled, the Government will reimburse the Contractor for the costs associated with creating the curriculum.</p>
<p>TASK 2. The Contractor shall provide a qualified instructor, who is well versed in all subject matter to be covered, can answer in depth questions on each topic, provide the required training in a classroom setting, using sound principles of adult learning to achieve the identified learning goals detailed below.</p>
<p>TASK 3. The Contractor shall be responsible for developing a course curriculum and delivering training that includes principles, skills and strategies of leadership and employee engagement that prepares each attendee to effectively accomplish the following learning goals:<br />1. Define the concepts of engagement and empowerment<br />2. Identify behaviors that evidence and encourage engagement and empowerment<br />3. Identify the specific impact of the organization's culture on engagement and empowerment<br />4. Invest in staff in ways that enhance their sense of personal empowerment<br />5.

Apply the action ideas presented in the program.<br />8. Reinforce learning at 1, 3 and 6 month intervals after training completion.</p>
<p>TASK 4. The Contractor must be aware that the audience is comprised of some very seasoned managers as well as less seasoned managers, and aspiring leaders.

<p>IV. DELIVERABLES: SEE ATTACHMENT B</p>
<p><br />V. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT: The Government shall provide the following material and equipment to the Contractor for the training session:</p>
<p>1. The classroom facility at the Volpe Center, 55 Broadway, Cambridge, MA in which to present the course that will accommodate an audience of up to 35 participants.<br />2.

<p>VII. SCHEDULE: One 1 1/2 day training event will be presented before September 30, 2010 for up to 35 executives and managers. Four optional training sessions, two each in fiscal years 2011 and 2012. Dates to be coordinated upon award. PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (END)</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CRITERIA: 1. TRAINING METHODOLOGY: The Offeror shall describe, in sufficient detail, the approach to be used in performing the tasks identified in the performance work statement (PWS) (no more than 5 pages). 2. STAFFING REQUIREMENTS: The Offeror's representative(s) will possess skills appropriate to conduct training for executives and managers on leadership skills related to employee engagement and empowerment, and must possess the following minimum education and experience: (resume of proposed trainer shall be no more than 3 pages): A Master's degree from an accredited college or university in organizational behavior, psychology, or similar field that has prepared the Contractor to apply and teach the leadership principles relevant to this course. A Doctorate degree is preferred. This level of educational achievement is equal to that of many of the attendees and will facilitate acceptance as an expert in the field. The instructor should possess a thorough theoretical knowledge of the topic through publications and/or experience. As a minimum, the instructor should possess 10 years of experience training executives and managers. 3. PAST PERFORMANCE: If the instructor has had verifiable experience presenting leadership training satisfactorily to Federal executives and/or managers, that experience may be used to determine best value to the Federal government. If the offeror has performed work in the past two years for the Volpe Center, that performance may be considered when determining the capability to perform the work. BASIS OF AWARD: <br />Award will be made to the Offeror who offers the best value to the Government in terms of technical criteria (proposed training methodology, staffing and past performance) and price. ORDER OF IMPORTANCE: The technical evaluation factors in the Technical Proposal are of equal importance (training methodology, staffing requirements and past performance), and when combined, are significantly more important than cost in the selection of a contractor for award. Notwithstanding this fact, Offerors are cautioned not to minimize the importance of the Price Proposal. As the difference in technical ratings of submitted Technical Proposals decreases, the importance of price will increase. When the Technical Proposals are evaluated as essentially equal, price may become the determining factor in making an award. PLEASE NOTE: Reiteration of the Statement of Work requirements does not constitute an acceptable response and will be considered non-responsive.</p>
<p>Price proposal for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) is in accordance with the Performance Work Statement and shall include all labor, materials and travel-related expenses including lodging necessary to conduct the class(es).

<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

We reserve the right to make award without discussion.  Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. This is a best value procurement.  The following factors will be used to evaluate the offers:  
(1) Technical Evaluation - Each offeror is responsible for submitting a detailed description of how the requirement will be accomplished in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SOW.  This is to be submitted as a separate document from the price quote.  The Government shall be evaluating offerors on the basis of the material presented in the written quote.  The offeror's quote shall contain: (A) responses tailored specifically to the evaluation factors listed in the solicitation; (B) written in plain language (VA prohibits the use of elaborate technical proposals); (C) limited to a total of 15 pages in 12-point font.  All written deliverables shall be phrased in layperson language.  Statistical and other technical terminology shall not be used without providing a glossary of terms.  
(2) Past Performance - Demonstrating the same or similar service as service required in this solicitation. The past performance evaluation will consider reliability of past performance information, source of information, and the relevance of information.  Offerors shall include sources for previous contract work for the same or similar services as specified in the statement of work.  Offerors without relevant past performance or for whom past performance information is not available, will receive a neutral rating.  Relevant past performance information shall include key personnel who have relevant experience, predecessor companies, and subcontractors who will perform major or critical elements of this solicitation. Describe your overall reputation for satisfying customers and your commitment to customer satisfaction. Describe problems encountered in past performance and corrective action taken to overcome such problems on contracts comparatively similar to the requirements of this solicitation. Identify at least three references, preferably federal agency contracts, including contract number, dates of performance, points of contact, and telephone numbers, whereby you have provided the same or similar services, of the magnitude described in this solicitation.  References will be considered in the evaluation process.  Government evaluators reserve the right to contact any of the provided references to solicit additional information or clarification regarding the Offeror's past performance.  The Contracting Officer and/or technical evaluators may also research Offeror performance on any federal, state, local or commercial contract performance of the Offeror that is known to the Contracting Officer and/or technical evaluators, but not included as a reference on a submitted proposal.   Note that Government evaluators may also utilize various federal, state, and local past performance databases including, but not limited to, Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), and DLA's Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS) system.  Where no Past Performance Questionnaire form is received the rating for that Questionnaire will be neutral.  In the event that no Past Performance questionnaires are received for an Offeror, the Government will give the Offeror a neutral rating.
3.  Socioeconomic Status - To the maximum extent feasible, the Contractor and any sub-Contractors will comply with VA's Service Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and, Veteran-owned Small Business (VOSB) socio-economic and other small business goals, including, but not limited to 38U.S.C. 8127 and 8128 of Public Law (PL) 109-461.
In an effort to achieve socioeconomic small business goals, VA will evaluate Offerors based on their SDVOSB or VOSB  status, and their proposed use of eligible SDVOSB or VOSB as subcontractors.  Eligible SDVOSB Offerors will receive full credit, and Offerors qualifying as VOSB businesses will receive partial credit for the SDVOSB or VOSB status evaluation factor, if included in the proposal.  In order to receive credit an Offeror must be registered in VetBiz.gov Vendor Information Pages (https://www.VetBiz.gov).  
The VA shall accord extra evaluation credit or value to Offerors which are SDVOSB or VOSB.  To receive credit an Offeror (if a prime) or a veteran firm used as a subcontractor must be registered and verified in VetBiz.gov Vendor Information pages.

(3) Price - Price will be evaluated to determine its fairness, completeness and reasonableness as it relates to the services offered.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to fund and employ a Sr. Program Manager to support USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives' (OTI) regional activities within the Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) Bureau. The Sr. Program Manager will assist one of OTI's regional teams in the management of existing country programs and participate in new country program assessments as the need arises. OTI currently has three regional teams: Asia and Middle East (AME), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC).</p>
<p>DCHA/OTI's strategic objectives are based on the premise that fast, direct, and overt political development assistance is needed as a catalyst to move countries beyond crisis to stability. When a crisis occurs in a priority country, DCHA/OTI has the ability to engage in that country and initiate a country program. A country program is designed to address the fundamental constraints prohibiting the country from emerging from crisis.</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. The typical OTI country strategy involves: reshaping hard-line attitudes and perceptions; promoting democracy, human rights, and basic freedoms; disseminating objective information; and effecting positive political change - wherever and whenever possible.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to hire qualified personnel needed to assist and support OTI's regional teams with program implementation-related activities.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Sr. Program Manager will be based in Washington, D.C. and will be a member of one of DCHA/OTI's regional teams responsible for all program-related activity in the specific region. The incumbent will report to and be supervised by one of the Regional Team Leaders. The specific duties and responsibilities include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Support of implementation and management of assigned country program(s), including contractors and grantees working under country programs and provide support, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field, being prepared to travel to difficult posts overseas for up to 3 months if required.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with NGOs, international donors, Department of State and other U.S. Government (USG) agencies and others interested in particular OTI country programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements.</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure completion of OTI project budgeting and contracting action needs.</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in country analysis and program design to develop existing and future programs and strategies.</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in design and implementation of new country program operations to include management, logistical, budget, administrative and contractual issues.</p>
<p>&bull; Manage and/or participate in the selection of program implementers, such as grantees, contractors, and personal services contractors.</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of country programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinate with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions, the Department of State, the National Security Council and other USG agencies and departments.</p>
<p>&bull; Implement and manage assigned country programs, including contractor and grantees working under country programs and provide support, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field.</p>
<p>&bull; Initiate and manage the preparation of documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements.</p>
<p>&bull; Perform complex country analysis and program design to develop existing and future programs and strategies in high priority countries.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop, monitor, evaluate and recommend performance measures for country programs and individual projects, including contractors and grantees.</p>
<p>&bull; Within guidelines provided by the Team Leader, negotiate program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts.</p>
<p>&bull; In coordination with the Program Development Team, conceptualize new OTI-wide program options including analytic frameworks and strategic objectives.</p>
<p>&bull; Although not a policy maker, the individual influences program policy by reason of recognized expertise in the particular field of development assistance.</p>
<p>&bull; The individual will be representing OTI in high-level conferences and meetings, explaining and interpreting policies and requirements to others, and negotiating important issues with other groups, the USAID Mission (if present), the Department of State, the National Security Council and other USG agencies and departments.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Program Manager will take direction from and will report to a Regional Team Leader or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Assessment teams or during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Assessments or during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>
<p>12. START DATE: Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.</p>

<p>The Sr. Program Manager must be an individual with sound judgment, excellent writing and communication skills and a well-developed understanding of U.S. foreign policy interests and the role transition programming can play in the mitigation of conflict and the development of democracy. Ideally, the Sr. Program Manager will have experience working on transition, fragile states, or post-conflict programs that are similar to those that OTI implements. The Sr. Program Manager will also have experience in assessment, design, monitoring and evaluation of activities and programs implemented in the transitional environments in which OTI works.</p>
<p>The successful candidate must be able to accomplish a wide range of assignments on short notice. Since work often involves evolving program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual must be someone who is highly flexible and able to work on multiple tasks simultaneously. S/he must be able to work effectively and productively as a member of a team.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<SUBJECT>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) FY 2010 Emergent Research and Development Requirements
<SOLNBR>BAA0003-10
<RESPDATE>041211
<CONTACT>John Dormer, Contracting Officer, Phone 215-737-2284, Email john.dormer@dla.mil - Angela E. Mattox, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-767-6676, Email angela.mattox@dla.mil
<DESC>This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/ Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the acquisition of research and development in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 35.016 Broad agency announcement, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.    No formal solicitation will be issued.  Only the information provided in this notice is available.  Requests for same shall be disregarded.  It is intended that this BAA be open for a period of one year from the date of publication.

1.  BACKGROUND

The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Logistics Research & Development (R&D) Branch is charged with conducting research and development in all areas relevant to the DLA mission and across all DLA supply chains.  DLA defines its current R&D requirements each year and seeks funding for them through the Department of Defense’s Program Planning, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process.  These planned-for requirements produce a robust logistics R&D program addressing areas such as energy readiness, combat rations, uniform manufacturing, shelters, casting and forging, weapon system sustainment, medical logistics and electronics availability.  Despite these ongoing efforts, other R&D requirements arise each year that could not have been anticipated and were not budgeted. 

DLA’s need for this “Emergent (R&D) Requirements BAA” stems from the appearance of these unplanned-for R&D requirements that are not addressed by the PPBE process.  Most of these requirements are in the form of additional research areas (beyond those funded by DLA’s President’s Budget request) added by Congress to the DLA R&D appropriation each year.  Other emergent requirements come from DLA in the course of the year.  These requirements can address virtually any logistics-related R&D topic and each year generally presents a mixture of new projects and new funding on prior years’ congressionally directed efforts.

2.  AREAS OF INTEREST

The particular emergent requirements that are the subject of this BAA are:  

(1)  Energy 

(a)  Exploring the use of various biofuels feedstocks in jet and other mobility fuels and examining the impact of introducing biofuels into the current jet fuel delivery stream.

(b) Development of modular and transportable advanced hydrogen-based energy storage systems that can be adapted to forward operating bases.  Particular interest exists in reconfigurable fuel cell and storage systems that are integrated with photovoltaic hydrogen generation capability.

(c) Evaluating new technology that converts waste to fuel and is scalable to a mobile unit prototype with the result of using waste feedstock to generate fuel for forward operating bases that is compliant with the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.

(d) Advancing existing research technologies in carbon capture and sequestration for the future production of coal-based jet fuels for the Department of Defense (DoD).  Efforts in this area of interest should be directed to determining the feasibility of DoD applying these technologies through study and expert examination with respect to DoD requirements and include a plan for the coordination and execution of projects to demonstrate promising technologies.   

(2) Sustainment and Related Manufacturing 

(a)  Developing, testing, and applying new techniques to accelerate their adoption by small and medium sized firms of sustainable manufacturing techniques and their ability to manufacture “green products.”  

(b) Providing services including training and one-on-one assistance to small manufacturing firms either (i) that are located in the state or region in which the proposer is located or (ii) that are characterized by the Small Business Administration (SBA) as Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) to upgrade capabilities to supply parts to DoD.   Services may include enhancing their reverse engineering capabilities, including developing acceptable technical data packages.  Training or assistance that is duplicative of services available from the DoD Procurement Technical Assistance Cooperative Agreement (PTAC) Program as described at http://www.dla.mil/db/ptap.asp and http://www.aptac-us.org/new/ are discouraged.

(c) Applications of existing logistics, engineering, and manufacturing decision support tools, expertise, and technologies to identify and resolve weapon systems support challenges at low cost.									
(d) Developing and demonstrating automated parts ordering tools based on Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs) that allow a technician to requisition parts interactively from the IETM by capturing application data from the IETM and supplying that data to ordering systems and other authoritative sources.

(3)Distribution and Reutilization Operations

(a)  Technologies to improve the velocity, visibility, and value of distribution services provided by the agency, through its Defense Distribution Center (DDC) field activity, to the military services. 

(b) Technologies to improve the effectiveness and return on investment for the reutilization services provided by the agency, through its Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) field activity, to the military services in the 2050 timeframe.

(c) University-led efforts to study and develop Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies for use in defense logistics applications.

3.  GENERAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION

DLA requests interested parties to submit an initial synopsis, commonly referred to as "white paper."   White papers may be based on fundamental R&D; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements and processes; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; development of associated industrial capabilities support techniques and processes; development of associated manufacturing techniques and processes; modeling and simulation; simulation-based acquisition; integrated data environments and product data managers; and development of operational systems. 

Any responsible source capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a white paper which shall be considered by DLA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit white papers and join others in submitting white papers; however, no portion of this BAA shall be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in this technology.

<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />900 Half St. SW, JR11-0203, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3692 Fax: (202) 475-3904</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">This RFP seeks Offerors who can provide core services, such as biorepository operations, sample processing, and molecular processing and analysis. The caHUB is seeking to establish a centralized biospecimen collection and processing model (caHUB core operations) to ensure that process variables are minimized until their effects on the results of molecular analyses become well understood. This centralization specifically means that operations to process the biospecimens procured by the caHUB will occur at specialized core facilities with the majority of the processing and management channeled to the CBR. As much as possible, standardized protocols approved by the caHUB PMT will be utilized throughout the process to control variability and enhance comparability of samples across time and site of collection. This control and minimization of variability will target the processes of biospecimen collection; receipt; logistical and physical management; processing into analytes (the molecular extracts from tissue such as DNA and RNA); the subdivision of tissue; blood fractionation; molecular, clinical, and histological characterization and annotation of the specimens; and distribution of tissue or analytes to caHUB customers with rigorous QC of all intermediate and final processes and products along the workflow. <br /><br />To meet the caHUB's goals, SAIC-F will award one or more&nbsp;Basic Ordering Agreements&nbsp;to organizations capable of performing functions required for the CBR. Tissues and data procured for caHUB under a separate subcontract will be delivered to the CBR for centralized processing, quality control, diagnostic verification, processing into molecular analytes, storage, other relevant processes, and distribution for qualified research and development. The specifications and guidelines for this body of work will be finalized in negotiations with the successful Offeror.<br /><br />ALL OFFERS MUST BE RECEIVED BY 2 P.M. (EDT) ON JUNE 17, 2010. Proposals shall be submitted to Jennifer Thomas, SAIC-Frederick, Inc., 92 Thomas Johnson Drive, Suite 250, Frederick, MD 21702.<br /><br />ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE&nbsp;RECEIVED BEFORE 2 P.M. (EDT) ON MAY 14, 2010.&nbsp; All questions shall&nbsp; be e-mailed to&nbsp; Jennifer Thomas at <a href="mailto:thomasjennifer@mail.nih.gov">thomasjennifer@mail.nih.gov</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br />caHUB is a new initiative being developed by the NCI Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research. Through an advanced network of tissue acquisition, biorepository operations, pathology review, and bioinformatics capabilities, caHUB will develop the high quality, clinically annotated biospecimens that are essential resources to accelerate the development of molecular-based diagnostics and therapeutics for personalized medicine.

<DESC>This Sources Sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Institutes of Health, NIH.  The purpose of the Sources Sought is to seek the availability and capability of small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman-owed Small Business (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) and Service-Disabled  Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB] that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein: 

NIH is a very dynamic organization which responds to the initiatives of not only the individual researcher, but to Institute Directors, and US Congressional mandates.  Research has an inherent inefficiency and many initiatives are readily abandoned and replaced by other initiatives in a slightly different direction.  These program changes are reflected in increases and/or decreases in the demand for the Medical-Surgical products that the NIH requires.

The National Institutes of Health NIH Supply Center (NIHSC), located in Gaithersburg, MD anticipates a requirement for all medical-surgical instruments and consumable products that are currently utilized in surgical procedures and experimentation.  The NIHSC anticipates that this requirement may include both its current medical-surgical offerings, and those contained in the catalog(s) of potential successful vendors.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 423450.  The related small business size standard is 500 employees.

If an associated solicitation is released, the following are special provisions applicable to all orders for delivery to the NIH Supply Center.

They are as follows:

Justification Review Document

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.  Contracting Organization:  VA Black Hills, Fort Meade, SD


2.  Description of Action:  A Firm Fixed-Price contract is contemplated for acquisition of construction services for Project 568-10-102, Replace Nursing Home Water Heaters.  This work consists of replacement of the existing water heater system serving the community living center CLC) areas in Bldg. 148 E, F and G.  The existing system is approximately 20 years old, and is in failing condition.  The existing system consists of 2 semi-instantaneous heaters.  One has completely failed, and is not considered repairable.  The second unit is also in failing condition, and the internal steam coil appears to be leaking, causing water hammer on each heating cycle.  If the second unit becomes inoperable, approximately 100 nursing home/CLC patients will be without hot water, which is unacceptable in a patient care area.  Due to the emergent nature of the situation, it is proposed to negotiate directly with a qualified, local, veteran owned plumbing contractor, Plumbing Design and Installation, Inc. (PDI).  PDI is currently working as a plumbing subcontractor on several other projects at Fort Meade, and has recently completed work at the Hot Springs campus.  They are capable of performing this work, and have indicated they would be available to begin immediately.


3.  Description of Commodities:  Work consists of furnishing and installing a new water heater system, new circulating system, associated, steam, cold water, hot water and re-circulating water piping, insulation, controls and removal of the old system equipment.  An engineering analysis and recommendations for replacement equipment has already been completed by a local A/E firm.  The A/E estimated construction costs to complete the replacement work is approximately $75,000.

4.  Statutory Authority:  41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)


5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  Use of a single source, negotiated contract with local vendor is recommended for 2 reasons.  First, time is of the essence due to the emergent nature of the work.  A single source, negotiated contract can likely be awarded much quicker.  Second, while we believe the recommendations from the engineering analysis provide adequate information as the basis for a single source proposal, it is of insufficient detail to use for full and open competitive bidding.  The additional engineering required to complete detailed plans and specifications for competitive bidding would be needlessly expensive and time consuming.  Therefore, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Statutory Authority 41 U. S. C. 253 (c)(1) is being cited.


6. Sources Solicited:  We are proposing to solicit PDI for the reasons stated in item #2.  We believe they are qualified based on other past and present projects.  They are local (within the Rapid City/Black Hills area), and they have indicated interest and availability.  They are also a veteran owned small business.  No local SDVO firms have been identified that have in-house qualifications to perform this work.  PDI was the only veteran owned firm identified of the local plumbing firms considered to be qualified.


7.  Market Survey (FAR 7.102):  In accordance with FAR Part 7, and buyersâ€™ knowledge, a minimal Market Survey was accomplished.  There are 4 local firms which would be considered qualified to perform the work required under this project.  Of the 4, only PDI was identified as being veteran owned, so they were chosen for this reason


8. Market Research Conducted: See item #7 above.  Market research consisted of review of the CCR registry to determine which qualified local firms were veteran owned or SDVO.  


9. Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:  Most recent procurement actions at this facility have utilized competitive bidding, with set aside for SDVO firms.  Nearly all recent awards under these provisions have resulted in protest, significantly delaying the start of work.  Due to the emergent nature of this work, we cannot afford any additional delay.

 
10.  Actions to remove Barriers to Competition:  This facility has an identified back log of maintenance deficiencies of over $20 million, and this amount only grows larger every year.  Full funding of needed maintenance on an annual basis would help reduce or eliminate emergency situations such as this.


11.  Contracting Officer's Certification:  Based upon the justification provided herein, recommend acquisition of this membership using other than full and open competition under authority of FAR 6.302-1.


12.  Fair and Reasonable Price:  The Contracting Officer's determination that $xxxxxx is a fair and reasonable price and is based on published price lists and pricing for the same service to the private sector.
