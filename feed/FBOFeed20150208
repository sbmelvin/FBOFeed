SOLICITATION NUMBER: M67004-15-Q-1018

Notice of Intent to Utilize Limited Sources
The Government intends to utilize the justifications  for limited sources as set forth in FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B)  and  (C) to obtain the contract services of CDO Technologies, a small business, for the Enhanced Yard Management (EYM) Sustainment Maintenance services at Albany , Georgia under a task order of Blanket Purchase Agreement M67004-11-A-0004.   CDO Technologies is the original source of the developer and implementer of EYM at Albany, GA  since 2012 and the sustainment requirement is a logical follow-on contract.   The Governments justification for utilizing the original source for logical follow on work is due to both economy and efficiency as there would be a substantial duplication of costs as well as time delays that would be both unacceptable and to the detriment of the EYM Program.
   

This is not a request for quotes or proposals.

Capable firms interested in this work shall  provide documented evidence of the depth of their experiential knowledge of Enhanced Yard Management and knowledge of its interfaces to other systems such as DPAS and ICODES to meet the Governments critical and instant requirement for initial operational capability on 23 March 2015.   Interested firms shall describe their detailed knowledge of all aspects of EYM to quickly identify, diagnose and resolve any issues discovered during go live.  The tasks in this support effort include installation and configuration of two servers at Albany GA, establishing and testing system interfaces to DPAS and to ICODES, installation and configuration of mobile handheld terminals, installation and configuration of GEM cart and fork truck applications, consulting on infrastructure changes needed to establish communication between Barstow, CA and Albany, GA, training of users, troubleshooting and helpdesk.
  All of these tasks require in-depth knowledge of EYM, Marine Corps processes, DPAS interface, ICODES interface, as well as Marine Corps infrastructure configuration and requirements.   Lastly, capable firms shall show unequivocally how they would not incur a substantial duplication of costs or cause unacceptable delays in work performance.  Only those capable firms providing all of the requested information stated herein shall be considered. 

Questions or comments to this Notice of Intent should be directed to JoAnna Lovett-Black, Contracting Officer, Blount Island Command, 5880 Channel View Blvd., Jacksonville, FL, 32226-3404, via email at  joanna.lovett-black@bic.usmc.mil.
