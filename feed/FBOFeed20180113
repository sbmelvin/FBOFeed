<DESC>Yellowstone National Park, Lake Trout Gillnetting on Yellowstone Lake

This Sources Sought notice is a request for information to be used for preliminary market research and planning purposes only. The Government is seeking responses from contractors interested in and capable of providing the required services. No proposals are being requested or accepted at this time. 

This is NOT a solicitation and no contract will be awarded from this notice. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice. The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities, and qualifications of interested parties including Small Business (SB); 8A; Historically Underutilized Business (HUBZone); Service-Disable Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOB); and Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB). 

The U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service (NPS), Yellowstone National Park expects to solicit for 'Lake Trout Gillnetting on Yellowstone Lake' (Base & Four Option Years), located inside Yellowstone National Park, Lake District, in Park & Teton Counties, WY (accessible by two-lane highway May-October):

• 54 miles south of Gardiner, MT via Grand Loop Road, Norris Canyon Road
• 55 miles east of West Yellowstone, MT via West Entrance Road, Grand Loop Road
• 99 miles north of Jackson, WY via US-89, John D Rockefeller Jr. Parkway
• 77 miles west of Cody, WY via US-16, East Entrance Road
• 66 miles southwest of Cooke City, MT via Northeast Entrance Road, Grand Loop Road

Yellowstone Lake has a surface area of 136 square miles, a shoreline length of 148 miles, and an average depth of 140 feet.  At an elevation of 7,800 feet, Yellowstone Lake is the largest high-elevation lake in North America. Unique and sensitive geothermal features are found on the bottom of the lake. Damage to these resources by gillnetting, trapnetting, or other netting strategy operations must be avoided.

The National Park Service (NPS), Yellowstone National Park contemplates awarding a Firm-fixed price type contract. The period of performance is anticipated to be for approximately five years, including a Base Year and Four Option Years.

Lake Trout Gillnetting on Yellowstone Lake: Work encompasses mobilization and on-going assistance from a professional gill net fishing operation, including all necessary personnel and gear such as boats, lines, weights, and buoys, to significantly reduce the non-native lake trout population and restore native cutthroat trout during the fishing season (ice-free) in Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park, WY.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

The suffix is assigned at the discretion of the commercial, nonprofit, or Government entity to establish additional System for Award Management (SAM) records for identifying alternative EFT accounts (see subpart 32.11) for the same entity. <br />"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-<br />(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the unique entity identifier and the EFT indicator (if applicable), the Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database; <br />(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;<br />(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and<br />(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".<br />"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes.

See www.sam.gov for the designated entity for establishing unique entity identifiers. <br />(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(c) (1) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to- <br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and <br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the unique entity identifier is maintained with the entity designated at www.sam.gov. for establishment of the unique entity identifier throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the unique entity identifier to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the unique entity identifier does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. <br />(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>

The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.
