The Panasonic Toughbook had a direct impact on the working ability of the Radio Techs at IRM/ITI/OPS/LWS/RPB because of it’s ability to withstand rugged abuse from varying climates and environments that Radio Techs work in.  The hard case allows it to be transported through airports around the world without damage where as normal laptops are damaged and crushed.  The numerous features of the Toughbook include a GPS for site surveys of installed radio systems, wireless internet access for updating radio equipment and software.  The Toughbook has a special screen that is designed for outdoor use which is extremely beneficial with programming radios in vehicles.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) is a set of laws enacted by the US Congress, designed to detect and deter money laundering.  (The BSA can be found in Title 31, US Code, Sections 5311 and following.)  Money laundering is defined as concealing or disguising the source of illicit proceeds, such as funds originating from the sale of illegal drugs and other illegal activities.  BSA mandates that all businesses that sell monetary/financial instruments, such as money orders, wire transfers, or stored value cards, must comply with all reporting requirements (compliance monitoring) and have an effective anti-money laundering program (suspicious detection and reporting) in place. 

As the United States Postal Service (USPS) sells money orders, USPS is required to, and is, complying with the BSA.

The law mandates that entities regulated by the Bank Secrecy Act must implement internal controls to ensure that all reporting requirements of the law are complied with.  The internal controls must provide the regulated entity a means to ensure that all reporting requirements are met in a timely manner.
USPS has implemented a system of automated controls which are collectively called the BSA Application.   

USPS has the need for IT professionals with WebFOCUS experience to maintain, enhance and implement new development to the BSA application.  Two (2) Developer/Programmers and one (1) Senior Developer are needed to work in our St. Louis, MO. development center.

The term of the contract will be one year, with a possible 4 one-year option periods.

<DESC>17.	The U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors, International Broadcasting Bureau,  (BBG/IBB) has a requirement for experienced contractors to provide support services for its Office of Security in the areas of radio communications and installation of security systems.  This is a full and open competitive procurement to establish multiple Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) task order type contracts. Due to the nature of this procurement the BBG recognizes that it may be difficult to locate any one firm that may have the required expertise in both technical areas therefore the likelihood of a awarding multiple contracts is possible for the worldwide support of programs assigned to the BBG?s Office of Security.  The BBG/IBB intends to award multiple IDIQ to multiple contractors to secure highly skilled and highly experienced contractors to meet this need. It is anticipated that multiple task orders for these supports services will be awarded on an as required basis during the Base-Year and each of the four (4) Option Years if exercised at the discretion of the BBG subject to the availability of funds. The awarded contracts will include a general scope of work of the BBG radio communications and security systems requirement.  However, each individual Task Order that is awarded will include a more detailed scope of work specific to the identified location where the requirement exist and will be competed among the contractors that are selected for a contract award as a result of this solicitation. The actual work to be performed, the time of such performance and the location of the work shall be determined by the Contracting Officer, who will issue formally executed Task Orders to the Contractor or Contractors that have received a contract award under this solicitation. The only work authorized under the resultant contract(s) is that which is performed after receipt of such Task Orders.  The issuance of individual Task Orders under the resultant contract(s) will be accomplished in the following manner:  (1) BBG will request each Contractor that has received an award to provide both a cost and a technical proposal for the work described in a request for proposal for the individual Task Order within one (1) to three (3) days after receipt of the request.  The request will include the basic site-specific requirements, and a request to provide a firm-fixed price and technical proposal.  (2) The contractor shall submit it?s firm-fixed-price proposal and technical proposal for the individual task order, to the BBG Office of Contracts; (3) The BBG will separately but concurrently evaluate the proposals, and (4) The BBG Office of Contracts will issue a finalized Task Order to the Contractor that has been determined to offer the Best Value to the Government based on the technical merit, price and other factors stated in the contract and any additional factors included in the request for proposal for the specified task order; (5) After receipt of the finalized Task Order the selected Contractor will proceed with the work specified in the Task Order.  Contractors NOT receiving an award under this Task Order remain eligible to compete for any subsequent BBG security installation requirement during the life of the contract.  It is anticipated that the Request For Proposals (RFP) will be available on or about January 31, 2007.  Firms interested in receiving a copy of the above numbered RFP must respond in writing to the Contracting Officer at the above address or via email to kharper@ibb.gov or facsimile at 202-260-0855.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is issuing an intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with The University of Maine, Marine Sea Grant College Program, to investigate the nearshore migration of Atlantic salmon in the Gulf of Maine Region.  The requirement will provide for study of the Atlantic salmon?s anadromous life cycle which involves major migration between natal rivers and oceanic feeding grounds, for the National Marine Fisheries Services, Gloucester, Massachusetts.   Monitoring of rivers around the North Atlantic over the past thirty years has confirmed that there has been a significant decline in overall marine survival, particularly for southern North American and European stock.  Mandatory restrictions on exploitation of salmon has not helped produced a positive stock level of salmon, as previously thought. The University of Maine, Marine Sea Grant has conduct scientific studies on the aquaculture of Atlantic salmon and collaborated to develop scientific methodology of factors affecting marine mortality in the inshore zone, as those influencing fitness of migrating smolt, those affecting the fish to move from fresh to salt water (and back) and the anthropogenic factors operating within the inshore zone.  The continuity and success of this comprehensive study is imperative to the NMFS mission in understanding how oceanographic variability influences salmon productivity and the effect on other living marine resources within a region.  The University of Maine posses the necessary knowledge and skills required to ascertain the scientific methodology to continue NMFS ongoing research program to alleviate reduction in survival of Atlantic salmon.   The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  The applicable NAICS code is 541690.   The size standard is $6,000,000.00.   All applicable awards shall be in compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12).  CAR clause 1352.239-73 Security Processing Requirements for Contractors/Subcontractor personnel for accessing DOC Information Technology Systems (Oct 2003) will apply.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to this requirement by August 9, 2007.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) hereby notifies of the intent to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in a negotiated procurement for fit out of the historic Building One under the Consolidation of the Food and Drug Administration Office of the Commissioner (OC) in White Oak, Silver Spring, Maryland.

The contractor will perform the construction in accordance with the design specifications, drawings and terms and conditions of the contract.  The estimated construction cost range is between $15-25 million.  The Construction Performance Period shall not exceed 600 calendar days.  Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 15.3.  The contract will be Firm Fixed Price.  The "Best Value Continuum, Tradeoff Process" is the method that will be used to evaluate price and other factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the best value to the Government in terms of performance, quality and pricing.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, without necessarily basing selection on the lowest price.  








The Technical Evaluation Factors are:  

I.  EXPERIENCE . (1) The offeror must demonstrate its past organizational experience as a General Construction (GC) Contractor responsible for the construction of at least two (2) Historic renovation projects, within the past ten (10) years, which is comparable in nature, type, and complexity to the project in this solicitation, and meets all the following characteristics: (a) New construction was for an office building including site, structural, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, interiors and fire protection systems;  (b) The project met one (1) of the following criteria: (i) The building size was not less than 50,000 gross square feet, or (ii) The construction cost at award of the construction contract was not less that $10 million for the complete building.

Considerations include: (1) Educational background; (2) Experience on similar projects in a position comparable to that for which they are being proposed; (3) Certification or professional registration held by the individuals proposed for key personnel positions.  

IV.  MANAGEMENT PLAN & SCHEDULE . This factor considers the plan being proposed by the offeror to execute the work contained in the contract drawings and specifications.  The Offeror must submit a proposed total contract duration in calendar days, which shall not exceed 600 calendar days (20 months) from the Notice to Proceed.  The duration proposed by the offeror, if successful on this procurement, shall become the official time of performance for this contract.  Considerations include:  (1) Submission of a detailed logic diagram, arrow-on-arrow (minimum 200 activities), illustrating the proposed sequencing of work and clearly defining the critical path.  Submittals, including shop drawings and samples and long lead time items should be indicated as separate activities; (2) Submission of a tabular schedule printout indicating, at a minimum, activity, activity duration and total float; (3) Submission of a narrative management plan describing how the offeror intends to execute the work in the field. Particular attention should be placed on the sequencing of work and on how the offeror intents to manage their subcontractors in order to ensure a smooth working relationship with the occupants of the building. The offeror should also discuss their procedures to ensure strict quality control relative to both workmanship and materials.  

V. SUBCONTRACTING PLAN. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business, however this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance. GSA expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment. Consequently, an offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) will be required to demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  If selected for award, the offeror?s subcontracting plan should be ready for approval without the need to obtain additional information.  The GSA goals for subcontracting are as follows: small businesses at least 41% of total subcontracting planned; small disadvantaged businesses at least 12% of small business subcontracting planned and small women-owned businesses at least 5% of small business subcontracting planned.  

VI. APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM: The Government will evaluate the means by which the Offeror shall promote the growth of skilled craft labor, specifically the contractor's use of a registered apprenticeship program.  (As used herein, the term "registered apprenticeship program" is a program that is registered with the United States Department of Labor or State Apprenticeship Council under 29 CFR Part 29.)

The General Services Administration will only make this RFP available electronically at www.eps.gov.  GSA intends to upload the RFP at this site on or about June 15, 2007.  This site provides instructions for downloading the RFP.  There will be no bidders' list established for this solicitation.

RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet.       (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).      (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.;CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)        (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet.      (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).        (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transpor!  tation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.      (d) RYG Classifications are summarized as follows:           (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.           (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.           (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.            (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.      (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.  FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address.  The request must include the requester’s name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NLSC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data.; Submit all quotations in accordance with the instructions included in the clause 52.212-1-INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 2006).

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Materials Division, AIR 4.3.4 at Patuxent River, MD plans to award a sole source Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) order in accordance with FAR 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) to METALAST, International, LLC for the Metalast anodizing process to provide for prototying  of technology on a component scale to bridge the gap from laboratory testing to full-scall testing on fleet assets.  NAVAIR needs the same METALAST proprietary technology already in use at NADEP JAX to allow for a direct hand-off of the transitioning processes.  Accordingly, METALAST International, LLC is the only firm with the unique knowledge, experience, technical expertise, and understanding of the METALAST anodizing process.  Award to any one other than METALAST International, LLC. would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Navy's requirements.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Responses to this notice can be sent via email directly to janeice.shall@navy.mil.

Enclosure (1)
The A&E must demonstrate his/her and each key consultant's qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors for all environmental engineering services and optional services.  Evaluation Factors are weighted with factors (1) through (5) being the most important, and factors (6) through (7) of lesser importance.  Additionally, factors (6) through (7) will be used as tie-breakers among technically equal firms.

6.  Firm location in the general geographical area of the contract and knowledge of the locality of the contract; provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract.  Firms should demonstrate the ability to support Navy and Marine Corps installations in the CONUS with regard to air related work, EPCRA related work and all other environmental works.  Firms will be evaluated on their proximity and familiarity with major fleet concentration areas of CONUS.

<DESC>NASA intends to award a sole-source contract extension to Siemens Communications, Inc. pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA's GSFC) Information Technology and Communications Directorate (ITCD). This procurement is to extend contract number NAS5-02032 for a period of up to 6 months from September 30, 2007 through March 31, 2008 and increase the maximum ordering value in order to allow sufficient time to award the follow-on procurement.   ITCD is currently finalizing their technical requirements in order to go forward with the most efficient and effective set of technical requirements for follow-on to the current Telecommunications Maintenance and Operations Support Services contract.  This extension is necessary to allow sufficient time for the competitive follow-on procurement.  This extension will allow for a continuation of current task orders issued, for modifications to existing task orders, and for new work until the Telecommunications Maintenance and Operations Support Services follow-on contract is awarded.  The contract extension and maximum ordering value increase are necessary in order to ensure program continuity and critical mission support and to avoid significant technical and programmatic impacts to GSFC.   The current contractor provides the following highly specialized mission critical services to NASA's GSFC ITCD: Responsibility for the continued day-to-day operation and maintenance support for the ITS which consists of six (6) Siemens Hicom 300 H Version 1 System Communications Servers, Phonemail, Automatic Call Distribution (ACD), Interactive Voice Response(IVR) System, Hicom Domain Management System (HDMS) Modular, Information Management System (Comsoft), and the Uninterruptible Power System (UPS); relocating existing equipment; performing new installations; providing new system design, testing and documentation, cable plant, and maintenance of ITS related data bases at GSFC.  At the Wallops Flight Facility (WFF), Wallops Island, VA site, the current contractor is responsible for continued day-to-day operation and maintenance support for two (2) Siemens Hicom 300 H Version 1 Communication Servers (one located at the Main Base and the other located at Wallops Island), Phonemail, HDMS, the Information Management System (Comsoft) and the UPS.	Due to the time and substantial duplication of costs involved in procuring and phasing in another contractor, Siemens is considered the only contractor capable of meeting NASA's GSFC needs given the short period of performance for the extension.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 PM. local time on August 20, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, NPPTL, Pittsburgh, Pa  requires sixty-five (65) OXY K Plus Self Contained Self-Rescuers for testing and evaluating, in the NIOSH Long-Term Field Evaluation.

Since collected SCSR?s must be replaced with like kind, NPPTL must procure the same number and model of units that are taken from the mines.  There are four models of SCSR?s in use in U.S. mines today. These include: the M-20 and EBA 6.5 that manufactured by Ocenco Inc.; the SR-100 that is manufactured by CSE Inc. and the OXY K Plus manufactured by Draeger Safety, Inc.  This procurement for Ocenco 6.5 SCSR?s   is one of four related procurements that will provide replacement M-20, EBA 6.5, SR100, OXY K Plus devices.   No other product can replace this unit in this regard because NIOSH must replace units taken from mines that use the EBA 6.5 SCSR?s (as described above) with the same model.   No other product will suffice.

Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within fifteen (15) days form posting date of this notice their capabilities statement and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed ten (10) pages. Please forward capabilities and supporting information to: DHHS/CDC/NIOSH, Attn: Gloria Gruber - Procurement Branch, PO Box 18070, Pittsburgh, PA 15236-0070,

The government will review any/all capabilities statements and supporting information submitted and determines if other qualified sources do exist that could perform the effort. Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

If no affirmative responses are received with fifteen (15) days, negotiations will be conducted with Draeger Safety Inc as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, NPPTL, Pittsburgh, Pa  requires sixty (60) CSE SR-100 Self Contained Self-Rescuers for testing and evaluating, in the NIOSH Long-Term Field Evaluation.

Since collected SCSR?s must be replaced with like kind, NPPTL must procure the same number and model of units that are taken from the mines.  There are four models of SCSR?s in use in U.S. mines today. These include: the M-20 and EBA 6.5 that manufactured by Ocenco Inc.; the SR-100 that is manufactured by CSE Inc. and the OXY K Plus manufactured by Draeger Safety, Inc.  This procurement for Ocenco 6.5 SCSR?s   is one of four related procurements that will provide replacement M-20, EBA 6.5, SR100, OXY K Plus devices.   No other product can replace this unit in this regard because NIOSH must replace units taken from mines that use the EBA 6.5 SCSR?s (as described above) with the same model.   No other product will suffice.

USAID/Philippines plans to fund the extension of the subject contract for a three-month period, from October 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007, under the authority of FAR 6.302 and as supplemented by AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5), where an award is for the continued provision of highly specialized services and award to another source would result in substantial costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable project delays. USAID/Philippines is in the process of a competitive full and open competition under solicitation 492-07-002 for a follow-on contract and it is essential to continue work efforts until an award is made under full and open competition. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any firm may submit capability information to demonstrate the ability to satisfy the Government?s requirement. Responses from firms received will be evaluated: however, USAID will not reimburse the respondent for any costs connected with providing such information. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition is solely within the discretion of the Government.

LBM, Inc. is the current provider of these services under contract N00421-02-D-3112, which will expire on 30 September 2007.  This contract is required to provide Transportation Services from 01 October 2007 through 31 December 2007.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Vanderbilt University, School of Medicine, 536 Robinson Research Building, Nashville, TN  37232 to perform analysis of PGE-M levels using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric method in 340 spot urine samples from the Shanghai Women?s Health Study. A reduced risk of stomach cancer has been associated with the use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in numerous epidemiologic studies.  The chemopreventive effects of NSAIDs are thought to be largely mediated through their roles in the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin (PG) production.  COX-2 plays a key role in diverse inflammatory conditions.  Of the PGs, PGE2 is a major prostanoid in gastric tissue and involved in various physiological and pathological functions of gastric mucosal cells.  It plays a critical role in maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity via several mechanisms including regulation of gastric mucosal blood flow, kinetics of epithelial cells, synthesis of mucus, and inhibition of gastric acid secretion.  It has been shown that gastric cancer tissues release higher levels of PGE2 than non-neoplastic mucosa, and gastric mucosal PGE2 production is higher in H. pylori positive gastric cancer patients than in H. pylori-negative patients.   Dr. Jason Morrow?s lab at the Vanderbilt University developed and validated an accurate and precise method to quantify PGE2 production in humans by measuring the major urinary metabolite of PGE2 (PGE-M, 11 alpha-hydroxy-9,15-dioxo-2,3,4,5-tetranor-prostane-1,20-dioic acid).  Subsequently, urinary PGE-M levels have been significantly associated with increasing risk of colorectal cancer in a dose-response manner in the Shanghai Women?s Health Study.  Similar to stomach cancer, a reduced risk of colorectal cancer has also been associated with the use of aspirin and other NSAIDs in numerous epidemiologic studies.  These findings suggest that PGE2 plays a role in gastric carcinogenesis, and that urinary PGEM levels may also predict stomach cancer risk.  However, to date, no study has evaluated the relation between urinary PGEM levels and stomach cancer risk.  The laboratory of Dr. Marrow at Vanderbilt University will perform the highly sensitive and accurate liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric method for measuring PGE-M levels on 340 spot urine samples.  No other laboratory has acquired the expertise in testing urinary PGE-M levels in human.  This method has been applied in a colorectal cancer case-control study nested within the Shanghai Women?s Health Study, and results have been published in the prestigious Journal of Clinical Oncology.  The proposed stomach cancer analysis is also nested within the Shanghai Women?s Health Study.  To facilitate evaluation of quality control and interpretation of results, it is important that the stomach cancer study have the same laboratory conduct the PGEM analysis.  Vanderbilt University is the only vendor known to the OEEB that can process these samples without the introduction of new variables into ongoing research.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, without introducing new variables into an ongoing research experiments it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on August 20, 2007. Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.

-	Programming of software:  requirements include microscope automation, automation of the process required for imaging of fluorescence probes and software that records the location of DNA probes across a slide with computer measurements from fluorescence images.  

Justification

NCI is interested in extending the capabilities of the current Olympus IX70 microscope to allow automatic capture of images of single replicating molecules.  This will allow the laboratory to obtain high-throughput information on replication events, and importantly, to obtain quantitative information on a large sample of replicating molecules that can be subject to statistical analyses.  The requested equipment will also expand the spectrum used for microscopic analyses to facilitate the use of multiple fluorescent probes, a requirement that will allow detection of multiple genes at the same time. 

This equipment is required for the expansion of ongoing studies.  In addition, the equipment will facilitate analysis of DNA replication patterns in a high throughput mode and will allow quantification of the data.  The new imaging system will also facilitate the concomitant use of multiple fluorescent dyes, affording analysis at a level more sophisticated than is currently available. Also, the NCI requires the BioVision Technologies components - Imaging System for automated screening of DNA probes to facilitated visualization and quantification of fluorescent signals on single DNA molecules in a high-throughput mode. 

The results of the NCI studies are expected to yield new information regarding the regulation of cell growth under normal conditions and under conditions that can cause them to become cancerous and the response of cells to drugs used in the treatment of cancer.  BioVision Technologies Inc is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the system and components compatible with the Olympus IX70 microscope.  Changing variables will be detrimental to the current research and studies in progress.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis for services regarding Evaluation of the Completeness Index Method in Estimating Complete Prevalence from Younger Registries with a Short Series of Incidence and 	Follow-up Data with The Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Roma.

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard in $11M.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106.

The aim of this project is to evaluate the performance of the completeness index method in estimating complete prevalence from data with short number of incidence and follow-up years; to provide some guidelines on the minimum number of years necessary for a good performance of the completeness index method and to suggest alternative methods combining data from older registries that will permit estimation of complete prevalence from data of a younger registry. 

Specifically the contractor shall use data from two registries - the historical Connecticut Tumor Registry (CTR) which contains incidence and follow-up from 1940 through 1996 and the New Mexico Registry (NMR). The CTR is chosen because it is the only registry that allows estimation of complete prevalence. The New Mexico registry contains incidence and follow-up from 1975 through 2003 and is chosen because it is distinct with respect to SEER-9.  1) Estimate incidence and survival models from a short range of data {(2003-l), 2003} for CTR and NMR, respectively, where l=5,?, 20; 2) Input the incidence and survival parameters estimates into the COMPREV software; 3) Use SEER*Stat to estimate l-year limited duration prevalence (LDP): 4) Import l-year limited duration prevalence into COMPREV; 5) Calculate completeness index and complete prevalence (CP) by COMPREV using: a) Registry specific incidence and survival parameters estimated from the limited data of length l and, b) SEER incidence and survival parameters; 6) Compare the complete prevalence estimates obtained in 5a )  and 5b) to different estimates of complete prevalence from the two registries: a) For the CTR compare with 67-year limited duration prevalence and, b) For the NMR compare complete prevalence obtained in 5) to: i) 29-year limited duration prevalence calculated from the NMR using the counting method (LDP(x,29)) and, ii) complete prevalence estimates using SEER parameters and NMR 29-year limited duration prevalence (CP(x,29,SEER)).

Period of Performance:  September 1, 2007 through August 31, 2008.

The Istituto Superiore di Sanita is the only source known that has developed the Completeness Index Method which is required to continue this ongoing NCI study.   The Istituto Superiore di Sanita has the knowledge and software required to perform these studies.  It is unknown to the NCI that there is any other source available that has the knowledge and software to provide these services.  Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to the current NCI studies in progress.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SOLNBR>W912DY-07-R-0048
<RESPDATE>090407
<ARCHDATE>11032007
<CONTACT>sarah.annerton, 256-895-1167
<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This synopsis publicizes contract actions proposed to support the US Army Engineering and Support Centers Facility Repair and Renewal (FRR) Program, A-E requirements.  The purpose of the FRR program is to support its various cu stomers throughout the Continental United States, District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories and possessions with their facility repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, addition, construction, equipment procurement/installation, and mai ntenance requirements.  In order to accomplish this objective, the FRR program proposes to award multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts, under which firm-fixed price (FFP) task orders may be issued for the provision of stand-alo ne Architect-Engineer (A-E) services.  The contracts will be procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  See numbered note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.   The North American Industrial Clas sification System code is 541330 and the size standard is $4,500,000.00.  The proposed contract ordering period is for one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods.  The total requirements expected to be awarded under the FRR A-E contracts are an ticipated to equal approximately $15,000,000.  The Government will conduct two separate competitions for award of ID/IQ A-E contracts to support the FRR A-E requirements (one unrestricted and one restricted for competition amongst 8(a) small businesses). This public announcement is for the unrestricted competition and is intended to result in multiple awards (approximately 2).  Of the total $15,000,000 programmatic capacity, the total capacity of $10,000,000 is estimated for the unrestricted MATOC pool whi ch will be shared amongst the awardees in the MATOC pool.  The A-E Contractors and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for an FRR construction (with design-build capabilities) contract (see W912 DY-06-R-0029, W912DY-07-R-0032, and W912DY-07-R-0033).  The A-E Contractors and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for an FRR construction (with design-build capabilities) award (see W912DY-06- R-0029, W912DY-07-R-0032, and W912DY-07-R-0033).  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  The highest ranked firm selected for negotiations will be provided a Request for Price Prop osal (RFPP).  If a mutually satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated, a RFPP package will be provided to the firm ranked next on the approved selection report.  This procedure would continue until all mutually satisfactory contract(s) have been negotiate d and awarded.  Placement of task orders will be consistent with FAR subpart 36.6, Architect-Engineer Services and subpart 16.5, Indefinite Delivery Contracts.  The Government will provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each task orde r exceeding $3,000 issued under the multiple ID/IQ A-E contracts.  The Government will consider award of the A-E task order to the 8(a) awardee prior to consideration of the unrestricted awardees.  If it is determined inappropriate to award the task order to the 8(a) awardee, the Government will then consider the unrestricted awardees for the task order award.  If the Government has information available to ensure that each awardee is provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each order, the Governme nt may not contact each of the multiple awardees under the contract before selecting an order awardee.  When selecting an order awardee the Government will consider:  a.   Capability to perform the level of complexity required for successful execution of t he task;  b.   Past performance on earlier orders under the contract, including quality, timeliness and cost control; c.   Potential impact on other orders plac ed with the contractor; and d.   Minimum order requirements.  Cost will not be an evaluation factor to be considered in selecting an order awardee.  Formal evaluation plans and scoring of quotes or offers will not be required.  The Government will give eve ry awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for a delivery-order or task-order exceeding $3,000 unless an exemption provided in FAR 16.505(b)(2) applies. PROJECT INFORMATION:  The Facility Repair and Renewal A-E contracts provide all services required t o prepare plans, specifications, work plans and other supporting documents necessary for execution of the FRR projects issued by task order.  As part of the design effort the contractor may be required to survey the problem areas, evaluate, and recommend s olutions.  The level of detail and format of the design packages may vary dependent upon the complexity of the FRR project.  A complete design, including a bid schedule, an order of work clause, a construction contractor submittal register, quantity and co st estimated, MCACES construction cost estimates, a proposed construction schedule, design analyses and calculations, a design document report, an engineering considerations and instructions report, and a draft operations and maintenance manual shall be de veloped for each project.  In addition to project designs the contractor may be required to conduct studies, investigations, surveying and mapping, tests, evaluations, consultations, comprehensive planning, program management, conceptual designs, value eng ineering, construction phase services, soils engineering, drawing reviews, preparation of operating and maintenance manuals, preparation of parametric estimates, equipment and systems commissioning and other related services.  In accordance with DFARS clau se 252.236-7009, Option for Supervision and Inspection Services, the Government may direct the A-E Contractor to perform any part or all of the supervision and inspection services for the construction contract.  SELECTION CRITERIA:  The selection criteria for the basic ID/IQ contracts are listed below and are equal in importance (first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion).  Criteria a-e are primary.  Criteria f-g are secondary and will only be used as tie-breakers among firms that are essent ially technically equal.  a.  Specialized experience and technical competence in:  (1)  Design of new facilities and design of renovations of facilities including but not limited to Barracks, Office/Administration facilities, Laboratories, Command Operatio ns facilities, Warehouses, Morale Welfare Recreation/Non-Appropriated Funds facilities, and support functions of facilities (generators, power, water, steam); (2)  Experience of the prime firm and significant subcontractors (i.e. any subcontract which equa ls 10% or more of the prime contract) in working together; (3) Experience in adapting standard design packages.  The adaptations should demonstrate space conversions (warehouses to offices for example), working with existing systems in renovating portions of facilities; (4) Rehabilitation of existing facilities of various types, sizes, and complexities;  (5) Application of Anti-Terrorist/Force Protection criteria;  (6) Design of projects on Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Veteran Affairs, State Department, Department of Interior, Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, and state and local government facilities; (7) Specific technical capabilities, such as construction cost estimating, scheduling, value engine ering and materials testing.  The technical capabilities should demonstrate the type of equipment or software used and the need for subcontractors to perform these tasks; (8) Knowledge of specific laws, regulations, building codes and criteria that are enc ountered in the design of government and private facilities; (9)  Bentley Microstation CAD software, necessary equipment to run software, USACE A/E/C CADD stand ards, production of PDF files for advertisement and the ability to convert CAD production source files into fully functional, error free files of AutoCAD and other required CAD products; (10) Design quality management approach.  Specifically, how will the contractor maintain the quality of the design and cost control. What system is in place to assure the design quality is maintained?  b.  Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services.  The Government will consi der the qualifications, experience, and training of licensed, registered, and/or certified key personnel.  Resumes shall be provided in Section E for the following key personnel:  architect, structural engineer, civil engineer, mechanical engineer, electri cal engineer, communications engineer, fire protection engineer, geotechnical engineer, land surveyor, safety engineer, interior designer, cost engineer, project manager, and landscape architect.  Also provide the resume for a Leadership in Energy and Envi ronmental Design Accredited Professional (LEED-AP), which can be one of the personnel listed above.  c.  Past performance on recent (i.e. performed within the past three (3) years from the release of this announcement) DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules, as determined from Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and other sources.  PPIRS will be queried for all prime firms.  Performance evaluations for any key subcon tractors will also be considered.  Any credible, information on past performance can be considered, but a board is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm if none is available from PPIRS.  d.  Capacity to accomplish the wor k in the required time.  The Government will consider the firms ability to make available an adequate number of interdisciplinary teams to accomplish at least five (5) task orders simultaneously.  e.  Capability to perform work throughout the Continental United States, District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories and possessions.  Firms should demonstrate their capability to perform work in multiple geographic locations.  Greater consideration will be given to the A-E firms with the capabilit y to perform work in diverse locations rather than only having experience in one geographic area.  f.  Extent of participation of small businesses (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minority i nstitutions (MI) in the proposed contract team, measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU, or MI is a prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner.  The greater the participation  the greater the consideration. g.  Volume of work awarded by DoD during the previous 12 months, with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms, including small businesses and small disadvantaged busine sses.  A large business concern, upon notification that it is the apparent successful offeror, must submit a small business subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers co nsiders the following goals reasonable and achievable for the performance of the resultant contract:  (i)  51.2 % of subcontracted amount contract amount with small business concerns. (ii)  8.8 % of subcontracted amount contract amount with those small bus iness concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.

(vii)  Negotiated% subcontracted amount contract amount wi th those concerns owned and controlled by Minority Institutions.  Note that the goals are expressed as a percentage of the total contract, not percentage of subcontracting.   The small business subcontracting plan is only required from Large Business offer ors selected for award and is not required with the initial proposal submission.  SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be eligible for award.  Firms may register via the CCR internet site at h ttp://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This synopsis publicizes contract actions proposed to support the US Army Engineering and Support Centers Facility Repair and Renewal (FRR) Program, A-E requirements.  The purpose of the FRR program is to support its various cu stomers throughout the Continental United States, District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories and possessions with their facility repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, addition, construction, equipment procurement/installation, and mai ntenance requirements.  In order to accomplish this objective, the FRR program proposes to award multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts, under which firm-fixed price (FFP) task orders may be issued for the provision of stand-alo ne Architect-Engineer (A-E) services.  The contracts will be procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  See numbered note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.   The North American Industrial Clas sification System code is 541330 and the size standard is $4,500,000.00.  The proposed contract ordering period is for one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods.  The total requirements expected to be awarded under the FRR A-E contracts are an ticipated to equal approximately $15,000,000.  The Government will conduct two separate competitions for award of ID/IQ A-E contracts to support the FRR A-E requirements (one unrestricted and one restricted for competition amongst 8(a) small businesses). This public announcement is for the 8(a) restricted competition which is intended to result in a single award.  Of the total $15,000,000 programmatic capacity, the total capacity of $5,000,000 is estimated for the 8(a) award.  The A-E Contractor and its su bcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for an FRR construction (with design-build capabilities) award (see W912DY-06-R-0029, W912DY-07-R-0032, and W912DY-07-R-0033).  Placement of task orders will be con sistent with FAR subpart 36.6, Architect-Engineer Services and subpart 16.5, Indefinite Delivery Contracts.  The Government will provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order exceeding $3,000 issued under the multiple ID/IQ A -E contracts.  The Government will consider award of the A-E task order to the 8(a) awardee prior to consideration of the unrestricted awardees.  If it is determined inappropriate to award the task order to the 8(a) awardee, the Government will then consid er the unrestricted awardees for the task order award.  If the Government has information available to ensure that each awardee is provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each order, the Government may not contact each of the multiple awardees und er the contract before selecting an order awardee.  When selecting an order awardee the Government will consider:  a.   Capability to perform the level of complexity required for successful execution of the task;  b.   Past performance on earlier orders un der the contract, including quality, timeliness and cost control; c.   Potential impact on other orders placed with the contractor; and d.   Minimum order requirements.  Cost will not be an evaluation factor to be considered in selecting an order awardee.  Formal evaluation plans and scoring of quotes or offers will not be required.  The Government will give every awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for a delivery-order or task-order exceeding $3,000 unless an exemption provided in FAR 16.505(b)(2) applies. PROJECT INFORMATION:  The Facility Repair and Renewal A-E contracts provide all services required to prepare plans, specifications, work plans and other supporting documents necessary for execution of the FRR projects issued by task order.  As par t of the design effort the contractor may be required to survey the problem areas, evaluate, and recommend solutions.  The level of detail and format of the des ign packages may vary dependent upon the complexity of the FRR project.  A complete design, including a bid schedule, an order of work clause, a construction contractor submittal register, quantity and cost estimated, MCACES construction cost estimates, a proposed construction schedule, design analyses and calculations, a design document report, an engineering considerations and instructions report, and a draft operations and maintenance manual shall be developed for each project.  In addition to project de signs the contractor may be required to conduct studies, investigations, surveying and mapping, tests, evaluations, consultations, comprehensive planning, program management, conceptual designs, value engineering, construction phase services, soils enginee ring, drawing reviews, preparation of operating and maintenance manuals, preparation of parametric estimates, equipment and systems commissioning and other related services.  In accordance with DFARS clause 252.236-7009, Option for Supervision and Inspecti on Services, the Government may direct the A-E Contractor to perform any part or all of the supervision and inspection services for the construction contract.   SELECTION CRITERIA:  The selection criteria for the basic ID/IQ contracts are listed below and are equal in importance (first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion).  Criteria a-e are primary.  Criteria f is secondary and will only be used as a  tie-breaker among firms that are essentially technically equal.  a.

<DESC>NOTE: The text that follows is intended to replace the entire notice published November 15, 2006 and subsequent modification published November 16, 2006.

INTERMITTENT CONTRACTOR/SUBJECT-MATTER EXPERT (SME). Background: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates numerous international training and assistance programs in various countries throughout the world which address the entire range of customs and border control operations. To effectively implement these programs, there is a need to obtain the services of skilled and knowledgeable individuals (i.e., contractors) on an intermittent (short-term) basis. Short-term or intermittent is defined as a single assignment for 180 calendar days or less. Intermittent Contractors (ICs) will be required to perform various tasks such as those associated with training, utilizing specialized equipment, or to provide professional and technical assistance in specific topical areas. The following is a delineation of the types of general services that ICs are expected to provide under their contracts, as required. A more specific description of services or tasks shall be identified and provided to the ICs upon selection and award of an order/contract. 
       
TRAINING: The IC shall serve as a subject matter expert and/or presenter. He/she may be required to present customs or border control training based on an existing CBP curriculum. Instruction may include, but is not limited to, the areas of narcotics interdiction, port security, customs investigative techniques, money laundering, intellectual property rights, control of weapons of mass destruction, commercial import/export operations, or customs valuation. In general, the topic and contents of the course will be established, in advance, with course material normally provided by CBP. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training to serve as an instructor in general and in specific areas of instruction.

COURSE DEVELOPER: The IC shall develop a set of course materials on a given topic for later presentation by either CBP personnel or in-country advisors. Courses to be developed could be in any customs or border control-related areas such as those described for TRAINING above. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training in course development for one or more related areas.

ASSESSMENTS: The IC may conduct on-site assessments of customs administrations and other border control agencies located in foreign countries. Assessments may be general in scope or geared to specific areas (e.g., control of weapons of mass destruction, assessment of aviation equipment assets or of aviation programs, intellectual property rights, etc.). Tasks could include such actions as physical border surveys, and broader surveys of the entire governmental enforcement system. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the necessary experience and skills to complete an authoritative and professional review of the specific agencies or programs, and to prepare summaries, analyses, recommendations, trip reports, and/or other written work product(s).

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: The IC may provide technical assistance in highly specialized areas such as legal reform, inspectional technology (high and low tech), port security, or specialized field operations. For example, in the area of legal reform, tasks may include the review of customs laws and regulations of a country, making recommendations for improvements, and/or providing technical assistance in the preparation of new laws and regulations that meet the needs of a specific country. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess specialized knowledge, experience, and background related to specific areas of expertise.

AUGMENTATION and REPLACEMENT: The IC may augment a technical team or temporarily replace a technical team member. As an additional team member, the IC will undertake general or specific tasks associated with various projects such as the development of an interagency taskforce or the review of personnel policies. As a replacement or fill-in, the IC may replace and assume the tasks of a technical team member who may be away from post for an extended period of time. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess the necessary knowledge, experience, and skills to serve as an additional team member, or replacement member.

TERMS and CONDITIONS: Most IC assignments will be less than 30 days, with adequate advance notice given prior to assignment/deployment. Some IC assignments may last up to 180 calendar days. It is not envisioned that an IC would be on duty more than 180 days in a calendar year. If an IC declines more than two assignments, he or she may be excluded from further consideration at the discretion of CBP. 

POSSIBLE DUTY LOCATIONS: ICs must be willing and able to work in any country in which CBP conducts operations. CBP training and assistance projects are currently ongoing in all regions of the world.

COMPENSATION and OTHER REIMBURSEMENTS: 1) ICs will be compensated for their performance on a fixed-priced basis at the rate of $2,400.00 per week for all ICs or prorating thereof (i.e., $480.00/day, $60.00/hour), for the period of time estimated by CBP for completion of the assignment, excluding travel days. 2) All authorized hours worked will be paid at the above hourly rate. 3) There are no provisions for an overtime or premium rate. Work is generally to be performed during the normal workweek however, the Contractor may work on weekends and be compensated at normal hourly rate (i.e., $60.00) with the express authorization of the Contracting Officer and/or Program Manager. 
 
OTHER REQUIREMENTS: 1) Prospective ICs may be required to undergo updated background investigations to obtain a SECRET security clearance from CBP. If for some reason a clearance cannot be granted, the prospective IC may be excluded from consideration from any assignments calling for such clearances. 2) For some specific assignments, foreign language ability may be a requirement for selection. 3) All materials provided to or developed by the IC under a contract are the property of CBP, may not be released to any other party without express permission from CBP, and are subject to return to CBP upon conclusion of the contract or otherwise upon receipt of a request from CBP.

TRAVEL: All travel will be under U.S. Government travel orders (separate and apart from the contract) and in accordance with applicable U.S. Government travel regulations. ICs will be reimbursed for all official travel upon completion of a travel voucher in accordance with an approved travel authorization. The IC will be responsible for purchasing airline or other common carrier tickets subsequent to approval of travel. ICs are not authorized to receive an advance for expenses for lodging, meals and/or travel incidentals. The embassy will be making travel arrangements in country. Travel time to and from the United States is not compensable for pay purposes. 

CONSIDERATION of APPLICANTS: Interested individuals are to submit their qualifications in resume format, to be accompanied by a completed CBP - QUESTIONNAIRE FOR INTERMITTENT CONTRACTOR available at FedBizOpps (accompanies this Notice). Beginning with the date of this notice, all applicants must submit the most recent revision of the questionnaire (currently Rev 8-07) in order to be considered.

In order to ensure that full consideration is given, applicants are encouraged to review the form OF-612, available at     http://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/of612.pdf. A copy of the 2002 version available at the above website at the time this notice was published is also available at FedBizOpps. Applicants are encouraged to review the information and topics covered on the OF-612 form and ensure that their resumes contain the same data elements that appear in that form. Applicants should NOT use the form OF-612 for the purpose of submitting an application, however.

Resume packages (i.e., resume & completed questionnaire) will be accepted by e-mail only. 

APPLICANTS ARE TO SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATIONS AND RELATING DOCUMENTS TO: 

CBP.IC@dhs.gov. 

DO NOT SUBMIT TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICE STAFF. No acknowledgement will be made by CBP upon receipt of the resume. Please, no phone calls. 

NOTE: Applicants who applied previously are to submit new application packages in accordance with the guidance and requirements herein, to include a completed questionnaire.

METHOD of SELECTION/OPERATION, INSURANCE and PHYSICAL EXAM REQUIREMENTS: The CBP Office of International Affairs will evaluate the resume and questionnaire packages received for technical ability. CBP may exclude any applicant from consideration if it is unable to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of his/her qualifications from the documents submitted. Qualified and otherwise acceptable candidates will then be added to a Qualified Bidders List from which ICs are selected and may be awarded an order/contract for one or more assignments in the future as needs arise. Prospective ICs must be physically fit, able to perform the duties of an assignment and may be required to obtain a physical examination and certification that they are fit for travel anywhere in the world for assignments up to 180 calendar days. If selected for a contract award and CBP elects to require that the prospective IC obtain a physical, CBP will reimburse the IC for reasonable actual costs (not to exceed $500.00) by including this item on the order/contract, as described above. ICs may be required to obtain emergency evacuation insurance coverage. If so, the order/contract document will provide for reimbursement of reasonable actual costs for this coverage (not to exceed $500.00). 

REQUIRED REGISTRATION @ WWW.CCR.GOV: Prospective ICs must be registered in the government CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR) system at www.ccr.gov prior to issuance of an order/contract. CBP strongly recommends that applicants complete their registration as soon as possible after submitting an application. The process involves input of business information and registration with Dun and Bradstreet to obtain a D&B number. Applicants must include their D&B/DUNs # on the questionnaire (see above). 

ORDER/CONTRACT DOCUMENT: As indicated above, once CBP identifies a requirement and selects a prospective IC, a CBP Contracting Officer will prepare a suitable order/contract document in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (i.e., FAR, viewable at     http://www.acqnet.gov/far/ ). The contract document will contain the detailed statement of work for the specific assignment, including services required, estimated time required, country/destination, travel dates, materials and topics to be addressed, and other applicable information. 

ORDER ISSUANCE, COMMENCEMENT OF PERFORMANCE, ORDER CEILING: Applicants selected for an assignment and contract are not to commence performance or initiate travel until they receive and accept an order/contract in writing. The duration of contract performance shown on the contract document and resulting dollar amount constitutes a ceiling, beyond which the IC performs at his/her own risk. If needs arise which call for the IC to provide services for an additional period of time, the Contracting Officer will issue a modification which provides authorization for continued performance within specified limits.

ORDER/CONTRACT INVOICING and PAYMENTS: Payments are processed by CBP in arrears, in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act as implemented by FAR clause 52.232-25. ICs are to submit an invoice for services rendered under their contract no more frequently than once per month (in arrears), unless otherwise specifically authorized in the order/contract document. It is suggested that ICs submit their monthly invoice during the first week of each calendar month for services performed during the previous calendar month. IC monthly invoices must comply with the requirements of FAR 32.905. Travel-related reimbursements are handled separately in accordance with applicable travel regulations as indicated in the text above.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS: All taxes (federal, state and/or local) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) income reporting requirements are the responsibility of the IC as a 1099 type vendor. 

NOTE: This announcement is not an offer of employment and any resulting order issued by CBP is not an employment contract. Resulting orders are for the services of a suitable Contractor. This Notice is being published on an annual basis and supersedes previous notices for intermittent contractors issued by CBP. This Notice remains in affect until canceled or superseded. Applicants must realize that CBP requirements for the services described above occur on a sporadic basis and there is no assurance or guarantee that a respondent to this notice will receive an order/contract for the services described herein.

The Indian Health Service (IHS), Division of Engineering Services, Dallas (DES) in support of the Phoenix Area Indian Health Service, is seeking a qualified firm for the renovation of entire Ft. Duchesne Health Clinic HVAC system, Ft. Duchesne, Utah.                                                                                                                                                                  

RFP/HHSI161200700145C:  SCOPE OF WORK:  The existing pneumatic HVAC control system and all associated equipment and devices for the clinic are to be replaced with a new direct digital control (DDC) system.  This work includes replacing existing control valves, dampers, space sensors, and all required programming, network cabling, etc., required to put the system into full operation.  The central plant HVAC control system shall be integrated with the DDC system proposed above.  The system will be programmed to allow remote monitoring and control of the plant equipment.  The existing central air-handling unit serving the building will be reused, but will have the fan speed increased.  The existing motor will be replaced with a larger, high efficiency motor that is capable of meeting the new CFM and static pressure requirements of the system.  The quantity of outside air entering the unit will also be increased as required by the current building occupancy.  A new filter bank will be added and will serve as the final filter section.  The existing split system air conditioning unit will be reused, but retooled to only serve the Computer Data Room.  The existing exhaust fan EF-10 will be replaced.  All other exhaust fans will be reused.  In response to complaints of dust entering the building through the existing sidewall exhaust louvers, new hooded shields will be installed at the existing louvers.  The existing hot water baseboard heaters will remain, but the wall-mounted thermostat will be replaced with a control valve at the heater.  The existing chilled water system will be reused, but the existing pneumatic controls will be replaced with DDC controls.  The existing heating water system will be reused, but the existing pneumatic controls will be replaced with DDC controls.  All of the existing spaces will be re-balanced.  All of the existing ductwork will be cleaned.  Convert one general patient exam room into a Triage Isolation Room.  This will require modifying existing plumbing, electrical system and mechanical system.  Remove the room from the return air system and provide a dedicated exhaust system that provides 100% exhausting of the space.  This space shall be maintained at negative pressure at all times.  A new room pressure monitor will be added to verify that the space is kept at a negative pressure and will alarm if the room pressure relationship changes.

The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, supplies, transportation, equipment, supervision and any and all necessary items for a complete and useable project.  All work shall be performed in a workman like manner, in complete compliance with all applicable industry standards, manufacturer?s specifications and warranty requirement to meet Government approval.

FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and  solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable.   Amendment 0001: Correction:    This synopsis, which originally appeared in the FedBizOpps on 13 July 2007 for Ruggedized Personal Computer/Display Unit, is hereby modified to read as follows: 1.	Change from: anticipated issue date 31 JUL 2007 – anticipated closing date 14 AUG 2007 – 2:00 PM CST.  Change to:  anticipated issue date 7 AUG 2007 – anticipated closing date 21 AUG 2007 – 2:00 PM CST.   2.	Change from:  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Advaned Processing Labs (AP Labs), 10864 Thornmint Road, San Diego, California, 92127, under the authority of  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is that AP Labs, being the Original Equipment Manufacturer, is the only know source fo reach of the items that can satisfy the Government’s requirements, and it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Change to:  The Government intends to solicit on a full and open competition basis.   3.	Change from: Interested parties may respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Change to:  Interested parties may respond to the requirement or submit proposals. 4.	Numbered Note 22 is hereby deleted.

<DESC>XBot Solicitation Amendment 06 The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) has a requirement to procure small robotic systems, spare parts and training in support of the Robotic Systems Joint Project Office (RSJPO).  This procurement will be comp eted on a two step, technically acceptable, low price basis.  Bidders will submit a technical proposal and two bid samples to be evaluated on a test range to determine product technical acceptability.  The Government intends to invite those bidders deemed to have a technically acceptable product to participate in a reverse auction.  The resulting contract will be a five year Firm-Fixed price IDIQ contract with a maximum quantity of 3000 robotic systems, spare parts, operator and maintenance training, and va rious documentation support.   Delivery Order 0001 will be concurrently awarded and will consist of (101) robotic systems, which will satisfy the guaranteed minimum quantity of the above referenced contract.  Delivery Order 0001 will also include, (1) sess ion of Maintainer training, (1) session of Operator training, and (10) spare parts kits.  The spare parts kits will consist of all items necessary to produce a robotic system and will be supported by a Bill of Materials listing the bidders part numbers, O EM part numbers, and unit price for each item.  A spreadsheet will be delivered via E-mail to all auction participants prior to the start of the auction to facilitate bid submissions.  This spreadsheet will be in Microsoft Excel format and have parameters set to allow for range pricing at larger quantities and will be used to establish the ceiling amount of the resulting IDIQ contract and the pricing structure for future delivery orders.  Please ensure you review Clause 52.214-10 when establishing your aver age price.  Especially paragraph (e) referencing unbalanced pricing and the contracting officers recourse.      Description of Need: A Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) has been received by the RSJPO requesting accelerated procurement of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to be used for Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detection and identification.  Th is contract effort addresses the need of United States military forces to acquire commercial off the shelf/non-developmental items (COTS/NDI) that can be immediately produced upon contract award.  The xBot, which is a generic name that will be used until c ontract award, consists of a remote controlled robotic platform, operator control unit (OCU), and a transportation case.   The selected robotic system and associated spare parts will be used in direct support of contingency operations Outside the Continent al United States (OCONUS).  Required capabilities include a small, wireless, remote controlled Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) system platform that weighs 50 pounds or less excluding any external payloads, and an OCU that weighs 20 pounds or less.  Technical  acceptability will be measured using a Go/No-go technical acceptability matrix.  The performance criteria, as well as a proposed acquisition schedule, are addressed in the following Exhibits that are attached to the solicitation in Section J: Exhibit (A)  Performance Requirement for the XBot # MIS-PRF-56596 Rev. B Exhibit (B)  Requirements Compliance Matrix Exhibit (C)  Xbot Technical Demonstration Plan Exhibit (D)  CDRL XB002 through XB007 (Un-priced) Exhibit (E)  XB001 Safety Assessment Report (Priced) Exhibit (F)  XB008 Reliability Report (Priced)  Exhibit (G)  CDRL Submission Form Attachment (I)  EOD Quality Assurance Checklist (referenced in the Statement of Work) The Bid Sample assessment will occur at Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville, Alabama on a predetermined test course to validate technical acceptability of the proposed UGV.  The sample assessment will be in accordance with the above attachments.  Bidders must mee t all the technical requirements identified in the technical acceptabil ity matrix to continue in the bidding process.  The Technical Matrix, with specific points of performance to be evaluated, is located in attachment B. The winning bidder shall provide two complete systems within 10 working days after contract award.   It is anticipated that delivery of an initial quantity of 5 systems will be required 45 days after contract award.  The delivery schedule for the remaining  94 systems and ten spare parts kits will be identified in the formal solicitation.    Ensure you review all of the documentation because some have changed from the last posting.  Attachment (I) was added to the zip file for your reference and use.  The Clause 52.212-3 for representations and certification was inadvertently left out of the s olicitation.  Please ensure you update you electronic submissions prior to the date listed below.  I have left the following information in this section for your reference from the last modification.  The Specification Exhibit (A) and the X-Bot Technical D emonstration Plan Exhibit (C) have been updated.  The following clauses, FAR 52.219-28 and 52.217-6 have been added.  In addition, the delay in posting the solicitation has resulted in the necessity to adjust the date of the Reverse Auction.  It will now b e held on 4 September 2007.  There were some minor changes in Section L. of the solicitation.  There were also some questions added to the bidders question list and some instructions and hotel information listed there as well.

<DESC>Sources Sought No. W912HY-07-S-0017 Project Title:  Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, Texas, Rehabilitate East and  West Locks in Matagorda County, Texas. The U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers, Galveston District has a requirement for the above subject.   This is not a Solicitation Announcement and is not a Request for  Proposal and does not obligate the Government to any contract award.  The purpose of this Sources Sought synopsis is to determine interest and  capability of potential qualified Small Business Administration (SBA),  Certified 8(a) Small Business, Hubzone Small Business, and Service  Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business firms relative to the North  American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 237990.  The Small  Business Size Standard is $31.0 Million.  To make an appropriate  acquisition decision for the above project, the Government will use  responses to this sources sought synopsis.  The order of magnitude for  this effort is $1 Million to $5 Million. Project Information: The work  consists of the contractor shall provide all plant, labor, equipment and  materials to Rehabilitate Sector Gates. After pressing the upper and  lower pins and bushings out of the hinges, the contractor has to  transport the sector back to its installed location where he will install  new upper and lower pins and bushings and then connect and align the  gate's drive mechanisms. The work will be conducted in a manner so as  to obstruct navigation as little as possible, and traffic will be stopped for  a maximum period of 12 hours each day before the waterway is opened  back up to allow un-restricted flow of traffic for a period of not less than  12 hours. If the level of the Colorado River rises and currents increase to  the point where tows cannot safely cross the river and the lock is not  operational, marine barge industry will have no choice but to wait until  the river goes down. Such a move would cripple barge service to and  from major petro-chemical and other facilities along the Texas Coast.  Emergency Reinstallation and Removal of Sector Gates. In the event of  heavy rains or anticipated floods on the Colorado River, the contractor  shall be prepared to put the sectors back into service within 48 hours  after it is so directed. The work includes the removal of the recess  fenders, reinstallation of sectors with or without seals but with a  minimum of three complete lines of fenders, restoring the sectors to  normal operating conditions for the duration of flood, then removing the  sectors and giving each a thorough wash down with fresh water before  resuming the work to be done. The cathodic protection system need not  be installed during emergency conditions. The contractor shall complete  the entire work and ready for use not later than 365 calendar days after  acknowledgement of Notice to Proceed. This work will be performed on  Government property; therefore, the contractor shall be required to  provide insurance in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) 28.307-2, Liability. In addition, the contractor shall be required to  submit a Felony Criminal Records (History) for each contract employee  scheduled to work on this proposed project. NOTE: (1) If the decision is to  Set-Aside for Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, or SBA  8(a) Small Business, the contractor shall be required to perform in  accordance to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14 Limitation  on Subcontracting (b) states The concern will perform at least 15  percent of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials,  with its own employees. NOTE: (2)  If the decision is to Set-Aside this  procurement for HubZone Small Business, the contractor, shall be  required to perform in accordance to 13 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR)  SUBPART 126.700. (b) (1) A qualified HubZone SBC prime contractor  receiving a HUBZONE contract for general construction may mee t this  requirement itself by expending at least 50% of the cost of the contract  incurred for personnel on its employees or it may subcontract at least  35% of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel to one  or more qualified HUBZone SBCs. A qualified HUBZone SBC prime  contractor may not, however, subcontract more than 50% of the cost of  the contract incurred for personnel to non-qualified HUBZone SBCs.  NOTE: (3) If the decision is to Set-Aside for Service Disabled Veteran- Owned Small Business, the contractor shall be required to perform in  accordance to 13 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) SUPART 125.6 (b) (2)  In the case of a contract for general construction, the SDVO SBC spends  at least 15% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel  on the concern's employees or the employees of other SDVO SBCs.

<DESC>NOAA's Acquisition & Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1),  with the Environment Canada (EC) Air Quality Research Branch to carry out regular measurement programs of greenhouse gas mixing ratios and stable isotopes of carbon dioxide.  The NOAA Global Monitoring Division (GMD) and EC measurements from air samples collected at the Canadian Arctic station at Alert have previously been carefully compared by the two laboratories, providing a foundation for further collaborative measurements.  Collaborative measurements must be carried out in order for GMD to meet the North American goals of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program.  GMD requires the regular, long-term measurements discussed above, within a network of carefully chosen sites in North America, to study the variation of greenhouse gases with height, which will enable GMD and other scientists to quantify the predicted North American terrestrial biosphere?s net uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  Quantifying the North American carbon budget and identifying implications for the global carbon cycle are priority items outlined in the U.S. Climate Change Science Program Strategic Plan.  Period of performance shall be October 1, 2007 to September 30, 2008.  EC operates the BERMS site in Canada where GMD requires these measurements to be carried out.  This site is a secure facility with limited access.  In addition, EC already has personnel in place with the required expertise in the air sampling and analysis that is required.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This notice is issued for information only.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, firms that believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to NOAA's program may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is issuing this Sources Sought Notice to determine if there is an adequate number of interested SBA certified 8(a) firms, HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concerns capable of providing multi-media services.  These services have historically been set-aside and awarded exclusively to small business concerns.

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has embarked on a proactive effort to promote several new initiatives as well as the long-standing and successful bio-medical research programs. Promotional material design is underway, and many of the supporting design concepts are being created with the support of multi-media contractors.  A critical component of an effective NIEHS promotional effort hinges on an in-depth understanding of the initiatives and demonstrated ability, by the multi-media contractor, for providing services and  producing products that successfully communicate highly technical science and public health programs to both scientific and lay public audiences.

The successful contractor will be required to adopt many of the design concepts and styles recently developed for NIEHS and its initiatives, while facilitating a progression of the ?visual identity? in promotional and branding efforts.  To that end the NIEHS requires a contractor capable of providing the personnel, materials, and professional expertise to plan, analyze, and create visual solutions to communication challenges.  The contractor will be tasked with finding the most effective way of conveying a message in print, electronic and film media using a variety of methods such as color, type, illustration photography animation and various print layout techniques. 

The broad categories of the multi-media services include: a. consultations on design or implementation of any task, b. custom photographic services using digital or film as requested, c. providing  graphic design services ranging from simple line drawings to the most complex graphics, d. video projects from concept development to completion and from production to post production, e. meeting and event support to ensure the needs of planners and presenters are met regarding room setup, audio-visual support, options and associated costs and  f. providing a typed monthly report to the NIEHS  that includes a listing of all completed work orders, and shows final costs. 

Responses to this sources sought will be used by the Government to select an appropriate procurement method to fulfill the requirement above. The contract performance period will be for a base year and four one year option periods and is projected to begin on 01 October 2007. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541430. The business size standard is $6.5 million. Interested candidates should include the following in their response:  a. Capability statement, limited to fifteen pages, detailing the qualifications and capability of the firm to complete the type of work described above.  b. Identification and verification of the company as a SBA certified 8(a) firm, HUBZone small busniess, Service-disabled veteran owned small business, Small business, Veteran owned small business, Small disadvantaged business or Women-owned small business. c. The size of the business.   Contractor teaming arrangements are encouraged. This sources sought synopsis should not be construed as a request for proposal from the Government. Submittals will be used for market survey information only. Responses to this sources sought notice shall be mailed to James E. Bryant, Jr. P.O. Box 12874, MD NH-02, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, 27709-5001 or e-mailed to bryant5@niehs.nih.gov .    Telephone responses will not be accepted. Responses must be received no later than Friday 20 July 2007 at 3:00 p.m. EST.  .

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHS/S&T) is interested in identifying potential vendors with prototype Shoe Screener systems for Government- conducted laboratory assessment.  TSA is interested in establishing a Qualified Products Listing (QPL) as a method to regulate equipment used in Registered Traveler (RT) services provided by a commercial security provider to supplement and/or expedite passenger processing through airport checkpoints.  S&T is conducting market research in support of this TSA future need and anticipates releasing a Request for Information (RFI) to identify sources for prototype systems that are sufficiently mature for laboratory assessment.  System maturity should be Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or 7 defined as System/Subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment.  In other words, the system should be suitable for field testing by a typical Transportation Security Operator (TSO) at a commercial airport.  The preliminary goals for a Shoe Screener have been coordinated with TSA/CTO and will be incorporated in a Technical Requirements Document (TRD) as part of the RFI to industry.  TSA and S&T are interested in a system capable of detecting a wide variety of military, commercial and home made explosives that may be concealed in commercially available shoes (or any type of foot-wear).  The system should be capable of detecting explosives, either concealed in shoes or traces of explosives on passenger shoes or legs to a height of 18 inches from the floor without the passenger having to remove their shoes.  The Government anticipates establishing a Bailment agreement with each industry participant prior to delivery of any prototype system for lab assessment.  A sample Bailment agreement will be included with the RFI.  Companies will be provided access to testing data but not the Government assessment of their system.  Testing data may be determined to be Sensitive Security Information (SSI) or may even be classified in accordance with appropriate Government Security Classification Guidance documents.  US citizenship is a prerequisite to receiving SSI.  Vendors that may be interested in responding to this RFI are requested to notify the S&T contracting officer, Ms. SusanKelly Haskett at 
202 254-6897.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY:  EXPLOSIVE HAZARD, ANTI-PERSONNEL, AND ANTI-TANK MINE DETECTION, MARKING & NEUTRALIZATION SYSTEM. The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC) Acquisition Center-Washington (ACW) on behalf of the US Army Research Devlopment and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communications-Electronic Research Devlopment and Engineeri ng Center (CERDEC), Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Countermine Division, Dismounted Soldier Applications Branch is conducting a market survey to identify companies having technology, qualifications, and capabilities to demonstrate  a small, robotic, ground-vehicle mounted sensor or munitions technology to remotely (1) detect surface laid and buried, metallic and non-metallic, antitank and antipersonnel landmines and scatterable munitions; (2) to detect surface laid, partially buried , and camouflaged explosive hazards; (3) to mark lanes and detected targets; and (4) to neutralize detected hazards. NVESD, Countermine Division is seeking mature technology in this market survey.  Maturity for this market survey is defined as a minimum technology readiness level (TRL) of 6 or a clear path to demonstrate TRL 6 or higher within 12 months.  Results of this  market research may be used to formulate a near term program that integrates sensor and munitions technology onto a small robotic platform. This future program may include the following Performance Objectives: (1) Detection of landmines and explosive thre ats with a high probability of detection (Pd).  Pd:  90% (T), 99.6% (O). (2) A high forward speed while detecting and marking along a specified route which contains mines or explosive hazards emplaced according to threat doctrine:  0.4m/min (T), 5m/min (O) .  Note that a false alarm rate (FAR) is not specified.  It is implicitly constrained by the need to mark a safe lane. (3) Neutralization of landmines and explosive threats with a probability of neutralization of 90% in one attempt. (4) Marking of targets within 10cm of edge of target. (5) The ability to operate in limited visibility and over difficult terrain. And, (6) A scaleable detection sensor that will allow operation in narrow, confined spaces.  Additional Technical Objectives may include (1) Integra tion of an existing or modified prototype detection and neutralization system with an existing or modified GOTS or COTS small robotic platform that includes a soldier operated interface; (2) Performance and environmental testing of the prototype or demonst ration model by the contractor to verify technology maturity; and (3) Support of limited testing by soldiers to verify suitability for production and deployment.   This is NOT a Request for Proposal.  The objective of this market survey is to solicit an expression of interest from industry and organizations through White Papers that supports the companys claim that it presently has the technology, qualifications, an d capabilities to satisfy one or more of the performance and technical objectives described above.  The White Paper should discuss the companys sensor or munitions and performance test results. Documentation supporting a maturity level of at least TRL 6 o r an approach to maturing the companys technology to at least TRL 6 within 12-months should be provided.  This documentation should provide a simple logic train supporting the argument for TRL 6, but need not be exhaustively rigorous.  The White Paper sho uld also discuss related company experience and include point(s) of contact.  The white paper should be prepared in MS Word, limited to ten (10) pages, and submitted electronically to the Contracting Officer, Michelle Hodges, at michelle.hodges@us.army.mil  within 30 days.  The Army may require the technical experts from the Institute of Defense Analysis (IDA) to assist in the evaluation of White Papers ensuing from this notice.  Such non-government personnel will be bound by appropriate non-disclosu re agreements to protect proprietary information. The submittal of a White Paper shall constitute acknowledgement and acceptance of the Governments use of IDA. The Government will not reimburse interested sources or responders to this notice or any follow -on notice for any costs incurred in responding, or for subsequent exchanges of information.  All requests for further information must be made in writing or via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.

<SUBJECT>F--Wildlife Water Catchment Tanks, Patent No. 6073583
<DESC>Description: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) at the New Mexico State Office intends to negotiate with only one source, Boss Tanks, 7861 East Idaho St, Elko, NV  89802 to acquire 5 each wildlife water catchment tanks.  This action is authorized by and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  The Government believes that the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency's requirement is Boss Tanks of Elko, NV for Wildlife Water Catchment Tanks  (Patent number 6073583).  The requirement calls for an 1800 gallon storage catchment tank, cross-linked polyethylene with bird ladder and 1.25" pre-installed overflow pipe adapter. The wildlife water catchment tank shall be manufactured of rotationally molded high density crosslinked polyethylene with ultraviolet inhibitors, suitable for watering wildlife. Wall thickness shall be strong enough to contain fluids of 1.65 specific gravity and to withstand solid freezing.   Capacity of the catchment tank shall be 1800 gals at a 24" high drinker level. The assembled cover and tank shall be no more than 8.5' wide by 16' long to allow transport to the field without special permits. The catchment tank including the cover shall be strong enough to withstand elk, cattle, and snow loads without collapsing, puncturing, or cracking.  The cover shall easily attach/detach for transporting and field placement.    The cover shall attach to the tank with 3/8" stainless steel bolts, nuts, and washers to preclude rusting. The total weight of the tank and cover shall be about 800 pounds.   The cover shall have a minimum 17 inch inside diameter manway to allow access to the tank for cleaning. The drinker shall be integral to the tank and require no float valves to function. .  The water holding portion of the tank shall be seamless one piece construction to eliminate potential leaks.  The drinker and small animal ramp are to be molded of the same crosslinked polyethylene into the cover to reduce maintenance created by separate parts. Catchment tank and cover shall be dark brown in color. No painting shall be required, the color of the tank shall be inherent to the tank material. The catchment tank shall be constructed so it can be partially buried (up to the drinker lip if required) to acheive a maximum above ground level of 20 inches. The estimated value of this simplified acquisition is less than $31,000.00.  No request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued and no response will be made to letters or telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation. This is not a request for competitive quotes, but serves as a procurement notice to fufill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).    The requirement is unrestricted and the NAICS code 326199 applies. Responsible firms believing they can provide the required items are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice to the Contracting Officer referencing action item GDQ079004.  However, they must provide convincing evidence that they can furnish the requested items at a cost that will not exceed the total estimated transaction cost. All of the responses will be fully considered. If no affirmative responses are received by August 15, 2007 to the effect that a comparable source exists, an order will be placed with Boss Tanks for the requirement stated here. Questions concerning this acquisition may be directed to Mary Ann Crafton-Williams at 505-761-8946 or faxed to 505-761-8911.

<SUBJECT>B--Notice of Intent to Award - Northern Spotted Owl Survey Protocol to Agricultural Research Foundation, OSU Strand Agriculture Hall, Suite 100, Corvallis, Oregon 97331-2219
<DESC>Existing northern spotted owl survey data determining spotted owl occupancy within demographic study areas will be analyzed.  Much anecdotal evidence and 2 published research articles suggest that barred owl presence may be having a "suppression" effect on the detection rates of spotted owls.   The purpose of the protocol evaluation will be to update the survey protocol due to the potential influence of barred owls on spotted owl detection probabilities.  Several protocol related questions will be addressed in this analysis, these include:  How many surveys (i.e., nighttime or daytime) are needed to adequately detect spotted owls in the presence of barred owls?  How many years of surveys are needed to infer that a spotted owl site is unoccupied?  Do these results vary by province and/or state?  Both the Principal Investigator and research analysts on this project are on staff at Oregon State University (OSU).  The project will rely on datasets that are anticipated to come from at least 6-8 spotted owl demographic areas located in Washington, Oregon and California.  The demographic areas are affiliated with OSU, the U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, and the USDI Bureau of Land Management.   Both the Investigator and analysts have already conducted similar analysis for an Oregon study area.  Anticipated products from the protocol evaluation include:  1) revisions, if any, in the amount of survey effort and timing of surveys is needed, due to barred owl presence, 2) probabilities associated with amount of survey effort and spotted owl detection rates with barred owl presence, 3) survey effort needed with no barred owls present, 4) what is the duration of surveys needed before concluding a site is unlikely occupied by spotted owls in the presence of barred owls, and, 5) what, if any, variation across the provinces exist for the above results?

2.	Description of Supplies/Services:
We are requesting that the Language Testing International (LTI) perform Foreign Language testing on our CBP employees who are entitled to participate under the existing FLAP agreement and those who may be covered by new or future FLAP agreements.

The Oral Proficiency Interviews (OPIs) conducted by LTI will be rated on the scale established by the Federal Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) which is currently used by the CBP Foreign Language Awards Program.  Given the projected number of employees that are required to be tested for foreign language proficiency (approximately 5,000) it will be necessary for Customs and Border Protection to secure LTI in order to assure adherence to both the current and future FLAP settlements and agreements.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Mosaic Transparent Armor
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Mosaic Transparent Armor 


Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license and commercialize the technology to make Mosaic Transparent Armor.

Description:	Mosaic Transparent Armor provides a means of making windows which are made up of small transparent tiles which are bonded together.   These tiles are usually made of glass/ceramics or other impact proof, high performance material.   The tiles are bonded together with a transparent adhesive having an index of refraction which matches the index of refraction of the tiles, so that the seams and joints between tiles are virtually invisible. The use of mosaic tiles restricts the damage from an impacting projectile to a small part of the window's total area. This localization of damage gives the window the ability to withstand multiple impacts while still providing visibility through the undamaged portions of the window. Windows made from mosaic tiles can provide equivalent performance at a lower weight than current state of the art.    The technology also permits the use of smaller transparent tiles to fabricate a larger window at a lower cost.

Potential Applications:  This technology is useful for producing bullet and explosion resistant glass for use in cars and armored trucks.    It could also be used for window glass for use in areas with hazardous conditions.

Advantages:  Mosaic Transparent Armor has several advantages over current transparent armor which is made from one continuous piece or a laminate layers of transparent materials.    These advantages are as follows:
?	Damage is localized to the impacted tile.
?	Can use smaller tiles of transparent material which are easier and cheaper to fabricate.
?	Can provide equivalent performance at a lower weight.  

Development Status:  LLNL is currently working on prototype Mosaic Transparent Armor windows made of transparent glass/ceramic tiles.    LLNL has also filed a Provisional Patent Application covering the invention.   
To see a demonstration picture of the Mosiac Transparent Armor, go to:
http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/profile/announcement/MosaicTransparentArmor.php  

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Mosaic Transparent Armor should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

P.O. Box 808, L-795
Livermore, CA  94551-0808
Attention:  FBO 154-07

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Mosaic Transparent Armor technology.

The estimated start date is July 27, 2007 and the estimated maximum end date is January 26, 2008.   The sole source is to prevent a lapse in service during negotiation and award of multiple contracts under RFP# 263-2006-P(GM)-0247 for Patent Legal Services.  RFP# 263-2006-P(GM)-0247 was posted to www.fbo.gov on March 2, 2007.  This action is under the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 as it is impracticable to seek competition for the three to six month period while negotiations under RFP #263-2006-P(GM)-0247 are active.  Interruption of service would result in significant harm to the U.S. Government in the loss of intellectual property rights in the United States and foreign countries in connection with multiple patent cases.

<SUBJECT>--NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order to Learfield Communications, Incorporated. This company's physical address is 505 Hobbs Road Stop 1, Jeffferson City, Missouri  65109-1088. The award will be made for the purchase of a advertisin g package marketing the Tennessee Army National Guard. This marketing effort will concentrate on marketing activities with the University of Memphis, Tennessee during the 2007 football season. This procurement is being conducted under FAR Part 6.302-1, for  Other than Full and Open Competition and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to USPFO for Tennessee Contracting Division Attn: Major John W. Anders, PO Box 41502 Nashville, Tennessee, 37204, or sent by email to john.anders@ng.army.mil . Te lephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted. Responses to this notice must be submitted by 3:30 PM CST, Friday, August 10, 2007. A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.  The point of contact for this announcement is John Anders, Contract Specialist, at john.anders@ng.army.mil.  1.	This request for justification for other than full and open competition is for an on-site advertising package for the University of Memphis's Fo otball program.  The recommended vendor to fulfill this requirement is the company of, Learfield Communications, Incorporated.  This company is under contract with the University of Memphis for marketing activities for the 2007 football season.  The Tennes see Army National Guard would like to use this company to market them during the home games for the 2007 football season.  This kind of concept for this particular venue is not otherwise available to the Government. 2.	In an effort to increase the number of people enlisting in the Tennessee National Army Guard (TNARNG) on a game day representatives from the TNARNG shall be allowed to set up a Game Day display in order to educate spectators about the opportunities avai lable in the Tennessee Army National Guard. 3.	The total estimated value of this advertising package shall not exceed $40,000.00. 4.	The Statutory Authority as noted in the Federal Acquisition Regulation part 6.302-1 is satisfied based on the fact that there is only one (1) responsible source for fulfilling this requirement in the vicinity of Memphis, Tennessee, and that there are no  other supplies or services that will satisfy the agency requirements for this particular requirement. 5.	The University of Memphis is the largest collegiate football team in West Tennessee and is the only sports organization in the area with the potential to provide an advertising media capable of reaching the desired number of people in the demographic gr oup that the Tennessee Army National Guard wishes to recruit. 6.	Efforts to solicit other contractors have not been made as the University of Memphis is the only collegiate football team in the West Tennessee for this particular venue capable of reaching this desired number of people in the demographic group that the  Tennessee Army National Guard wishes to recruit. 7.	The anticipated cost of this acquisition is determined fair and reasonable by comparison of prices proposed in other advertising packages of this nature. 8.	Efforts were made to identify other sources of competition by searching for vendors registered under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541850 for Display Advertising in Tennessee.  No other sports teams in the West Tennes see area were identified in this search that could provide an advertisement package as required for this particular except for, Learfield Communications, Incorporated. 9.	Learfield Communications, Incorporated is the only responsible source identified in the market research that could provide an advertising package of this type in the West Tennessee area. 10.	Based upon the market research conducted by this office there were no other sources that could have expressed an interest in this acquisition. 11.	No actions to remove barriers to competition will be taken, as the University of Memphis is only collegiate football team in West Tennessee who can provide advertising to potentially reach the desired number of people in the demographic group for poten tial recruits into the Tennessee Army National Guard. 12.	This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>Title:  USMC Training and Education Command, Technology Division, Joint Capability Integration and Development System Support, Squad Immersive Training Environment (SITE)  NAICS CODE:  541512 - COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES PRODUCT CODE:  D - Information technology services, including telecommunications services. PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for modified-commercial items prepared under FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, and prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information in this request.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and this announcement constitutes the solicitation request.  This requirement is being issued by GovWorks under the franchise authority of the Department of the Interior on behalf of the U.S. Marine Corps Training and Education Command (TECOM), Technical Division  THIS IS A SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.  NAICS CODE:  541512  / Size Standard:  $23 mil The U.S. Marine Corps Training and Education Command (TECOM), Technical Division has a requirement for technical support in the successful development of the Joint Capabilities Integration Development System (JCIDS) research and analysis to complete a Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) that will culminate in a Squad Immersive Training Environment (SITE) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD).  The goal of SITE is fuse current, emerging, and future live and virtual technologies to create a fully immersive live/virtual training environment that:  1. Replicates as closely as possible the effects and conditions of the battlefield; and 2. Allows a dismounted infantry squad to effectively train in the wide spectrum of tasks necessary to execute the full ROMO.  This capability will build on the training value found in current simulations such as ISMT-E and laptop-based procedural trainers, serving as a supplement to live-fire exercises and also filling gaps that neither live nor virtual training can sufficiently address.  It will add realism through the replication of conditions and effects on the battlefield to create intense, stressful, challenging training scenarios that accelerate the decision-making cycle and provide instant, tangible feedback.  Combining live and virtual systems, it should be scalable and reconfigurable and with variable scenarios.  This analysis effort will review other programs such as the Deployable Virtual Training Environment (DVTE) which was designed to sustain the individual and unit critical war-fighting cognitive skills associated with the application of combined arms by the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) during "en-route" and deployed periods.  Another program, the USMC Live, Virtual, Constructive - Training Environment (LVC-TE) will provide expanded training and mission rehearsal capabilities that are a closer approximation of the true operational environment.  The LVC-TE will provide distributed training and facilitate joint war-fighting conditions through a networked system of interoperable training sites and deployable capabilities that thoroughly integrate personnel, doctrine, training and technology.   This analysis effort will leverage existing and emerging training technologies such as, but not limited to, weapons and marksmanship trainers such as the Indoor Simulated Marksmanship Trainer (ISMT), vehicle and crew-served gunnery training systems (PGTS, AAV-TT), tactical convoy simulation systems (VCCT, RVS, MPRI), indirect fire and forward air control simulation systems (CAN, I/FACT, MSAT, JTC-TRS), and command and control training simulations (CACCTUS, MTWS). ***The competitive Request for Quote (RFQ), specifications, RFQ amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement can be accessed via the Internet at http://www.govworks.gov/Solic/openmarket.asp under RFQ number 1406-04-07-RQ-67950.   Interested parties must respond to the RFQ in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via email to mary.carver@mms.gov no later than August 13, 2007, 12:00 pm EDT.  Ensure the RFQ number and project title is referenced on all correspondence.  The RFQ closing date is on or before 2:00 pm EDT, August 31, 2007.

DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES 
Following items will be provided: 
CLIN: 0001; Description: Exhibit booth space (8? x 10?); Quantity:  Twenty-three (23) 
Period of Performance:  24 September 2007 through 26 September 2007. Place of Performance Marriott Wardman Park Hotel, Washington, DC. 20008

JUSTIFICATION
The 12th Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB intends to award a contract on a Limited Source basis to acquire 23 exhibit display booths AFMA/RM.  The Marriott Wardman Park Hotel and the Omni Sheraton Hotel have been selected to host this year?s CSTEA participants.  The CSTEA has been scheduled for September 19-27, 2007.  Part of the CSTEA plan calls for exhibition displays, a ceremony, and a reception.  As participants in the CSTEA program, twenty-three (23) competing CSTEA teams are required to set up exhibition display booths to network and dialogue on their process improvements.  The Air Force Association (AFA) has selected the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel to host the AFA National Convention.  In the Government?s better interest, market research conducted by AFMA supports a determination made by the planning committee to hold the exhibitions, ceremony, and reception portion of the CSTEA program in the same facility where the awards and convention activities are scheduled to take place.  The AFA has leased the entire Marriott Wardman Park Hotel for September 24 ? 27, 2007 and has designated areas for exhibitions to be held during the convention at the Hotel.  During CSTEA 2007, the AFA is the office of primary responsibility for setting up the AFA National Convention and the sole source for the rental of all areas within the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel.   The CSTEA planning committee recommends the AFA National Convention as the source to satisfy the CSTEA requirement.  The AFA convention is tailored to the professional requirements of Air Force enlisted, officers, guardsmen, and reservists.  Furthermore, it provides AFMA a unique opportunity to promote the CSTEA program in an exclusive environment.  The effectiveness, spirit, and moral boost achieved by AFMA?s CSTEA Program will deteriorate considerably if AFMA is unable to secure exhibition booths and space as required by the CSTEA program.  Market research identified no other vendors providing compatible services within the Marriott/Omni vicinity during the CSTEA scheduled time frame.  For these reasons it is determined that no source other than the AFA can meet this requirement.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES    (JUN 2006)
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(End of provision)
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has a requirement for a liquid helium cryostat.



1.0 Specifications:

Line Item 0001: 1 Each liquid helium cryostat with optical tail, meeting the following specifications

1)	Minimum liquid helium and liquid nitrogen hold time of 72 hours. This hold time should take into account the heat load due to the windows and wiring described below, as well as an expected 200 mW extra power dissipation into the helium bath.
2)	The experimental region will be about 8 in. diameter and about 7 in. tall. The bottom tail/cold plate will be detachable (with an indium seal) to allow access to the helium bath region from below.
3)	A total of five UV-grade fused quartz windows, each having a clear aperture of 0.75 in. and o-ring sealed to a detachable tail. Four windows will be located along the radial directions at a maximum distance of 5 in. from the cryostat axis. Another window will lie along the axis of the cryostat at its bottom.
4)	110 phosphor-bronze twisted pair leads and 5 flexible coaxial cables running from suitable feedthroughs in the top plate of the cryostat to the cold plate with suitable heat-sinks to the liquid nitrogen and liquid helium baths. The coaxial cables will have a typical attenuation of 7 db per 100 ft at 1 MHz or less.
5)	A liquid nitrogen cooled detachable heat shield surrounding the experimental region. This will include slots to allow wires to pass through to the experimental region, as well as holes for the optical access.
6)	A welded flange at the middle to allow for supporting the cryostat at that position on an optical table.
7)	The overall height of the dewar and optical tail will allow easy cryogen filling within a limited ceiling clearance of 92 inches above the optical axis.
8)	A diode thermometer on the cold plate wired to suitable measurement electronics including a digital temperature display.
9)	A liquid helium level sensor (superconducting wire type) installed inside the dewar and wired to suitable measurement electronics with a digital level display.
10)	A liquid nitrogen level sensor (capacitance type) installed inside the dewar and wired to suitable measurement electronics with a digital level display.
11)	Complete leak checking at room temperature, liquid nitrogen and liquid helium temperature, with a final liquid helium test to monitor the helium evaporation rate of the cryostat and to insure 72 hour hold time for both cryogens under the expected heat load described above.
12)	 Delivery time:  3-5 months after receipt of order

Line Item 0002:  1 Each suitable liquid helium transfer line for filling the cryostat from standard transfer dewars

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This solicitation is set aside exclusively for small business concerns.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  Solicitation Number NFFK0007-12418 is issued as a request for quotations.  The associated North America Industry Classification System code is 511210.  The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS), has a requirement to conduct economic analysis of fisheries policies.  The government requires 2004 Implan Data for Coastal Counties.  To that end, specialized data and software helps in the analysis of the impacts of NMFS policies on local economies. For example, the data will help answer whether area closures affect the financial viability of some communities more negatively than others.  The data will also allow the analysis of the impact of our policies on boat-builders, fish processors, and other industries closely tied to the commercial fisheries at a detailed geographical level.  Additionally, the data also helps in the analysis of how policies will impact recreational fishermen.  Some policies may induce fishermen to undertake other recreational activities which would affect the economies of coastal communities.  The government requires the actual economic model and county level data files for the entire U.S.  As a result of this synopsis, the government anticipates a single award.  NMFS previously purchased IMPLAN data in 1995 and in 1998 and updated the data sets.  The government requires the base data using national economic data, and currently requires the 2004 updated data sets.  The government's estimate for this data is $33,000.  Delivery is required within 30 days of award.  The contract deliverables shall be Implan 2004 data for coastal counties (CLIN 0001).  The award will be made on a best value basis.  Best value evaluation factors include the following: 1) Approach: The likelihood of effectively meeting requirements; 2) Past Performance: The relevance and quality of prior performance; and 3) Price: The amount, realism and consistency of the evaluated price.  The solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18.  The provisions and clauses may be downloaded at http://www.acqnet.gov/far.  The following provision and clauses shall apply to this solicitation:  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Nov 2006).  The Government will award a single fixed price purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  i) approach, ii) past performance, and iii) price.

PROJECT TITLE

CRIS Data Mart Development and Implementation 

BACKGROUND

The mission of the Department of Clinical Research Informatics (DCRI) is to guide the appropriate use of information technology to enhance clinical research, patient care, and hospital management.  DCRI is responsible for the infrastructure that supports the technology for all mainframe, client-server, desktop computers and its accompanying application management/development, database information.   DCRI provides technical advice and supports the NIH/CC and the new Clinical Research Center (CRC) through the operations, development and management of administrative and business software applications while supporting as many as 4, 500 users. 

Currently, DCRI supports a Clinical Research Informatics System (CRIS) which is the electronic health record for all patients receiving treatment at the NIH Clinical Center.  There are plans for a full data warehouse as part of phase 2 of the CRIS project.  The goal of the CRIS Data Mart is to provide a copy of the CRIS transactional database to allow access for data queries as an interim step to the data warehouse.  The queries would be for a single patient or aggregate data.   This project focuses on the analysis of the functional need, the development of design options that support the work processes, and the development, testing and implementation of the option chosen along with documentation to support the maintenance and support.

The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors â€“ Commercial, applies  to this acquisition.  52.212-2	EVALUATIONâ€”COMMERCIAL ITEMS (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to  the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be  most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The  following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Technical Performance: ARDEC is looking for a versatile Low Voltage  Transmission & Scanning Electron Microscope (LVEM) to enhance the material  characterization capabilities at ARDEC. The LVEM shall have three imaging  modes (Transmission Electron Microscopy â€“ TEM, Scanning Electron Microscopy â€“  SEM, and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy â€“ STEM) and Electron  Diffraction in a compact, bench top footprint. The LVEM shall be stand-alone  in that it can be installed in practically any environment, uses minimal space and requires no peripherals for operations â€“ no cooling water and no special  electrical source. The LVEM shall allow high contrast imaging of light  elements and high contrast profile imaging of light or heavy element particles  in micron and nanometer scale. The LVEM shall allow for a quick and seamless  transition between various imaging modes. Finally, the system shall be easy to  operate at low cost.  Ease of Operation: The LVEM shall allow for a quick and seamless transition  between various imaging modes. The control and analysis software must be easy  to use and straight forward. Step-by-step operation and software manuals for  the LVEM and all applicable attachments must be included. Maintenance: The system shall require little regular maintenance and shall be  operational greater than 90% of the time.  At least a one-year warranty must  be included that shall cover all hardware and software including any  computers.  If required, the vendor shall visit ARDEC during the warranty  period to perform any required repair and adjustments.   Training: The contractor shall provide several days of in-depth operation and  applications training for the LVEM, each attachment and all applicable  software modules.  This training should be geared to ARDEC specific  applications. The cost of training shall be included in the price of the  system. Service: The contractor shall provide any required service and technical  support for a period of one year from the date of commissioning. Furthermore,  the contractor shall provide the details of a post warranty service contract  before the end of first year. For minor technical  or operational problems with the LEVM, the contractor shall provide a  telephone/e-mail support and response within twenty four hours.  Cost: If all other factors are determined to be equal between multiple vendors  then cost will be used as the final determining factor. For evaluation purposes, the relative order of non-cost factors is as follows:  Technical performance is the most important criteria. Ease of operation is  significantly less important than technical, maintenance is significantly less  important than ease of operation, training is significantly less important  than maintenance, and service is significantly less important than training. The relative importance of the non-cost factors is significantly more  important than cost.  The award will be made based on the best overall (i.e. best value) proposal  that is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government with  appropriate consideration given to the non-cost factors and price. The  Government will weight any increase to technical rating against any additional  price to determine if parity of the relationships warrant the paying of  additional price for the higher rating. However, price may become more  significant in the event of rating competing proposals are closely grouped. The following adjectival ratings shall apply to all non-cost factors: Blue  (Outstanding) A proposal that satisfies all of the Governmentâ€™s  requirement with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and  shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant  strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses with an overall low degree of  the risk in meeting the Governmentâ€™s requirements. Green  (Good) A proposal that satisfies all of the Governmentâ€™s requirements  wit adequate detail too indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an  understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or  numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall  low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Governmentâ€™s requirements. Yellow  (Acceptable) A proposal that satisfies all if the Governmentâ€™s  requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of approach and shows  a minimal understanding of the problems, with a moderate to high degree in  meeting the Governments requirements. Orange  (Marginal)  A proposal that satisfies all of the Governmentâ€™s  requirements with minimum detail to indicate the feasibility of the approach  and shows a minimal understanding of the problem with and overall high degree  of risk in meeting the Governmentâ€™s requirements. Red  (Unsatisfactory)  A proposal that contains a major error(s) of deficiency (s) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that  cannot be expected to meet the requirements of involves a very high risk and  none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision  of proposal.  The relative importance of the non-cost factors is significantly more  important than cost.  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding  the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option  prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate  the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise  furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified  in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by  either party. Before the offerâ€™s specified expiration time, the Government may  accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations  after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before  award.

All work shall be  accomplished in Building 353, Vehicle Maintenance Facility, Altus AFB OK.  

2.  PRINCIPAL FEATURES:  The work to be accomplished consists, in general, of the following principal items.

Lift will be installed in bay where lift #2 was located, last maintenance bay (south end) in building 353.

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and?
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or

52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items.
As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows:
Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
Price and Past Performance
This is a ?Best Value? Solicitation. Price and past performance shall be utilized to determine the ?Best Value? to the government. When combined Past Performance is significantly more important than price.  In the event the low price offeror has a high confidence past performance rating award shall be made to that offeror and the evaluation process shall stop there. The government reserves the right to award to other than the low offeror if that offeror represents the ?Best Value? to the government.
Offeror must submit not less than three (3) and not more than five (5) Past Performance references. At least three (3) references must provide completed past performance questionnaires.  Completed questionnaires shall be submitted to 375 CONS/LGCB, Attn:  Debbie Tupman, 201 E. Winters, Bldg 50, Scott AFB IL 62225-5015 or via e-mail to deborah.tupman@scott.af.mil .
 (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

PROJECT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOLLOW:

1) Question-What sort of video input sources will you be using with the projectors(DVI, VGA, Composite, component)? We need specific information so the cables can be made accordingly. Please list all that apply. Answer-Composite AV is one source, the second one is VGA for the replacement projectors and composite AV for the new install with second input as component.

2) Question- Where is the video cabling being routed to? The distance of each cable run is important as well as if this it to be interior an existing wall or inside an exterior-wall conduit. Answer- The cables are each 45? to 50? average and are routed to/from PC and VCR within the room, typically at the front of the classroom. All cables are above ceiling tiles and or inside hollow walls. 

3) Question-How far away from the power source will these projectors be? It would be most cost effective if there is a uniform length you want the power cords to be made. Answer- Power source is next to each projector and standard length power cords are needed.

4) Question- What sort of surface will these be mounted to (joist beams, false panel ceiling, other)? Again, digital photos would be helpful. Answer-False panel ceiling.

5)  Question- Is cabling required for 4 new installations?  Answer- Yes. 
5a) Question- If so what is average length of cable run. Answer- Cable runs will average 45? to 50?.

6)  Question-Does repositioning mean simply adjusting a mounted projector or moving projector and mount to other part of the room?  Answer- It could be either since not all projectors have the same distance throw to fill the 96?X74? screen, so you may have to do a minor zoom adjustment or maybe move the projector and mount forward or back in order to obtain the correct image size.

A building diagram showing projector locations and digital photographs of classrooms and existing projector setup are available.  If you would like copies OR have additional questions, please email your request to frank.spencer@maxwell.af.mil.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT: This is a pre-solicitation notice. The action code K-Combined Synopsis/Solicitation is listed in error and is hereby void.

The United States Coast Guard (USCG) intends to enter into negotiations on a sole source basis with Rockwell Collins, 400 Collins Road, N.E, Cedar Rapids, IA 52498 to provide fifty-eight (58) URG-III High-Power High Frequency Radios. The proposed acquisition will be for six (6) months from the date of the award for the following:

(A)Part Name  
(B)Part Number 
(C)Quantity 

(1)RT-2200  
(ii)822-0906-003
(iii)58

(ii)270-2615-010
(iii)58

(3)Audio panel
(ii)270-2772-030
(iii)58

(4)PR-2025
(ii)270-2586-010
(iii)58

The Contractor shall supply the URG-III High-Power High Frequency Radios to the following locations (quantities in brackets):

?USCG Communication Station Kodiak AK ? Ten (10) URG-III HF Radio systems

?USCG Communication Station New Orleans LA - Eight (8) URG-III HF Radio systems

?USCG Communication Station Honolulu HI - Six (6) URG-III HF Radio systems

?USCG Communication Station Boston, MA ? Ten (10) URG-III HF Radio Systems

?USCG Communication Station Miami, FL ? Five (5) URG-III HF Radio systems

?USCG CAMSPAC ? Seven (7) URG-III HF Radio systems

?USCG CAMSLANT ? Twelve (12) URG-III HF Radio systems

?10 Fleet Spares

Installing URG-III High-Power High Frequency Radios allows the USCG to be interoperable with the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) over the Horizon Enforcement Network (COTHEN) system. This interoperability allows the USCG to reduce our current stand-alone HF system from 123 HF High Power Transmitters to 79, saving approximately $9M.  Supply systems and support structures are already in place for the URG-III High-Power High Frequency Radios within the Department of Homeland Security. Converting or updating this system would require several million dollars and will add additional delays. In addition, updating the existing USCG Radio Remote Access Control Software (RADRACS) software for a different radio would cost approximately $1M. Combining the COTHEN/USCG HF systems supports the Department of Homeland Security Strategic Goal/Policy to make the various operating agencies within the Department interoperable. A common system for the Department of Homeland Security improves the security posture of the nation, increases mission effectiveness and better serves the taxpayers. This URG-III High-Power High Frequency Radios interfaces with the HF cellular Automatic Link Establishment network which is controlled by the Rockwell Collins remote control console used by CBP and USCG forces. The USCG developed RADRACS, which currently controls the URG-III High-Power High Frequency Radios and would have to be modified to control a different radio with no guarantee of interoperability within the CBP and USCG networks as well as increasing costs and delays.
