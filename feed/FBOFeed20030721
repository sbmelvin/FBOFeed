<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Development of an Early Flight Fission Test Facilities (EFF-TF) Realistic Reactor Ground Test Program Plan.  This involves determining how to advance the EFF-TF capabilities from prototypic testing to flight qualification and validation.  Tasks to be performed include the following: (1) review and assessment of current Program Master Plan, current and optional conceptual designs of space nuclear reactor power systems, and current status of materials, fabrication processes, critical technologies, and test facilites to support research, concept investigations, concept validations, and component and system design validations and verifications; (2) identification and assessment for selected space nuclear power system options; (3) identification and assessment of selected non-nuclear ground support and ground test equipment; (4) identification and assessment of the Space Reactor Flight System Factory through launch testing requirements; (5) identification and diagnostic assessment of component, subsystem, and system testing strategies and test plans; (6) identification and assessment of the launch vehicle, space power system, and payload interfaces; (7) identification and assessment of the facility resources required to support the factory through flight demonstration of the selected Space Reactor Flight System(s); and (8) perform technical support tasks as required by EFF-TF. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology under the authority of FAR 13.106 for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  To properly address the aspects necessary to flight qualify a nuclear system from a non-nuclear testing standpoint, it is necessary that the contractor have demonstrated experience in non-nuclear testing of nuclear space flight systems and with actual nuclear testing of space units that have resulted in flight.  New Mexico Institute is 1 of only 2 facilities that have performed realistic non-nuclear testing of nuclear systems (the other is NASA/MSFC) and is the only facility in the US that has tested flight reactor units (topaz reactors).  Therefore, New Mexico Institute is the only source with the facilities and expertise to perform this effort. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 5, 2003.  See Note 25 for description of the information that must be provided.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>NA DESCRIPTION:   This synopsis replaces the previous synopsis for solicitation DAAE07-03-R-L513.  All future actions related to this work effort will be listed under DAAE07-03-R-L514.  The United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments CommandÃ¢Â€Â™s (TACOM) Ground Vehic le Simulation Laboratory (GVSL) seeks to select a contractor to create design plans, and an option to subsequently fabricate, a reconfigurable crew cab.  The crew cab will serve to simulate the ride, spatial, visual and sound parameters, air quality, and p hysiological effects on the human body experienced by typical occupants while riding within the internal crew compartment of various Army ground combat vehicles traveling across bump courses.

<DESC>The National Science Foundation is soliciting proposals for utility, medium-lift, fixed-wing flight services from ski-equipped DeHavilland DHC-6 “Twin Otter” or equivalent aircraft to support its polar research programs; i.e., the United States Antarctic Program (USAP), and the National Science Foundation’s Arctic Program.  The USAP is this nation’s national program of scientific research in Antarctica, and includes the activities of NSF and other U.S. Government agencies.  NSF is one of many U.S. Government agencies conducting scientific research in the Arctic.  NSF sponsored researchers have conducted research activities in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Russia, and within Scandinavia, often in cooperation with institutions and researchers in those countries and regions.

In the Antarctic, operations will be staged primarily from McMurdo Station, Antarctica, employing a “hub-and-spoke” operational design.  Annually, approximately nine hundred flight hours over a ninety-four day exclusive use period, from early November through early February of the following year, are planned.  Flights to and from U.S. and other national program bases, field camps, and/or various research stations within Antarctica will be scheduled.  Search and rescue missions, and operations for extended periods from locations other than McMurdo Station are also required.  All labor, aircraft equipment (except for certain support equipment) and materials necessary to operate and maintain a three aircraft fleet will be contractor furnished, including full spares package, and field equipment (e.g., cargo nets, tie-down straps, tool kit, and survival kit, and other consumables).  The Government will supply berthing, meals, fuel, and certain support equipment.  

In the Arctic, flight services requirements are intermittent, and may be required at any time of the year.  Services are occasionally required in Alaska, but the most concentrated effort is support of ocean sampling sites in a broad region between the Canadian Forces Station Alert and the North Pole.  This work occurs for several weeks duration between March and May of each year and involves transportation of science teams and their equipment between sea ice field sites.  In Greenland the work occurs throughout the year but mostly between May and August, and involves ferrying field teams to and around the Greenland Ice Cap.  The contractor will provide all labor, aircraft and field equipment, materials, fuel, supplies, and consumables.  Approximately one hundred-fifty flight hours annually are anticipated.

As noted, the primary role for the aircraft in both theaters of operation will be for “utility” transportation services, ferrying personnel and materials to remote, often unprepared, field locations.  However, at least one of the aircraft will be configured with a downward-looking port, wing hard-points and in-wing cable raceways to allow the aircraft to be used for remote sensing activities to include: aerogeophysical surveys, aerial photography, LIDAR and remote digital mapping, and the operation of ice-penetrating radar systems.  An additional special requirement will be the ability to fly a towed (cable-deployed) magnetometer for aeromagnetic surveys.

This acquisition is unrestricted.  NSF anticipates publishing the RFP on May 30, 2003.  A pre-proposal conference is tentatively planned for early or mid-June.  Details will be published in the solicitation.  Proposals are due on July 3, 2003.  Contract award is expected prior to December 23, 2003, with an effective date of January 15, 2004.  A fixed price contract, with a 45-day phase-in period, and a core performance period of 36 months is contemplated, with four award term incentives of 12 months each.  The total performance period, including award term incentives, is 85.5 months.

The existing fire alarm system and generator must remain operational during the entire construction period.  The contractor is required to provide better than average collaboration of fire alarm and asbestos abatement disciplines.  The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  SELECTION PROCESS: This procurement is issued pursuant to the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.  Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a negotiated request for proposal process.  The successful offeror will be the technically acceptable firm offering the lowest request for proposal price.  The following criteria will be utilized as evaluation factors for award.

1.  Proposed Fire Alarm System shall have been available commercially for a minimum of five years.

2.  Prime contractor or subcontractor shall have demonstrated a minimum of five years successful experience incorporating the proposed Fire Alarm System.  Highlight any experience with proposed Fire Alarm System.

6. List key personnel and organizational structure.

Technical Proposals shall be evaluated on an ACCEPTABLE or NOT-ACCEPTABLE basis only.  Price is considered equally important to the Technical Evaluation Factors.  For those proposals which have been deemed technically acceptable, price will become the deciding factor upon which award will be made.  Accordingly, award will be made to the offeror whose proposal is determined to be technically acceptable and at the lowest price.  The estimated magnitude of this project is between five hundred thousand dollars and one million dollars ($500,000.00 and $1,00,000.00).  The approximate duration of the contract is 240 calendar days.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220.  This procurement is UNRESTRICTED.

Small business participation:  Although this procurement is open to large business, small, small women owned, small disadvantaged, Section 8(a), Service-disabled Veteran, and HUBZone small business firms are strongly encouraged to participate.  The Government recognizes the talent existing in smaller firms and encourages their participation in construction of Federal facilities.

<DESC>Method for Measuring Binding Constants

Abstract/Description:
Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has developed efficient methods and an apparatus for measuring and screening the binding interactions between receptors (e.g. enzymes) and ligands (e.g. small molecules).  The methods do not require exogenous tags or other chemical modifications to either the small molecule or the enzyme.  However, the methods are compatible with surface attached enzymes and small molecules.

Some status quo screening methods may require tagged ligands (e.g., in fluorescence activated cell sorting) or surface immobilization of the receptor (e.g., surface plasmon resonance).  These requirements may be ill-suited or practically impossible for some receptor/ligand pairs. In particular, tagging of many small molecules may change receptor affinity, and many protein receptors may not be currently attachable to surfaces.
  
Market Applications:
·	Pharmaceutical and drug discovery  
·	Established research market for measuring binding constants 
·	Chemical detection  
·	Pharmaceutical metabolite studies 
·	DNA or RNA binding studies

Advantages/Benefits:
·	Method provides for rapid screening of chemicals for drug and pharmaceutical applications
·	Many small molecules may be used 
·	Many enzymes and similar receptors may be used 

Intellectual Property Status:
Three U.S. patent applications are pending covering the methods and apparatus described herein.  Foreign patent protection may also be available.  This technology is available for license and may be licensed exclusively or nonexclusively, depending upon the finalization of the optimal commercialization strategy.  Cooperative research and development opportunities may also be available.

Reference Numbers:
S-100,585
S-100,502
S-99,911
S-94,661

Companies with an interest in licensing the LANL technology referenced above or that are interested in entering into a collaborative arrangement with LANL to further develop this technology for future commercialization must submit a written letter of intent to the contact listed above.  The letter of intent must address the following important areas:  (1) provide a description of the company, including its business goals; (2) demonstrate experience with developing and marketing similar technology; (3) specify the company’s motivation for participating in the commercialization of the technology described above and identify how commercialization of this technology fits with the company’s current product offering and business focus; and (4) briefly describe the human and financial resources available (e.g., annual report) to support the commercialization of this technology.  The letter of intent must be postmarked by September 2, 2003.

LANL will provide additional information to each respondent that submits a letter of interest that meets the above criteria.  Such correspondence will be distributed to eligible respondents within 2-3 weeks following receipt of letters of intent.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services (HRSA) intends to negotiate under FAR Part 13 - SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS PROCEDURES on a sole source basis with The Monroe County Long Term Care Program (MCLTCP), 349 West Commercial Street, Suite 2250, East Rochester, NY  14445. The NAICS Code is 541618.   This acquisition is to conduct an analysis of the data from the demonstration of chronic disease health promotion nurse model to determine if positive outcomes are maintained over time for rural elderly.  The demonstration is "A Randomized Controlled Trial of Primary and Consumer Directed Care for People with Chronic Illnesses," CMS No. 95-C-90467/2-01.   MCLTCP shall provide the following:  (1) conduct a quantitative analysis to assess changes in patients outcome of rural underserved patients, (2) conduct a mortality analysis to insure that the positive ADL results not achieved at the expense of longevity and (3) determine what factors can enhance the health promotion nurse model in rural areas, particularly in the area of patient functional by utilizing a case study approach to combine quantitative data from the clinical record wit interview data obtained by re-interviewing patients, information caregivers, and project staff.  MCLTCP is sole source organization with exclusive rights to the demonstration database provided to CMS and maintains the only demonstration of models for chronic diseases self-managed on medicare beneficiaries in the entire country.
MCLTCP is the only organization that conducts these rural analyses for HRSA's Office of Rural Health Policy (ORHP) because this organization maintains a unique qualification for the rural analysis that is needed for this requirement and is the only organization that has analyzed the data for all geographic areas, both urban and rural.   Any other organization that attempts to development this type of database would have to replicate their previous accomplishments and develop the infrastructure of a date system before beginning the collection of data to ascertain the extent of drug coverage.  This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition.  Therefore, MCLTCL is a responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S.C. 253 (c), (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.

This is not a solicitation and published for information purposes only.  A copy of the Justification For Other Than Full and Open Competition is on file.  Written inquiries must reference Requisition Number 03-OA-076.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate under FAR Part 13 – SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS PROCEDURES on sole source basis with the EMMES Corporation, 401 North Washington, Suite 700, and Rockville, MD  20850. The NAICS Code is 541618.  This acquisition is to address the extent of health insurance coverage for immunosuppressive therapy among private health insurers in a larger scale with approximately 400 participants in the study.  EMMES shall submit a proposal using the survey tool already developed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget.  Once the results of the pilot study have been submitted to OMB, EMMES shall performed the following tasks:  (1) obtain institutional review board (IRB) approval of all p0articipants transplant centers (2) identify the individuals at the pediatric transplants centers to complete the survey (3) submit and collect the survey from these individuals (4) appropriately reimburse the individuals who completed the survey (5) analyze and (6) submit a report to on the results of the data collection and analysis.  EMMES has established the database and transplant center networking to be uniquely qualified.  EMMES Corporation is a small business that provides statistical, data management and organizationally support to clinics and biomedical scientist in the NAPRTCS and the SPLIT.  The NAPRTCS data base collects data on approximately 85% of the 6000-7000 post transplant pediatric kidney patients and the SPLIT data base collects data on approximately 75% of the 1000 post-transplant pediatric liver patients and has information as to whether the patient has private health insurance or public health insurance.  EMMES is the only contractor able to coordinate the efforts and all of these pediatric transplant programs and guarantee participation of the centers.   Any other organization that attempts to development this type of database would have to replicate their previous accomplishments and develop the infrastructure of a date system before beginning the collection of data to ascertain the extent of drug coverage.  This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition.  Therefore, EMMES Corporation is a responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S.C. 253 (c), (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute(NCI), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB), plans to enter into a sole source contract with Kline & Co., Inc., 150 Clove Road, Little Falls, NH 07424 to provide consulting services to create a database for identifying pesticide active ingredients that were on the market in the years 1976 and 2000 for treatement of residential pests, and to assign a probability that each active ingredient was used to treat a specific type of pest (e.g., crawling insects, lawn weeds, etc.).  Kline & Co., Inc., previously estimated these probabilites for the years 1980 and 1990 and assigned a conficence level to each probability estimate.  Based on a review of this work, NCI has decided to calculate the probabilities and confidence levels for two additioanl years:  1976 and 2000.  Although such information is available in the literature for agriculture presticides, an exhaustive literature search revealed virtually no quantitative historic information on pesticide use in residential settings.  The Federal agency responsible for regulating pesticides used in homes and gardens is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  EPA routinely uses data from market research firms when analyzing the economic impacts of regulations that EPA promulgates restricting pesticides.  Kline & Co. is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the necessary historic market research data on residential pesticides.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the aboe requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilites.  THe capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EDT, (local Washington, D.C. time) on July 29, 2003.  If you have any questions please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code is 541690.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, a firm fixed price award to Clinical Tools, Inc., 431 W. Franklin Street, #24, Chapel Hill, NC  27516.  The purpose of this request includes 12 months maintenance of CarePlanner.Espansol  and support for three (3) pilots.  CarePlanner.Espanol is the Spanish version of CarePlanner.  The CarePlanners are person-centered; interactive, Internet-based long-term care decision-support and education tools.  The pilots are designed to provide additional usability testing of CarePlanner.Espanol in service environments, i.e., home and community-based waiver programs (HCBS) and a clinical setting.  These tools help identify, analyze and manage protections and risks for seniors and disabled individuals in community settings.  They weigh risks of each individual to identify those risks that are most likely to affect the health and safety of the individual.  Unlike other risk assessment tools that look at one factor, the CarePlanner assessment considers multiple factors-health, treatment, daily living challenges, and caregiver supports.  The risk-assessment feature can be used to systematically monitor protections and risks of beneficiaries on an ongoing basis.  Clinical Tools, Inc. developed the English and Spanish versions of CarePlanner and is the only vendor with the proprietary knowledge of these tools.  CarePlanner. Clinical Tools also maintains both tools on its Internet platform.  From inception, our business plan called for adding additional functionality and developing models for additional populations.  In this stage of the development we are adding and testing the report functionality and integration into service environments and further testing the usability with Hispanic individuals, families and for providers who serve these populations.  The Contractor has successfully designed and implemented a tool that is easy to navigate and contains information at 4th to 9th grade reading level so that individuals with low literacy can understand.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, a firm fixed price award to Howard University, School of Social Work and the Hispanic Multicultural Affairs Program, 601 Howard Place, NW, Washington, DC.  This workshop is a partnership between the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and Howard University, School of Social Work and the Office of Hispanic and Multicultural Affairs Program.  The purpose of this project is to increase the capacity of Hispanic faculty and health professionals conducting health services research.  The objectives of the project are to: 1) select and train 27 Hispanic researchers and health professionals on how to write health services research grants, 2) increase the number of Hispanic researchers applying for health services research grants, 3) increase the success rate of participants who apply for a health services grant award), 4) increase the number of health services research grants on Hispanic health services topics, 5) increase the number of well trained competitive Hispanic researchers, 6) examine successful grants that have been written to learn more about the mechanics of writing a fundable grant proposal, 7) enhance the capacity of Hispanic researchers to work with CMS, and 8) provide Hispanic health professionals with the tools and skills needed to prepare and submit competitive research grants.  The Howard University Hospital is directly linked to the Hispanic community, through its Office of Hispanic and Multicultural Affairs program.  The Howard University Office of the Medical Director is the sponsor of the Hispanic and Multicultural Affairs program.  It was created in 1994 with the purpose to promote education, prevention, and health services as well as to facilitate the access to the health care system for the Hispanic and non-English speaking population in the greater Washington area.  The mission is to provide the highest quality of standard of excellence in health care delivery to non-English speaking people in a friendly and personal manner to cultural and linguistically diverse communities.  The mission also includes helping to prepare Howard University Hospital employees to provide the highest quality of health services and maximum patient satisfaction for multicultural and multiracial groups.  This Office offers a variety of services in response to health needs of non-English speaking populations.  These services include general information regarding the services that the Hospital provides, education in preventive medicine, assistance in clinical appointments for patients, assistance in referring patients to hospital services and community clinics according to the patients needs, counseling and translation services in Spanish.  The Hispanic and Multicultural Office also offer an outreach program for the Hispanic community in promoting preventive health services.  The Office therefore provides an important link to the Hispanic community.  This exemplifies Howard University commitment to the health education and pursuance of healthy people year 2005 objectives.  A major factor for the sole source justification is that this institution is addressing a health area that CMS is concern about.  For example, Howard University focused its attention to African American and Hispanic health issues, i.e., understanding health disparities, health status, health outcomes, barriers to care, and access to care.  Howard University is uniquely placed to improve the health status of African American and Hispanic American communities because of the respect and trust accorded to it by the community.  Its research and training programs involve significant number of Blacks and Hispanics.  The University infrastructure and resources puts it in a unique position to nurture the growth of young minority scientists and collaborate with larger institutions, small Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and form partnerships with the community.  Howard University has the expertise in planning, designing, development, and implementation of programs focusing on assessing barriers to care and differences in health status of minority populations, and improving health outcomes for minority populations.  This institution has the necessary experience and unique capability to put on this type of workshop.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is conducting a national building and fire safety investigation of the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster.  More information about NIST's investigation may be found at the NIST Web site http://wtc.nist.gov.  This solicitation will contribute to completion of the objectives of Project 6, Structural Fire Response and Collapse.  Specific information for Project 6, may be found by following this link to the NIST Web site http://wtc.nist.gov/media/WTCplan_new.htm#proj6.

The objective of this solicitation is to:  Determine the probable structural collapse initiation sequences for each WTC tower through analysis of the structural response of each building, both with and without impact damage, to structural temperatures from internal fires.  The tasks include analysis of:  (a) floor and column components and subsystems for service loads and time-temperature histories for ASTM standard test fires and representative building fire conditions, (b) the effect of the largest possible fire(s) in a tower without impact damage on the global stability of the structure, and (c) the contribution of probable fire paths in each tower with impact damage on the global stability of the structure. The analyses shall include the effect of elevated temperatures, component and/or subsystem failures, and the resulting load redistribution in the structure up to the point of global instability.  The structural models and sequences of collapse initiation must be consistent with the video and photographic records, and other documented observations of the event.

Details of this requirement will be provided in the solicitation.  The requirement will be for a period of eight (8) months.  Award of a commercial Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), contract is anticipated with Firm Fixed Price Task Orders to be issued.  FAR Part 13.5 "Test Program for Certain Commercial Items" will apply to this requirement.  It is anticipated that a single solicitation will be issued on or about July 28, 2003 at www.fedbizopps.gov.  The solicitation, all amendments and any questions and answers to the solicitation will be posted to FEDBIZOPPS and are totally the responsibility of the Offeror.  No mailing lists will be kept and no hard copy of the RFQ will be available.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to enter into a sole source procurement with the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) to provide services to convene a series of workshops, task groups, and consultations for this requirement.  This requirement addresses primarily actions directed towards facilitating the implementation and maximizing the impact of proposed changes to building- and construction-related practices, guidelines, standards and codes to come out of the WTC investigation and the Research and Development Program.  This sole source procurement with NIBS is justified based on their unique capabilities and proven track record in facilitating successful technological and regulatory issues.  NIBS is a non-profit, non-governmental organization authorized by the U.S. Congress in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 and is uniquely qualified to provide the facilitation required to bring all sectors together in workshops or task groups for the exchange of information and views in identifying mutual issues. 

The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price (FFP), indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for a base year and four (4) one-year options to begin on or about August 20, 2003.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-5.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) package is not available.

<DESC>INTEGRATED MAINTENANCE DATA SYSTEM (IMDS) This is an announcement = of a Request for Information (RFI). The Government does not presently intend to award a contract but = requests the following information for planning purposes.  The IMDS Systems = Program Office (SPO) is doing market research to gain knowledge of the capabilities of commercial maintenance products (or product suites) = that have the potential for providing Wing and Depot level maintenance information automation requirements for the Air Force.  Information on products that have the capability for horizontal logistics integration, = to include supply functionality, may be submitted.  Background information = on IMDS and Air Force Maintenance is available through the Hanscom = Electronic Request for Proposal Bulletin Board (HERBB) web site http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil/. (Note: Select "Systems" within = "Business Opportunities" and then scroll to "Integrated Maintenance Data System"). The products must have a viable commercial presence in the aviation marketplace and should be in current use in applications similar to the Air Force use.  To determine the extent the current commercial products can be adapted to the USAF maintenance environment, the IMDS SPO will perform an analysis of the real-world use of the actual applications = and how the firms' products support maintenance.  The SPO would like to conduct on-site visits to using activities to view the ability to = perform selected Wing and Depot level functional scenarios and capabilities as they are being performed by application users. =B7	Examples of Depot level scenarios are: o	Life Cycle of a Workload (forecasted to paperwork and analysis completion) o	Depot Maintenance Repair Overhaul (MRO) Capability o	Production capacity evaluation o	Depot workload forecasting o	Workload routing o	Reports =B7	Examples of Wing level scenarios are: o	Equipment Configuration Management o	Equipment Utilization/Performance o	Unscheduled and Scheduled Maintenance Support o	Status/Inventory The analysis will also look at functionality related areas to include: o	Product customization features o	Standardized reporting and ad hoc reporting capabilities o	Sourcing personnel/personnel qualification information from various human resources systems o	Support for data entry/reporting across multiple time zones o	Usability The products must have been developed and documented in a manner such = that they are able to meet Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for Command, Control, Communications and Computers Integrated Support Plan (C4ISP) to include architecture and security.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The only mention of gradients is for the diffusion probe with 1,000G/cm capabilities. Was it your intention to acquire hi res probes without gradients or was this an unintentional omission?  Answer:  It was an unintentional omission.  However, we are requiring the ability to upgrade to gradients with 1,000G/cm capabilities to look at diffusion in solid samples.

SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS:
Government Property Furnished For Repair:  Failure of the Government to furnish such items in the amounts or quantities described in the Schedule of Supplies/Services as “estimated” or “maximum” will not entitle the contractor to any equitable adjustment in price under the Government Property clause of the contract.  The Government reserves the right to do depot level repair of the components described in the Schedule of Supplies/Services.

Upon agreement of an incremental charge and issuance of a contract modification to reflect this change, the service bulletin shall be incorporated into each subsequent component received at the repair facility if said service bulletin has not already been incorporated.  When service bulletin incorporation changes the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) part number, the new part number shall be added to the contract.  The same procedures apply if removal of service bulletins is required.

Exclusions - Components received, which indicate obvious misuse, cannibalization, or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage may dictate an exclusion from the prices specified in the schedule.

<DESC>UPDATE (21 Jul 03): The site visit date of 24 Jul 2003 will be rescheduled for a later date.  A formal amendment will be posted ASAP.  The deadline to respond  to the site visit will be adjusted as well. Project Number 960703: Repair Fire Safety/AC, Facility 10834 (Base) Project Number 960704: Repair Fire Safety/AC, Facility 10835 (Option I) Project Number 960705: Repair Fire Safety/AC, Facility 10836 (Option II) Solicitation Number F33601-03-R-0050. The scope of this project consists of furnishing all materials and performing  all labor required to complete the replacement of the fan coil units,  heating/cooling water system, windows, and roof in Facilities 10834, 10835, and  10836.  The scope will also include associated architectural, mechanical,  plumbing, electrical, and miscellaneous work as shown on the project drawings  and described in the specifications.  The estimated price range is  between $1M and $5M.  The NAICS Code is 238220.  The size standard is $12M.   This is an UNRESTRICTED procurement in accordance with the Small Business  Competitiveness Demonstration Program Act of 1988, Public Law 100-656 (15  U.S.C. 644 note). In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, contractors must be registered in the  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of solicitations issued  after 31 May 1998.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov, or  telephone at 1-888-CCR-2423.  Every solicitation issued after 31 May 1998 must  include the clause at DFARS 252.204-7004, "Required Central Contractor  Registration.: SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: This project involves  the Visitor Quarters (VQ), which houses military and  civilian personnel of all levels, including VIPs on  Temporary Duty at WPAFB for numerous official Air Force  activities.  This project is in an extremely high  visibility area, due to the number of visiting individuals  housed at any one time, and will receive an unusually high  level of scrutiny.  This project will be subject to a very  tight construction schedule.  The project is in phases, and  involves work in each room.  This work will require close  coordination between disciplines, and close supervision by  the contractor in order to minimize the number of  unavailable rooms at any one time.  The work must be  accomplished so that the remaining occupied units will not  be impacted, nor the personnel housed in them  inconvenienced.  The requirement to supervise and  coordinate the work in all of the rooms contained in the  VQ will present the contractor with a difficult  construction management challenge.  Failure to supervise  and coordinate the different trades required to provide a  quality and timely product will not be acceptable.   Performance is critical to minimize disruption to WPAFB  activities.  The liquidated damages associated with not  meeting the contractual period of performance will be high  due to the cost of housing Air Force personnel off base if  the rooms are not available on schedule. NOTES: (1) The solicitation, specifications, and drawings will be available on the  website on or about 14 July 03, at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil. (2) Hard copies of the solicitation will NOT be provided.  However, you may  download and print the file from the website. (3) There is no fee for this solicitation. (4) A hard copy of the solicitation will be available for review at Dayton  Builders Exchange, Minority Contractor Business Assistance Program, and F.W.  Dodge Division in Dayton, OH. (5) A registration page will be attached to the website.  You are not required  to register.  Howeverm when you register you will receive notice of any  amendments and/or addendums that may be issued to the solicitation.  If you  have not registered, it will be your responsibility to check the website for  any changes to the solicitation. (6) Contractors shall be capable of securing bonding for the total proposed  amount (base plus options).  However, contractors shall only be responsible for  providing bonding for the base amount plus the amount of any/all options  exercised at the time of award.  If an option is exercised after award,  contractors shall be responsible for securing the additional bonding equal to  the amount of the option. (7) You shall provide a signed copy of the SF 1442 by the proposal closing date  specified in the solicitation.  There will not be a public bid opening. (8) Contractors that are Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment are  excluded from receiving contracts.  Agencies also shall not consent to  subcontract with such contractors.  Proposals prepared by Debarred, Suspended,  or otherwise ineligible contractors are at the risk and expense of the  contractor.

<DESC>USDA, ARS, SAA intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, MJ Research, Inc. Las Vegas, NV, to provide 5 DNA thermal cyclers. Three of the thermal cyclers must possess the following characteristics: We require DNA thermal cyclers for laboratory analyses of the polymerase chain reaction.  For optimum, high-throughput of DNA samples, we require 6 cyclers, configured into 3 pairs.  The cyclers must have interchangeable sample blocks, designed to carry both 96-well and 384-well plates.  The thermal cyclers must employ technology to allow for optimization of incubation temperatures within a single experiment. The thermal cyclers must employ technology to have uniform temperature between wells on a plate. Each of the 3 double-bay thermal cyclers must have graphical programming with point-and-click navigation via a touch pad or mouse.  Each cycler must accommodate multiple sample blocks that are interchangeable; two of the pairs (4 cyclers) should come with 96-well sample blocks and the third pair (2 cyclers) should come with 384-well sample blocks.  All cyclers must have software that will allow optimization reactions of temperature within a single experiment.  The software must be programmable to set-up a temperature gradient differential of between 1-240C across a 96-well plate.  The low and high programmable temperatures should range from 300C to 1050C.  Thermal accuracy of the sample blocks must be within + 0.30C of NIST standard at 900C.  The thermal range should be from –50C to 1050C, with a thermal ramping rate of up to 3.00C/sec.  The lids must be heated and be manually adjustable for height and pressure.  The heat pumps must be designed for repeated cycling within the thermal range.  Cyclers must have sufficient memory to store up to 300 programs.  Cyclers should have protection from power failures. We require one thermal cycler with four 96 well V-bottom plates or 384 0.2 ml tubes, temperature range –5 to 105 degrees C, ramp rate 3.0 degrees C/sec, number of programs 400 or more, must come with heated lid, must have gradient capability, must come with networking capability, must come with power failure restart.  The fifth thermal cycler required is a refurbished RTC-0220 which includes a two year parts/labor warranty. This procurement will be made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(2)(C)(ii).   No telephone inquiries will be accepted. Interested parties should submit written responses including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office within 15 calendar days after publication of this notice.  It should be noted that no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to re-release the announcement in order to (1) better define the AFRL/SBR JPO relationship, (2) provide a more detailed definition of the technology, and (3) update the FY04 white paper date from 30Jun03 to 30Sep03.  AFRL Program Manager: Brian O'Hern, email ohern@rl.af.mil, 315/330-3995; Alternate: Jon S. Jones, e-mail Jon.Jones@rl.af.mil 315/330-1665; Technical Points of Contact: Steve Scott, email steve.scott@rl.af.mil, 315/330-4414; Contracting Officer: Renee F. Arcuri, email Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil; 315-330-4777.  The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division (AFRL/IFE) in cooperation with the Space Based Radar Joint Program Office (SBR JPO) is seeking innovative solutions for the reduction of risk associated with the development, deployment, and operation of the Battle Management Command Control and Communications (BMC3) segment of a Space-Based Radar (SBR) system. This effort is intended to directly support the activities of the Space-Based Radar program and compliment its ongoing system definition and risk reduction activities.  Several significant efforts are currently underway.  These include the  System Concept Analysis task order executed via the Engineering, Analysis, Design and Development (EADDII) contract (awarded in December 2002) the ongoing SBR On-Board-Processor (OBP) and the Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) contracted activities that are planned to continue through 2003.  Results of this effort may influence the design of the SBR Concept of Operations, OBP design, ESA design, and system design.  Additionally, it is expected that significant insight to total system architecture and its performance will be gained through this activity by enhancing understanding of issues associated with reducing risk for as well as developing SBR BMC3 solutions.  Due to the long lead-time to develop OBP and ESA, the SBR JPO is particularly interested in BMC3 design trade implications impacting these areas.  This SBR System will consist of a satellite constellation with a multi-mode radar producing Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and High Resolution Terrain Information (HRTI) products.  This SBR BMC3 Risk Reduction BAA will focus on the following technology areas: 1) Collection Management including dynamic tasking from CONUS and theater,  2) Information Management, and  3) Combat Operations Products including GMTI, SAR imagery, Combat Identification, and multi-intelligence products taking into consideration tasking, cueing and fusion with other sensor modalities such as SIGINT and air sensors.  In the area of Collection Management, developments allowing the dynamic retasking of a satellite sensor from theatre in a timely, assured, secure, and robust manner are required. This area will explore different conceptual architectures, and their associated technologies to satisfy national and tactical users needs for satellite sensor retasking and timely notification of status. Tasking functions must also provide the capability task data archives to retrieve the appropriate data to do machine-level change detection in support of theater situational awareness.  Objectives include defining the technical requirements for mission management and defining notional mission management architectures. This includes a study of available applications for satellite retasking, SBR resource allocation techniques, and available applications suitable for use in satellite retasking, such as track waveform scheduling, track loss/stop verification, track restart with continuity of identification, interrupted imaging modes, etc. Offerors must consider satellite orbits, including orientations that provide repeated views from the same look angle to provide additional SAR change detection capability, handoffs, gap times, coverage areas, revisit times, resolution, sensor modes available, task prioritization, etc. and notification of reprioritized task list to all potential interested users. In addition, other advanced modes such as passive ESM, X-band communications, and low power ocean surveillance modes should be considered.    Offerors must consider event detection, activity level measurements, correlated movement of units, and ship tracking in their proposals.  Ground processing must consider machine bulk filtering of data, SAR change detection and GMTI level of activity monitoring.  In the area of Information Management (IM), support of BMC3 for SBR will be a critical factor for determining tactical Tasking, Posting, Processing, and Using (TPPU) alternatives, national Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) alternatives, and CONOPS alternatives system design tradeoffs. This area will characterize IM technologies in terms of SBR BMC3 risk areas and summarize SBR requirements drivers for IM. In particular, after performing ground processing, the SBR system of systems must archive (post), catalog, and facilitate rapid database query, and dissemination of information to the user community. Development of an integrated and interoperable architecture for theater and national information management is the goal. This includes an assessment of technical requirements for this architecture, identification of technical deficiencies in data warehousing and data mining, and prototyping an implementation of national and tactical information management architectures and activities such as autonomous meta-data capture mechanisms, characterization of intelligent agents to process meta-data, and peer-to-peer mechanisms for information exchange. Some consideration should be given to appropriate meta-data descriptors, such as pedigree, and data-derived products.  The area of Combat Operations Products has been identified as high risk and requires additional technical development. Current GMTI, SAR exploitation techniques are manual, operator intensive, based on single or multiple airborne sensor concepts, and very limited. In addition, utilizing a satellite constellation with rapidly changing viewing angles and varying sensor performance attributes has not been fully explored, and therefore, requires development, testing, and analysis. Furthermore, software must combine the data from these satellite sensors into meaningful products. This area will develop the necessary extensions to current ground tracking algorithms to support the expected characteristics of a space-based radar constellation. Items of interest include extensions to existing capabilities and development of new feature-based classification approaches for SBR to support classification and track maintenance. Particular attention will be focused on developing algorithms and analyses for the use of selected feature data such as High Range Resolution (HRR), Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR), and Micro-Doppler techniques to perform long-term track maintenance. These tools must be integrated with the synoptic machine-level processes described previously.  Efforts under this BAA will provide prototype algorithms to enable the fusion of resources for the timely detection, track, and identification of ground moving targets. These efforts will also leverage existing developments in the operational area such as Moving Target Information Exploitation (MTIX) and develop on those architectures making it easily adaptable to existing architectures for technology transition.  SBR Measures of Performance (MOPs) and Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) need to be developed and integrated into these new concepts. This will provide the methodology for consistent system evaluation.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a one-sided, 12 point type, single spaced, one inch margined white paper not to exceed ten (10) pages with a cover letter. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to AFRL/IFEA, ATTN: Brian O'Hern, (Reference BAA 03-04-IFKA), 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY, 13441-4414.

<DESC>Amendment 2 has been issued for this statement of interest which  replaces the NAICS code.  The new NAICS code for this is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services (500 employees).

CH2M HILL Hanford Group, Inc. (CH2M HILL) in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Tank Farm Contract, is soliciting interest and information from qualified firms having the capability of performing analytical services (laboratory management; inorganic, organic and radiochemical analyses; methods development and process troubleshooting) for the analysis of radioactive and/or hazardous waste samples.  The DOE has announced the pending transfer of the 222-S Laboratory to CH2M HILL, the primary user of the Laboratory’s analytical services.  In addition to supporting CH2M HILL, the Laboratory provides site-wide analytical services for the Hanford site.  CH2M HILL is interested in contracting with a nationally recognized laboratory organization to gain commercial efficiencies in operations. 

This will be a local business preference solicitation. To be considered local, interested parties must be operating in the local vicinity of the Hanford site for the duration of any resulting contract.  For interested parties not presently operating within the local vicinity, but plan to respond to the proposed solicitation, sufficient details showing such planning so as to be fully operational at the time of contract award (September 2003) shall be required to be submitted with their proposal.   

Further it is the intent of CH2M HILL to provide the maximum practical opportunity for small businesses to participate in contract performance.  Therefore, small businesses, small women-owned businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and small service-disabled businesses are encouraged to apply and/or participate in teaming agreements to participate in contract performance.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for determining size status is 541380.     

Interested parties are hereby requested to review and provide comments on the information provided herein.  Closing date for this RFI is May 14, 2003. An informational session on the existing analytical services will be conducted on April 24, 2003.  Tour schedules of the facility will be announced at the meeting. Participants will be advised where to meet for the tour.  The tour will be restricted to two individuals for each firm who will participate.  A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is anticipated to be released on or about June 18, 2003.  There will be a second tour conducted after the draft RFP has been issued for those parties who wish to attend.


CH2M HILL is requesting interest and information on 3 options for analytical services:
1.	Management and direction of the 222-S Analytical Laboratory on the Hanford site that is being transferred to CH2M HILL, as a member of the CH2M HILL team.
2.	Becoming an approved subcontractor to CH2M HILL in charge of the analytical services scope performing the analyses for CH2M HILL including absorbing the current equipment and staff (augmented as appropriate) into the subcontract organization to complete the necessary scope.
3.	Performing some or all of the analytical services scope at offsite operations 

The successful Contractor shall be required to accept the Labor Agreement in place with the Hanford Atomic Metal Trade Council (HAMTC-AFL-CIO) at the time of contract award. The terms of this Labor Agreement will be applicable to these employees until the Contractor executes a new labor contract with HAMTC.  The successful Contractor will be required to offer employment to transferring HAMTC represented personnel.  These bargaining unit employees will become employees of the Contractor as of the effective date of the Contract for Options 2 and 3.  Any grievances/arbitrations occurring after the start of this work shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.  The number of personnel, craft specialties, wage rates, etc. will be made available in the draft RFP.

The successful Contractor will be expected to consider offering positions to the existing exempt and non-exempt staff.  The number of exempt and non-exempt personnel and their specialties will be made available in the draft RFP.

The existing equipment and instrumentation located in the 222-S Laboratory will be made available to the Contractor for Options 1 and 2, provided it is deemed suitable for release under Government and CH2M HILL procedures.  Equipment and instrumentation that can be made available and is deemed suitable for use by the Contractor will be made available for use at no additional cost to the Contractor. 

The successful Contractor shall be required to give priority to CH2M HILL’s and other Hanford site contractors’ analytical services requirements. The total annual volume of analytical services work is estimated to be $30M with currently around 25,000 analyses consisting of 20% organic analyses (PCB, VOA, SVOA), 30% radiochemistry and 50% inorganic analyses (primarily metals). Additional analytical service needs and equipment in support of the Office of River Protection Project may become a part of the final Request for Proposal. 

The successful Contractor must comply with the following codes, standards and other requirements as specified within task orders as well as applicable Federal, State and local laws, licensing and regulations: 

·	A Quality Assurance Program based on voluntary national consensus standards such as the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (NELAP), NQA-1 etc. and meeting the requirements of Code of Federal Regulations 10 CFR 830, Nuclear Safety Management, Subpart A, Quality Assurance and the Hanford site’s analytical quality requirements document, HASQARD.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC is solicitating responses for Market Research purposes for the Constellation-X Mission.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by NASA to enter into a contract. Constellation-X is a NASA Mission to perform X-ray spectroscopy with a space-borne sensor array. The Constellation-X Project Office at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is soliciting information from industry to support planning for a Spectroscopy X-ray Telescope (SXT) Flight Mirror Assembly (FMA) contract.  A phased procurement is planned with the initial award in May of 2004. The objective of the Constellation-X mission is to observe X-rays from Galactic and extra-galactic sources to accomplish the following science objectives: 1) Measure the effects of strong gravity near the event horizon of supermassive black holes; 2) Trace visible matter throughout the universe and constrain the nature of dark matter and dark energy; 3) Study the formation of supermassive black holes and trace their evolution with cosmic time; 4) Study the life cycles of matter and energy and understand the behavior of matter in extreme environments. The Constellation-X flight segment consists of a constellation of four identical observatories in orbit at the L2 Sun-Earth Libration point. All four observatories simultaneously observe the same target and the data are combined on the ground. Each observatory has two types of telescope systems: the SXT which covers the 0.25 to 10 keV bandpass and the Hard X-ray Telescope (HXT) which covers from 6.0 to 40 keV. Each SXT has a Flight Mirror Assembly (FMA) shared by two detector systems: an X-ray Microcalorimeter Spectrometer (XMS) and a Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) Focal-Plane Camera (RFC). The reference SXT FMA consists of four major components: the SXT mirror, the RGS Grating Array (RGA), pre- and post- collimators and mounting structure as required to attach and maintain alignment of these sub-assemblies. The mirror consists of highly nested reflectors utilizing a two-reflection Wolter Type I design, in which the incident X-rays reflect off confocal paraboloid and hyperboloid surfaces of revolution at shallow angles.  A fraction of the reflected rays focus on the XMS detector and a fraction of the X-rays reflect off the RGA and are dispersed onto the RFC detector. Subject to formal approval, the project starts development (Phase C/D) in the year 2009 with a first launch in 2013.  The Constellation-X web site http://constellation.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/main.html describes the science objectives of the mission; the proposed mission itself, the SXT FMA, spacecraft and instruments; and some of the technology challenges that must be met.  As a result of this Request for Information (RFI), NASA anticipates entering into a Partnering Phase activity with potential offerors who are determined to be viable competitors for the SXT FMA contract. (A separate, similar acquisition for the mission prime contractor is planned to commence at a later date.) The SXT FMA acquisition schedule is as follows: July 2003 – January 2004 Partnering Phase: Viable competitors will be given the opportunity to meet with NASA, both in groups and in one-on-one sessions.  During this phase there will be exchanges of information that will enable potential offerors to prepare for the subsequent acquisition, and to make recommendations to NASA concerning its requirements and its acquisition approach. May 2004 – November 2004 Study Phase: Two contractors will provide parallel design and analyses in support of the Constellation-X SXT FMA definition and will prepare a plan to complete a mirror prototype and provide the SXT FMA. This phase will result from a Request for Proposals (RFP) to be issued in January 2004, with contract award in May 2004.  NASA anticipates awarding two parallel Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contracts, each worth ~$1 M. August 2005 – SXT Prototype and FMA Development – Execution Phase: A single Contractor will be selected to develop the SXT mirror prototype and provide the four FMA’s for the flight observatories.  The planned release date for the RFP is January 2005 with contract award August 2005.  NASA anticipates a Cost-Reimbursable contract with Award and Incentive features.  NASA is currently developing new technology required for the SXT mirrors including reflector fabrication, mounting, alignment and metrology. Descriptions of these technologies are available at https://conxproj.gsfc.nasa.gov/business/business.htm and in various publications (e.g., SPIE). It is envisioned that some or all of the technology will be transferred to the FMA Study contractors, with complete transfer to the FMA contractor team. Technology transfer for the Study Phase will consist of technical interchange meetings, designs, procedures, demonstrations, etc.  The scope of work of the FMA Study contract is expected to be as described in the following paragraph.  However, this scope is very preliminary at this time.  NASA anticipates that during the Partnering Phase, it will solicit input and recommendations that will be considered in determining the scope of work for the subsequent Request for Proposal. Scope of Work for SXT FMA Study Contractor  The SXT FMA Study contractor will perform tasks, which may include: § Design definition and trade studies §   Error budgets and requirements flow down §	  Manufacturing and assembly flow concepts §	Prototype and technology transfer planning §    System verification and validation planning §   Metrology requirements identification and implementation	  planning §    Interface definition  § Risk identification, assessment and mitigation  §	 Cost and schedules estimates	Presolicitation This RFI is a solicitation for information and planning purposes.  NASA has posted certain information at a Constellation-X business web site https://conxproj.gsfc.nasa.gov/business/business.htm to enable potential offerors to learn more about the Constellation-X SXT FMA, and to enable them to respond to this RFI.  The information contained on this web site is useful for developing an understanding of the Constellation-X program.	Of particular importance is the Constellation TRIP report, which contains within it discussions of the SXT FMA requirements, design concepts, technology descriptions and development plans. The objectives of this RFI are the following: to invite potential offerors to submit information that allows NASA to advise them about their potential to be viable competitors; to promote competition; to improve potential offerors’ understanding of the requirements; and to improve the NASA’s knowledge of industry’s capabilities. This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled “Solicitation for Information or Planning Purposes.”  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by NASA to enter into a contract.  This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time. This notice constitutes all information concerning the Constellation-X SXT FMA procurement that will be furnished at this time.  Firms interested in obtaining other information must submit a request, in writing, to Jerry Edmond, Code 210.6, NASA/GSFC, Greenbelt, Maryland 20771. Please do not request other information until you have read the documentation available through the web site described above. Offerors who intend to respond with a capabilities statement are requested to notify Jean Grady at Jean.F.Grady@nasa.gov within seven calendar days of receiving this notice.  Interested firms are requested to submit their capability statements, as well as any comments and suggestions on the acquisition approach to the address cited above.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS, Division of Prevention, Traumatic Stress and Special Programs (DPTSSP) is seeking capability statements from organizations to examine technical assistance strategies to help families across the Nation learn that evidenced-based mental health preventive services and programs have been developed for infants, toddlers, pre-school, school-aged children and adolescent and could potentially be used in their communities. It is essential for families to be aware of the empirically tested strategies that have delayed or prevented the onset of some mental health disorders experience by children and youth. This simplified acquisition will enhance the capacity of family run organizations to conduct outreach and education for families with young children, about resilience, mental health promotion, and the prevention of mental and behavioral disorders.  In order to accomplish this purpose, CMHS intends to provide resources for the Federation for Families for Children’s Mental Health (hereafter, The Federation) to conduct a learning academy for a select national work group composed of CMHS/SAMHSA staff and representatives of the Federation for Children’s Mental Health members to discuss and review promising practices and literature promoting resilience, mental health, and prevention.  The framework for this learning academy would involve working with three or more preventionists, e.g., Greenberg, Webster-Stratton and Beardslee.  As a result of this learning academy, the Federation will adapt currently available materials for families with young children.  The materials and dissemination method will be reviewed by family members in order to refine the materials and propose delivery methods appropriate for families concerned with the prevention of mental and behavioral disorders.  The Contractor shall share what is available on SAMHSA’s National Registry of Effective Prevention Practices (NREP) to the more than 150 Family Organizations concerned about children’s mental health.  

This project supports SAMHSA’s Science to Service Initiative in the SAMHSA Priority Area:  Prevention & Early Intervention.  It embodies SAMHSA’s Cross-Cutting Principle of collaboration with public and private partners.  It offers an excellent opportunity to provide family members who already have a child diagnosed with serious emotional disturbance the information needed to prevent mental and behavioral problems in other children.  

The goal of this project is to enhance the capacity of the 150 family run organizations engaged with The Federation to conduct outreach and education for families with young children, school-aged children, and adolescents about resilience, the prevention of mental and behavioral disorders and the promotion of mental health.  

The performance of this simplified acquisition necessitates the following: (1)participate in a learning academy with experts in the area of preventing mental and behavioral disorders in children and adolescents; (2) adapt materials already developed and disseminated by SAMHSA on “ How to Promote Resilience and Mental Health in Children” and with guidance from the Government Project Officer utilize information found in two literature reviews commissioned by SAMHSA/CMHS about preventive interventions for children and adolescents.  The materials may be repackaged by the Contractor; (3) keep current about and utilize information on the model and promising practices developed by SAMHSA’s National Registry of Effective Prevention Programs (NREP) that have been determined to prevent mental and behavioral disorders and promote mental health are available to family members; (4) broadly disseminate these materials to family-run organizations focused on children mental health through conference calls, Federation Listserv mechanisms, 2 regional meetings and by a pre-meetings at the annual Federation for Children’s Mental Health meeting; and (5) evaluate the success of the engagement of family members in knowledge and          activities related to the prevention of mental and behavioral disorders and the promotion of mental health, resulting in a final report to the Government.

The anticipated period of performance for this simplified acquisition is for twelve months.  Interested Small Business organizations, HUBZONE Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Veteran-owned Small Business, 8(a) Small Business should submit and original and two copies of their capability statement.  Will not accept e-mails or facsimiles.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENT RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.

<SUBJECT>Y -- USAID/Bosnia Community Integration and Stabilization Program
<DESC>USAID/Bosnia, through its administrative Regional Contracting Office located in USAID/RSC/RCO/Budapest, intends to modify Contract Number 168-C-00-01-00100-00 on or about September 1, 2003, using the “Other than Full and Open Competition” procedures allowed under Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1 (“Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.”).

This notice is being publicized in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(d)(2). Any proposals or bids received from any responsible source in response to this notice will be considered, however, this notice describes the entire technical requirement and no other solicitation documents are available.

USAID contract number 168-C-00-01-00100-00 with Parsons Deleware, Inc. was executed on December 22, 2000, in the amount of $54,188,829. The contract has been modified eleven times.  The current contract total estimated cost is $58,823,726.00.  The purpose of this contract is to provide engineering and design services, construction management services, and other construction services for the USAID/Bosnia Community Integration and Stabilization Program (CRSP).  The place of contractor performance is throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. The approximate total amount of this modification is estimated to not exceed $10.0 million, and is subject to the availability of funds.

Within the general scope of the existing contract’s work statement, USAID/Bosnia intends to request the contractor to provide additional construction services for up to approximately 20 building projects, as described below. Although available money clearly will not be sufficient to cover growing needs of war-related, refugee returnees, this modification will cover up to 20 potential projects that are considered to be priorities by USAID.  The projects are listed in priority order and will be funded in accordance to their priority and availability of funding.  

The estimated period of contract performance remains unchanged and runs from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2004. 

No further increase to the contract’s total estimated cost is envisioned.

It is the technical office determination that Parsons Deleware, Inc. is the only responsible source and that no other services will satisfy USAID requirements. The contractor has been working in war-torn communities of Bosnia and Herzegovina since contract execution and has effectively established technical and personal working relationships with local partners (public utility companies, de-mining organizations and affected communities leaders in the areas in which it operates).  Since all construction must be completed by September 30, 2004, and since a number of the construction activities listed below will take up to 12 months to prepare plans and specifications, subcontract and construct, the continued participation of the contractor is viewed as critical as the contract construction period comes to a conclusion.  Any replacement of the contractor at this time would also necessitate a costly re-mobilization, break-in period and rupture in building schedules as a new contractor attempts to form productive technical and working relationships with existing communities, stakeholders and clients, all within a sensitive and highly-charged political and social environment.
 
Illustrative construction activities will be found on the FED BIZ OPPS web site associated with this notice.

The basis for restricting competition was the proprietary information of Raytheon and the duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirement through any other source.  This synopsis is issued to advertise the options and requirements that will be met through orders placed under the BOA for a six-month period.

<SUBJECT>28--WIND TUNNEL DRIVE EFFICIENCY
<DESC>This document is for information and planning purposes only and will allow industry the opportunity to verify the reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition.  Comments or questions are requested by email only to Marianne.Shelley@nasa.gov no later than August 5, 2003. In responding reference RFI2-38245-MXS. This is NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS, nor is it  known at this time if a solicitation will result from this request for information.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be posted on the NASA Ames Business Opportunities website. Background: The main drive system for the NASA Ames Unitary Plan Wind Tunnels consist of 4 tandemly coupled wound rotor induction motors rated at 65,000 horse power each. The speed is controlled by a slip-regulator system which is very inefficient at less than near synchronous speeds. The operational speed range is 200-700 RPM with 720 RPM being synchronous. Below 300 RPM dynamic braking is applied to 1 or 2 of the motors to load the driving motor sufficiently to allow reasonable speed control. The number of motors driving the wind tunnel is sequentially controlled by the load reaching a preset level before the next motor is added. The system automatically balances the load between the motors.  NASA Ames Research Center is interested in commercially available technology that would reduce the inefficiencies of the slip-regulator while allowing the rapid and precise speed control of the motors over the stated speed range. We are also, interested in a rough order of magnitude (ROM) price to install and startup such a system. Information Requested: All responses should be limited to 10 pages of text, submitted in electronic format by Email to Marianne.Shelley@nasa.gov. Deadline for the submission is August 5, 2003. 1.  Describe the technology being offered and where it is being used. Describe the power level that it is being used in and the reliability that has been experienced. 2.	Provide a ROM cost for installing and starting up a system including line diagram of how the system will be connected to the existing system. We are interested in conceptually how it will tie into a typical slip regulator system. 3.	 Provide an estimate of the drive motor efficiency including the controls as a result of implementing this technology. 4.	   Provide references for systems that have been installed. Again, this is NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS, nor is it  known at this time if a solicitation will result from this request for information.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be posted on the NASA Ames Business Opportunities website. Comments or questions are requested by email only to Marianne.Shelley@nasa.gov no later than August 5, 2003. In responding reference RFI2-38245-MXS.

The Standby server automatically assumes the role of the Primary Server. Some of the benefits are instant disaster recovery, minimal downtime, remote data vaulting/data protection, business continuity, and avoid single point of failure. Offsite Archive for the Netware is an electronic data vaulting and disaster recovery product that allows you to transfer a stable point-in-time image of your data to an offsite location. Multiple Source Servers can mirror data to a single Target Server. OSA uses Snapshot servers to create snapshots of protected volumes which is then transferred from the Source Server to the Target Server. Once the initial synchronization of all the data is performed, only the delta changes are sent to the Target Server. Within minutes, the Source Server will take over the Target Server. Once the initial synchronization of all the data is performed, only the delta changes are sent to the Target Server.
