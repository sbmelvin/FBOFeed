The anticipated date of award is August 18, 2005.

The purpose of this project will provide SAMHSA with important
and valuable information that will be used to develop programs
to assist providers in promoting and facilitiating the use of
evidence-based practices within specialty mental health
services.  This project will support the production of two
reports:

The first report will identify issues that must be addressed
in order to enable specialty community providers to fully
implement specific EBPs, with particular attention to rate/payment issues.

The second report will identify data and reporting issues that need to be addressed in order to, decrease the overall paperwork
burden of providers; move to common data requirements for MH,
SA, and Medicaid; assess performance, productivity and quality
of care; and promote and measure the utilization of EBPs.

All reports, statistics, or tables produced under this project shall be the property of the Federal government. 

No other articles or publications which rely substantially
on materials produced under this project shall be
published by either party without prior consultation
and approval.

The contractor shall be responsible for, but not limited to
the following:

Meet with the PO and other CMHS/SAMHSA staff in order to determine the best approach for accomplishing the tasks covered by this contract.  Review the results of an ongoing CMHS
study, "Promoting Payment for Evidence-based Practices (EBPs)", which identifies the most significant EBPs in mental health (MH) services, and recommends specific EBPs by type of payer.
Modify the work plan in response to comments provided by the PO.

Utilize the contractor's ongoing technical assistance
activities, the contractor annual four-day training and
education conference, and other sources of information
available:

For evidence-based practices:
identify major issues and barriers to implementation of
specified EBPs, with particular emphasis on rate and payment issues;

obtain recommendations as to the priority of the various issues and barriers, and strategies for addressing them;

provide recommendations specific to major payer type (to at least include Medicaid, Medicare, Employer-based, and State-only).

For data:
identify and summarize the number, characteristics, and expenses (if available) of data and reporting systems required by payers, including those related to performance measures;

identify areas of inefficiency and overlap; identify needed changes to reduce paperwork burden on providers and improve the compatibility, quality, and specificity of administrative data for reporting, reimbursement, and administrative functions.

Summarize the results of these activities two reports
(20-30 pages each):

Report One:
Identifies major issues and barriers regarding implementation of EBPs in mental health settings; sets priorities and makes recommendations as to which 2 or 3 rate and payment issues/barriers should be addressed for each payer type, and
strategies for addressing them; includes a 1-page table that display these results in a matrix showing issues/barriers/ recommended strategies regarding EBPs by each payer type.

Report Two:
Describes the data/reporting issues that need to be addressed in order to:

decrease the overall paperwork burden of providers;
move to common data requirements for MH, SA, and Medicaid;
assess performance, productivity and quality of care; and

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the
Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source
Under Authority of Far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify
their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days
after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by
the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>Licensing of ORNL’s lightweight, portable sensor for the identification of chemical-biological species

UT-Battelle LLC (UT-Battelle), the management and operating contractor for the United States Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is seeking expressions of interest from companies interested in licensing and commercializing ORNL’s intellectual property in the technology area of high-sensitivity Raman spectroscopy for the identification of chemical-biological species.

ORNL’s Advanced Biomedical Science and Technology Group has developed a lightweight, portable sensor for the identification of chemical-biological species, including explosives, toxic chemicals, and drugs. (nicknamed RAMiTS - RAMan Integrated Tunable Sensor.)

This instrument is based upon high-sensitivity Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that can measure the vibrational signature of most chemicals, both solids and liquids. To obtain this chemical signature, laser light is focused onto the sample, and the resulting scattered light is collected and detected. Using this instrument for chemical and biological sample identification has several advantages over conventional analysis, including these:

The user need not contact the sample.
Analysis is rapid, in most cases 11 seconds or less.
An embedded computer system performs rapid automated sample identification.
User interaction with the system is via a touch screen.
RAMiTS operates on battery power, with a single-charge lifetime of 3 hours.
The instrument is watertight and can be decontaminated after exposure to CBW agents.

The technology transfer process will be facilitated through appropriate licensing of UT-Battelle’s intellectual property and associated research and development undertaken cooperatively between UT-Battelle and the licensee and funded by the licensee.  Research and development will focus on transitioning the technology from the current laboratory demonstration stage to commercialization.  Interested companies with experience and expertise commensurate with the requirements of this commercialization effort are invited to respond to this announcement.  Companies interested in this opportunity may obtain more detailed technical information and a description of the licensing and cooperative research and development process by submitting a statement of interest, including a written description of their company and its activities and an explanation of their potential application of the technology.  No licensing intermediaries please.  This is not a procurement activity.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate solely with Microsoft Corporation 5335 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 800, Washington, DC to add Microsoft Corporation  ‘Alliance’ support services to the current contract  that SSA has for Microsoft Consulting Support Services.  Under the authority provided in Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.106-1(b), the Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.  As a result of adding Alliance support, SSA will increase the maximum dollar ceiling of the consulting support services by $950,000.

As a result of adding the Alliance support, SSA will also extend the period of performance for an additional one year period. The current contract will expire in January 2006 and allows SSA to order Microsoft ‘Consulting’ support services.  These are services that are provided to advise SSA on planning, configuration and other pre-deployment issues.  Once the products are deployed, Microsoft requires that the customer utilize another category of services called ‘Alliance’.    This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Requests for copies of this solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.  The Government does not intend to pay for information received.  All interested parties must respond before the closing date of this notice.

<DESC>This is not a Request for Proposals.  This provides advance notice that a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) will be available on or about January 9, 2006.  The BAA will seek proposals to maximize the scientific yield from the biologic resource and associated participant exposure and outcome data generated by the Women's Health Initiative since 1993.  The Women's Health Initiative includes some 161,000 women in a set of overlapping clinical trials of post-menopausal hormone therapy, low fat dietary pattern, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation, as well as an observational study.  In general the BAA will seek the application of technologies that enable comprehensive yet efficient investigation of sets of markers associated with disease outcomes, or of modulators and mediators that might substantively explain the pathway of exposure or treatment effects on disease outcomes.  For example, genomic studies might include whole-genome, tag SNP, or haplotype approaches, and/or studies of sets of functional genes with related effects on an outcome.  Studies that combine information from genes and gene products in the form of blood proteins could help to elucidate pathways.  Studies on serum or plasma might include multiplex assays of panels of markers, for example adipokines or cytokines, which allow a large number of markers to be tested using a modest amount of sample.  Focused studies on a more limited number of candidate genes or candidate markers that need to be confirmed in a large dataset, and for which their validation has potential public health implications, will also be considered.  In order to conserve sample, consideration should be given to pooling approaches, or case-only approaches, as appropriate.  The primary disease outcomes will be cardiovascular diseases, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and fractures.  Detailed information on the WHI program will be found at www.whi.org on or about December 1, 2005.  The NHLBI anticipates awarding approximately 8-10 contracts for a two year period of performance based on technical merit, available funds, and programmatic balance.  Prospective Offerors are invited to attend a pre-proposal conference on February 27, 2006 from 1:00-3:00 pm, at the Natcher Building on the NIH Campus in Bethesda, Maryland.  NHLBI staff will explain the purpose of the initiative, provide instructions about the proposal process and answer questions.  Questions provided by February 20, 2006 will be answered at the conference.  Offeror institutions are urged to send a representative to this conference.  All attendees, as well as anyone who cannot attend the pre-proposal conference, will be given access, through an NHLBI web site,  to any distributed materials, questions and answers, and a summary of the discussion.  These materials and additional information about the meeting will be posted with the BAA.  Attendance is not a pre-requisite for proposal submission and will not be considered a factor in proposal evaluation.

<DESC>Opportunity to license ORNL’s patented statistical method and/or software for analysis of noisy, time-serial data in order to detect and forewarn of on-coming events in applications ranging from biomedical to industrial. 

Demonstrated biomedical applications to date include: forewarning (up to 4.5 hours) of human epileptic seizures from scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) data; forewarning of ventricular fibrillations and fainting (syncope) from human electrocardiogram (ECG) data; detection of septic shock due to inhaled endotoxin from rat ECG; and detection of breathing difficulty from chest sounds (with potential application in the remote monitoring of solders, emergency responders, etc).  R&D Magazine recently announced that the EEG implementation, known as “SeizAlert,” is a 2005 winner of its R&D100 award. 

Demonstrated industrial applications to date include: forewarning of failures in electric motors (air-gap offset, broken rotor, turn-to-turn short, and imbalance); motor-driven components (gears, bearings, pumps [imbalance and misalignment], rotating blades, drill bit wear) using a variety of process-indicative data (torque, vibration, electrical power, voltage, current); and forewarning via time-serial stress and strain data of structural failure by cracking. 

Details of related publications and patents are located at http://computing.ornl.gov/cse_home/staff/hively.shtml.  To date, licenses have been issued in forewarning of epileptic seizures, detection of cardiovascular disease, and monitoring for prediction of cardiovascular events.  All remaining biomedical, industrial, economic/financial, and other application areas remain available for licensing. 

The technology transfer process will be facilitated through licensing of UT-Battelle’s intellectual property, and subsequent development undertaken cooperatively between UT-Battelle and the licensee, funded by the licensee.  Such development will focus on transitioning the technology from the current laboratory demonstration stage to commercialization.  Interested companies with experience and expertise commensurate with the requirements of this commercialization effort are invited to respond to this announcement.  Companies interested in this opportunity may obtain more detailed technical information and a description of the licensing and cooperative research and development process by submitting a statement of interest, including a written description of their company and its activities and an explanation of their potential application of the technology.  No licensing intermediaries please.  This is not a procurement activity.

<DESC>R – Implementation and Knowledge Transfer of Sterling Commerce:  Connect:  Direct Software Product.  The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to negotiate with Sterling Commerce America, Inc., 12355 Sunrise Valley Drive, Suite 370, Reston, Virginia  20191-3458 on a sole source basis.  The simplified acquisition procedures will be utilized for this requirement for consulting services in accordance with the Statement of Work.

1. Purpose of Work	

Implementation Assistance for Connect: Direct for UNIX.
The DOC/NOAA/NFA/ISMO/FACD Computing Division has a mission of providing corporate administrative, financial, and management services for NOAA and the greater-Commerce community.  As part of this mission the Computing Division operates Digital Alpha Computer Systems which run the Commerce Business System (CBS) formally (CAMS) for NOAA.

CBS is intended to provide the foundation for financial services including issuance of payment information to the U.S. Treasury.  The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 mandates that all Government agencies use Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) exclusively for all payments, no later than January 1, 1999.  Connect Direct from Sterling Commerce is the Treasury recommended product to effect host-to-host, secure and traceable, file transfers of payment information.  This connection is provided both for HP Tru64 Primary and Secondary support systems.

DoC NOAA FACD (ITC) unique business requirements shall be discussed to develop an implementation task list for the purchased product(s). This plan shall outline a course to help gain the maximum return from the Connect: Direct for UNIX product(s) and meet required implementation time line. During this session, the consultant shall gather information about your trading partner and your communication environment. In addition, the Consultant shall work with NOAA to define immediate communication goals and discuss implementation of Connect: Direct for UNIX.
The implementation shall include the installation of the File Agent Option. 

Upon completion of the Connect: Direct for Unix Implementation, the Sterling Commerce consultant shall provide a transfer of knowledge to your designated staff member on the product(s) implementation and use.

2. Scope of Work
The assigned consultant shall install, configure and test Connect: Direct for UNIX on your development hosts.
During the installation process the consultant shall load the distribution media onto the customer’s host computer system, making sure it works as distributed by Sterling Commerce. This service only includes installing the software onto the customer’s system and verification testing with one Trading Partner to assure the installation was performed correctly. This service does not include product configuration beyond that required for verification, nor does it include formal training of the customer’s staff.

Upon completion of the Connect: Direct for UNIX implementation, the Sterling Commerce Consultant shall provide a transfer of knowledge to NOAA designated staff member on the product(s) implementation and use

Knowledge Transfer shall include enabling Connect: Direct for UNIX to be started automatically, discussing the checkpoint/restart function, the understanding of the audit trail of data movement and the capabilities of the File Agent.

The Consultant shall assist NOAA in configuring Connect: Direct for UNIX to communicate with one trading partner. This assistance shall include the local and remote definitions required, security requirements, assistance in the creation of inbound and outbound scripts for data transmission and the verification of successful completion of data exchange with a remote trading partner.

Verification testing shall consist of configuring the installed product(s) to run a sample test data flow. Once the sample data has been loaded, it shall be run through the product(s) to verify that everything has been installed correctly. No other product(s) configuration shall be provided beyond this.

Connect Direct is a proprietary product of Sterling Commerce and, as such, is only supported by them.  No other sources exist for support of this product of this product, which is critical to meeting the requirements for EFT as mandated by federal law.

All interested parties must make the request via e-mail to obtain a copy of the Request for Quotation and Statement of Work.  For additional information, please contact G.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis and issue a modification to an existing contract with Titan/Datron Advanced Technologies Division (Titan/Datron), 200 W. Los Angeles Avenue, Simi Valley, California 93065-1650, for additional units of: (1) Elevation axis gear box assemblies; (2) Azimuth axis gear box assemblies; and (3) Third axis gear box assemblies. These additional units will increase reliability of components and provide consistency and compatibility as well as maintenance and spare parts on the existing units. Due to failures on the original components, the manufacturer has improved the material design used in the gears. NOAA intends to replace all gears in their antennas of this type.

The Fairbanks (Alaska) Command and Data Acquisition Station (FCDAS) site is a primary ground station for telemetry, command and control (TT&C) of polar-orbiting satellites, including the NOAA/POES, NRL/WindSat Coriolis, DoD/USAF/DMSP, NASA missions, as well as the NOAA geostationary program, GOES. The Wallops CDA facility in Virginia tracks POES and GOES Missions. Both stations use the Titan/Datron 13 Meter TT&C antenna system, Model 8450. Titan/Datron is the OEM for the antennas at Wallops and Fairbanks. These additional units will be delivered to NOAA facilities in Wallops, Virginia, and Fairbanks, Alaska. Operational gearbox units, matching the configuration of the proposed additional gearbox, already exist in these NOAA facility locations. It is the Government’s intent to compete any additional units in the future. Responses to this notice shall be submitted no later than c.o.b. August 10, 2005.
 
No solicitation will be released for this requirement. If an interested offeror believes it can offer a brand name or equal item based on Government requirements, it shall respond within the specified date, to the agency contact point, describing how it can satisfy the Government’s needs without causing unacceptable delays, duplicating costs, or failure to meet technical objectives.

BACKGROUND.  The US Air Force provides global civil engineering support activities through a variety of contract vehicles maintained by AFCESA and its sister field operating agency, the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE).  Current Air Force major contractual programs address environmental restoration, military family housing, contingency, and the military construction program (MILCON).  The SATOC represents the primary contract vehicle for AFCESA’s newly formed S/R&M program and primarily supports existing Air Force facilities and infrastructure.  The program supports a range of S/R&M efforts with both small (<$100K) and large task orders (>$5M) expected.

PROGRAM INFORMATION.  The SATOC contractual program will meet AFCESA customer requirements worldwide, including locations in remote, austere, and hostile environments.  The acquisition strategy contemplated is awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts with multiple pricing arrangements (i.e. Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee, (CPFF).  The anticipated total program ceiling is $10 billion over a ten-year period.  We anticipate awarding a number of contracts under full and open competition procedures, and 8(a) set-aside procedures.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 236220 with an applicable size standard of $28,500,000.  

We anticipate releasing the RFP on or about 25 Nov 05.  The RFP will be issued via the FedBizOps. http://www.EPS.gov

<DESC>NOTE:     In accordance with the Agreement of Defense and Cooperation between the Kingdom of Spain and the United States of America, any contract resulting from this notice/solicitation can only be entered into with companies authorized to carry out these activities in Spain under Spanish law. Companies must meet the requirements established by Spanish legislation for execution of Government works. Obtaining a license or permission to operate your company in Spain may be a long process; therefore, any company anticipating interest in future projects should immediately begin the processes that will be required, by contacting the Delegation of Industry. They have two offices; one in the Madrid province and one in the Andalucia province. The telephone numbers are: 011 34 91 580 2100 (Madrid) and 011 34 95 507 8620 for Andalucia. The Air Force intends to solicit proposals for a Firm-Fixed Price contract to Paint the Water Tower. Contract magnitude is between $100,000 and $250,000. The successful contractor will be selected using Past Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPPT) procedures resulting in the best value to the Government. Past Performance will be rated significantly higher than price. You are requested to notify the contracting officer, thomas.finch@moron.af.mil if you intend to download the solicitation. It is highly recommended that you register to be notified of any new postings for this pre-solicitation notice and or any other postings published by our office. However, remember that the notification of changes that result from registration is only a service and any failure of the service to notify you of changes cannot be used against the Government in any way, shape, or form. Therefore, you should check EPS frequently for any new postings that may have been made. As a last resort, if you cannot download the pre-solicitation from the EPS internet site, we will provide a CD ROM Disk, however, you must provide two working day notice (workdays are Monday through Friday except Spanish and American holidays) of your request for a CD ROM Disk to the above e-mail address or via fax at 95 584 8054. The Government anticipates and reserves the right to issue all solicitation documents including specifications and drawings in the English language only.

In order to be awarded a contract by the U.S. Government in excess of $25,000, the company must have a DATA UNIVERSAL NUMBERING SYSTEM (DUNS) NUMBER. If you do not already have one, it is suggested you contact Dunn and Bradstreet at www.dnb.com/dunsno/whereduns.htm or www.dun.es/. Failure to have a DUNS Number at the time of award may delay the award, and depending on the criticality of the project, may be cause to award to the next qualified offeror who has a valid DUNS Number. All contractors are advised that they shoudl be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). Registration can be made on line at http://www.ccr2000.com/. NOTE: You must have a DUNS Number to register. Furthermore, in accordance with Section L, Provision L-204, a COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT ENTITY (CAGE) CODE REPORTING is required.

<DESC>The Navy anticipates award of a service contract that will cover FY 06-08  service requirements related to the Trident, Los Angeles, Virginia, and Seawolf submarine storage batteries.  This will be a sole source procurement to Exide Technologies, Aurora, IL. based on FAR 6.302-1, only one source capable of meeting the Government’s requirements.  A firm-fixed price contract is anticipated.  Requirements covered will be field and maintenance services for Exide main storage batteries on submarines that are in service (i.e., not under construction).  The majority of batteries currently in use are flooded lead acid batteries but the Navy is transitioning to Valve-Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA batteries); installation of batteries will begin to shift away from flooded lead acid to VRLA batteries.  As part of the field services effort the contractor will be required to make routine visits at least once a year to each submarine as authorized by the Government, and make emergency v! isits as authorized.  The maintenance portion of the effort requires the contractor to have a complete maintenance program for all batteries on submarines.  Requirements specific to battery type require assistance in the planning, installation, testing, checkout, adjustment, disassembly and repair of submarine battery cells; and performance of on-the-job instruction and training of Navy personnel (military and/or civilian).  It is estimated that the 4.5 man-years per year will be necessary to complete requirements.  The applicable NAICS classification is 541330 and the size standard is $23M.   A Confidential Security Clearance is required.  Interested parties may submit inquiries or request a copy of the solicitation by sending a fax to the number shown above or send a request via e-mail to mailto:roger.brett@navy.mil.  The solicitation will be available on or about 9 August 2005 via the Internet at the NSWC Crane Homepage at http://www.crane.navy.mil and will close on or ab! out 9 September 2005.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in a negotiated procurement for the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) requirement for a cost-effective means of mailing response documents to its customers.  This contract will provide NPRC with a means to utilize U. S. Postal Service (USPS) discounts and improve delivery of service. The NPRC, located in Saint Louis, Missouri, is the largest single component of NARA. The NPRC is comprised of two separate facilities, located approximately 18 miles apart; one for Civilian Personnel Records (CPR) and one for Military Personnel Records (MPR).  Each facility performs similar, but distinct, missions of providing storage of, and referencing information from, records which document an individual’s service for the U.S. Government.  The services performed at MPR are primarily supportive of the rights and benefits of U.S. military veterans and their families.  These benefits include health care, home loan guarantees, education, service-connected injury compensation, burial allowances and assistance to homeless veterans.  There are close to 56 million military records stored at the MPR facility, as well as another 39 million parts of record-related items that are used for records reconstruction purposes.  The majority of the records are the Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) records of former military service men and women.  As a central repository for these service records, MPR responds to a high volume of reference inquiries and requests for copies. CPR provides storage and reference service on the Official Personnel Folders (OPFs) and Employee Medical Folders (EMFs) of separated Federal civilian employees.  This facility performs reference services, including the loan or return of records to the agency of origin, preparation of authenticated reproductions of documents, and furnishing information extracted from the records. CPR receives from Federal Agencies approximately 650,000 OPFs, EMFs, and x-rays annually.  The objective of this contract is to provide for mail pre-sort services (e.g., pick-up, meter and process letter mail, flat mail and parcels; presort and barcode) at MPR and CPR. MPR and CPR will release their mail to the Contractor for processing prior to dispatch to the USPS.  The Contractor must provide all management, supervision, manpower, equipment and supplies, and must plan, schedule and coordinate and ensure effective performance necessary to provide presort mail services.  The Contractor will be required to provide a minimum of presort mail and barcode service applicable to the postage discount level offered, for domestic 1st Class Federal practices, and all USPS Coding Accuracy Support System (CASS) certification throughout the term of this contract and any option period.  The contract awarded as a result of this RFP will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with Department of Labor wage determinations incorporated. The Term of the contract will be for a Base Period of twelve (12) months plus four (4) twelve (12) month Option Periods. The requirement is a 100% small business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561499 and the Small Business Size Standard is $6.0 Million. All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by NARA. Copies of the RFP, which will be available on or about August 4, 2005, may be obtained through the Federal Business Opportunities web site at www.fedbizopps.gov. It is the Offeror’s responsibility to monitor this site for the release of the solicitation and amendments, if any. All Contractors interested in receiving notification of updates/amendments to the solicitation posted on the EPS are urged to enroll on the web site mailing list for this acquisition. Those Contractors enrolled will be notified automatically of any changes made to the RFP through their e-mail addresses. No telephone or fax RFP request will be accepted. *****

<DESC>Description of Work: The project areas are within dense stands of ponderosa pine that are at high risk of drought-induced bark beetle attack, as well as a risk of wildfire.  The purposes of the project is to reduce hazardous fuels surrounding wildland urban interfaces, provide a study area for fire surrogate plots, and improve stand health by reducing the overall stand density.  This thinning will enhance residual tree vigor and thus reduce the chances for ponderosa pine mortality from bark beetles.  Treatment of the resulting woody debris and slash will both remove the potential attractant to bark beetles as well as making the residual stand more fire resistant into the future.  To accomplish these goals, this project includes several different components: timber removal (commercial thinning), pre-commercial thinning, and slash treatment by decking, mastication, chipping or removing. Jemez Ranger District, Santa Fe National Forest, New Mexico.  Note:  The solicitation for this project will not be available electronically.  All requests must be in writing via email or fax.

<DESC>Description of Work- The Jemez Campground Forest Health – Jemez Falls Campground Stewardship Project is located on the Jemez Ranger District of the Santa Fe National Forest.  The project area lies adjacent to State Highway 4, and borders the southern boundary of the Valles Caldera National Preserve.  The Project Area encompasses 217 acres surrounding the Jemez Falls Campground, with State Highway 4 and the Preserve on the northern boundary, and the breaks into the East Fork of the Jemez River on the eastern boundary.  The project area centers around a popular campground located within dense stands of ponderosa pine that are at high risk of drought-induced bark beetle attack, as well as a risk of wildfire.  The primary purpose of the project is to improve stand health by reducing the overall stand density by up to 50%.  This thinning will enhance residual tree vigor and thus reduce the chances for ponderosa pine mortality from bark beetles.  Treatment of the resulting woody debris and slash will both remove the potential attractant to bark beetles as well as making the residual stand more fire resistant into the future.  To accomplish these goals, this project includes several different components: timber removal (commercial thinning), pre-commercial thinning, and slash treatment by decking, chipping or removing. NOTE:  This solicitation will not be available electronically.  All requests for copies of this solicitation must be requested via email or fax (505-346-3909).

<DESC>Description of Work- The Jemez Campground Forest Health – Paliza Campgrounds Stewardship Project is located on the Jemez Ranger District of the Santa Fe National Forest.  The project area lies within and adjacent to the Paliza Group and Family Campgrounds, accessible via Forest Road 10.  The project area centers around two popular campgrounds located within dense stands of ponderosa pine that are at high risk of drought-induced bark beetle attack, as well as a risk of wildfire.  The primary purpose of the project is to improve stand health by reducing the overall stand density by up to 50%.  This thinning will enhance residual tree vigor and thus reduce the chances for ponderosa pine mortality from bark beetles.  Treatment of the resulting woody debris and slash will both remove the potential attractant to bark beetles as well as making the residual stand more fire resistant into the future.  To accomplish these goals, this project includes several different components: timber removal (commercial thinning), precommercial thinning, and slash treatment by decking, chipping or removing. NOTE: This solicitation will not be available electronically, all requests for a copy of the solicitation must be in writing via email or fax (505-346-3909).

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) in Silver Spring, MD, intends to enter into a sole source agreement with Arinc Managed Services, LLC in Annapolis, MD.  Arinc Managed Services provides the Meteorological Collection and Dissemination System (MCDS) for air to ground weather conditions and activity to NOAA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  The period of performance is from August 15, 2005 through March 16, 2006.  This synopsis is being issued to notify interested parties that Southwest Airlines is joining the other six reporting carriers who support the MCDS.  The airlines that support the MCDS are chosen based on their routes and frequency of flights.  Adding Southwest Airlines to the MCDS will help fill in gaps that the FAA and NOAA currently have for the dissemination of this information.  Arinc is the single largest supplier of air-to-ground communications  for the nation’s air carriers.  Arinc provides the communications infrastructure that allows Southwest and other carriers to provide NOAA and the FAA with weather observations data.  No other communication infrastructure can communicate between Southwest planes and Arinc.  Arinc’s unique air–to-ground relationship with the nation’s air carriers will assist the Government in developing strategies to optimize the MCDS data collection in a way that minimizes cost and maximizes positive impact to aviation and public safety from improved weather forecasts.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested companies may submit an affirmative response to the requirement within 15 days from the posting date of this notice to mark.a.miller@noaa.gov or via fax to 301-608-0876.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A fixed-price purchase order is contemplated for this effort in accordance with FAR Subpart 12 acquisition of commercial items.  See note 22   

    Aircraft Observation Data Collection and Optimization
                         Statement of Work

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS) desires to have Southwest Airlines (SWA) participate in the Meteorological Data Collection and Reporting System (MDCRS) and has agreed to pay a portion of the cost incurred by SWA for the communications of MDCRS data.  MDCRS data are wind and temperature reports gathered by commercial aircraft along their respective flight tracks and centrally collected using a commercial air-to-ground communications network.  MDCRS data from United States commercial air carriers have been used for over 10 years to help observe the atmosphere in support of improvements to operational NWS forecasts.
	
1.	Functional Description

ARINC, Inc., receives, decodes, and encodes Automated Meteorological Reports from Commercial Aircraft (ACARS), formats these ACARS messages containing meteorological data into the Binary Universal Form for the Representation (BUFR) meteorological data file format, and transmits these MDCRS BUFR files to the NWS Telecommunications Operations Center (TOC) in Silver Spring, Maryland, through a dedicated circuit between ARINC in Annapolis, Maryland and the NWS TOC in Silver Spring, Maryland.  

ACARS messages are routed over the ARINC ground network to the airline computers. MDCRS messages are separated from other messages and are sent to the NWS over NADIN II and to the FSL over the ARINC ground network.  

2. Service Support –Southwest Airlines Weather Report Collection and Monitoring

ARINC currently provides MDCRS data collection, formatting, and distribution services under an existing contract with the FAA (NWS cost shares with FAA on this contract).  Approximately 1500 aircraft operated by the six airlines provide data for the MDCRS program.  The number of MDCRS messages processed by ARINC typically exceeds 1.2 million per month.  

The government desires SWA weather reports be disseminated to ARINC during the aircraft’s ascent phase of flight from about 100 B-737 aircraft, as identified by Southwest Airlines, be incorporated into the existing FAA contracted MDCRS BUFR meteorological data file.  

ARINC will provide engineering support for the integration of the new SWA MDCRS weather reports into the existing FAA BUFR file.  ARINC will also collaborate with SWA and the NWS to identify and resolve problems that occur in the data collection and distribution process.

As part of the existing FAA MDCRS contract, ARINC will provide on-call engineering support, on a 24-hour by 7-day per week basis, through the ARINC Network Operations Center.  As a part of this engineering support, ARINC will monitor and maintain the network to insure the availability of the MDCRS service to the NWS TOC, to include Southwest MDCRS data availability.  This ARINC service has historically achieved a >98% for MDCRS data availability to the NWS TOC.  

3. Additional Engineering Support – Data Optimization Functional Requirements Development

The NWS desires to implement a capability to select certain aircraft to provide MDCRS messages from participating aircraft in order to optimize the collection of MDCRS data according to its mission needs (e.g. observations when and where needed) and reduce the message communications cost to the government and the airlines resulting from redundant data collection.  ARINC does not currently have the capability to schedule the collection of meteorological data to meet the NWS requirements by sending messages to aircraft to enable or disable MDCRS reporting.  

ARINC will work with the NWS to define the technical and operational requirements for a data scheduling capability, called the MDCRS Data Scheduling and Collection System.  ARINC will draft a Requirements Document, review the document with the NWS and revise it as necessary to arrive at a final document that accurately reflects the government’s requirements for a MDCRS Data Scheduling and Collection System.  This effort will be completed by March 31, 2006.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland requires a Contractor to provide research and development for measuring the implementation of best practices for project security.

NIST’s Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) has as its mission to meet the measurement and standards needs of the building and fire safety communities.  A key element of that mission is BFRL’s commitment to homeland security.  Specifically, the goal of BFRL’s homeland security effort is to develop and implement the standards, technology, and practices needed for cost-effective improvements to the safety and security of buildings and building occupants, including evacuation, emergency response procedures, and threat mitigation.  The strategy to meet this goal is supported by BFRL’s:

•	research and development (R&D) program to provide a technical foundation that supports improvements to building and fire codes, standards, and practices that reduce the impact of extreme threats to the safety of buildings, their occupants and emergency responders; and
	
•	dissemination and technical assistance program (DTAP) to engage leaders of the construction and building community in implementing proposed changes to practices, standards, and codes.  DTAP will also provide practical guidance and tools to better prepare facility owners, contractors, architects, engineers, emergency responders, and regulatory authorities to respond to future disasters.

The results of this research study will provide guidance for implementing security-related practices during the delivery process of chemical manufacturing, energy production and distribution, and transportation infrastructure projects.  By focusing on the project delivery process—planning through start-up—this research increases the likelihood that cost-effective protective measures will be implemented.

This research effort has three distinct tasks.  These tasks are: (1) a statistical analysis of a broad cross-section of projects drawn from the chemical manufacturing, energy production and distribution, and transportation infrastructure sectors; (2) a case-by-case analysis of “exemplary” projects drawn from the chemical manufacturing, energy production and distribution, and transportation infrastructure sectors; and (3) a technical report synthesizing findings from the research effort.

Procurement Method:

This will be an unrestricted competitive procurement to be conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, since NIST has determined that a small business set-aside is not appropriate based on its market research. 

North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541690 will apply to the procurement, with a small business size standard of $6.0 million.

The Government contemplates award of a single Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) purchase order with a period of performance from date of purchase order acceptance through May 31, 2006 for requirements specified in the Request for Quotations (RFQ).

RFQ is anticipated to be posted on www.fedbizopps.gov on or about August 12, 2005.  The solicitation, solicitation amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement will only be made available via www.fedbizopps.gov.   Potential offerors are encouraged to monitor www.fedbizopps.gov periodically to determine when the RFQ has been posted.

There is no incumbent Contractor for this acquisition.

No bidders list is being maintained for this procurement.

Quotations will be due no later than ten (10) days after RFQ is release unless the RFQ is amended to extend the due date for quotations.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Provide Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary with coastal signage.
National Marine Sanctuaries were authorized by the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972. Through this act, the Secretary of Commerce can designate an area with significant cultural or biological resources as a Marine Sanctuary and provide these areas and their resources with special protection. Marine Sanctuaries are administered by the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS) within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The goal of the National Marine Sanctuary System is to protect and manage these marine resources through research, education, and interpretation. 

The ONMS, has been given responsibility for the management and conservation of ecological, recreational, historic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational resources within the waters of the designated National Marine Sanctuaries.  Today, there are 13 National Marine Sanctuaries in the waters off the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf of Mexico coasts, in the Great Lakes and surrounding the Pacific Islands.  Four of these National Marine Sanctuaries are located off the coast of California with offices in the following locations: 

Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (NMS):  Santa Barbara and Oxnard, CA
Cordell Bank NMS:  Point Reyes National Seashore, CA
Gulf of the Farallones NMS:  San Francisco and Half Moon Bay, CA
Monterey Bay NMS:  Monterey, Santa Cruz, and San Simeon, CA

Among its missions, ONMS is required to educate the public, through various outreach activities, on the resources contained within the waters of the Sanctuaries.  As part of its education program, NMSP has embarked on an initiative to develop, fabricate and install outdoor information and interpretive signage at all the Sanctuaries. In the case of California, all four Sanctuaries have developed a shared signage strategy to ensure a common look and feel to the signs as well as an integrated messaging approach along the coastline.  These interpretive signs will be located at various public locations such as overlooks, beaches and other popular ocean-view sites that are managed by federal, state or private partners.  The signs will provide information to the public about each sanctuary, their mission as well as the waters and environments they manage. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $50,000

A selection committee will review and evaluate contractor qualifications and select a minimum of three (3) of the most highly qualified D-B firms/teams based on the established RFQ evaluation criteria to participate in Phase Two of this D-B selection process.  During Phase Two, those firms/teams short-listed will be sent a Request for Proposal (RFP), which will outline the remainder of the process requirements.  The RFP will contain the requirements necessary for the short-listed D-B teams/firms to submit both a Technical Proposal and a Price Proposal during Phase Two.  Those firms will be required to provide the necessary information to the EFLHD within 60 calendar days after receiving the RFP.  A site visit/pre-proposal meeting will be held within the first 21 days of this period to provide additional information.  It is anticipated that a stipend will be awarded to each Phase Two offeror who provides a responsive, but unsuccessful proposal (see Subsection I.A.6 of the RFP).  A copy of the draft RFP is available to interested D-B firms/teams during Phase One.

After receipt of the Phase Two Technical and Price Proposals, an Evaluation Board will conduct a “best value” analysis (see Subsection I.B.6 of the RFP), and submit their recommendations to the Selection Official for approval.  Award of one Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated approximately January 15, 2005, with Notice to Proceed issued approximately February 15, 2005.

It is not the intent of EFLHD to receive project specific design or engineering recommendations as part of this Phase One selection process.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to post questions and answers to the above referenced Broad Agency Announcement:

FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY ADMINISTRATION
SOLICITATION NO. DTMC75-05-BAA-00001
SMART PARK

Outstanding Questions

1.	The BAA, under “Technical Approach,” requires estimates of capital and annual O&M costs.  Is it your intent that these cost estimates pertain to (1) the demonstration period, or (2) some point in the future, after the project is completed, and the technology is rolled out?

The required cost estimates should pertain to the future after the project is completed and the technology is rolled out.  

2.	The BAA, also under “Technical Approach,” directs offerors to “base estimates on these assumptions: (i) a group of three truck stops within a 50-mile circle, each with 50 parking spaces…”  Is this assumption also a requirement for the demonstration – namely, that a minimum of three truck stops, all within a 50-mile radius of each other, must be outfitted with the demonstration technology?

This assumption does NOT apply to the demonstration because it may not be practicable for all proposed test sites.  The assumption is required for making the cost estimates so that the cost estimates for different technologies proposed by different bidders can be evaluated on the basis of a common assumption.  

3.	Section 1.6 of the BAA states that USDOT “will conduct an independent evaluation of the project…”   Please provide guidance on the scope and context of the independent evaluation that you intend to conduct?

At this time, U.S. DOT has not yet determined the scope and context of the independent evaluation.  The bidder is free to propose its own evaluation; however, as mentioned in section 1.4 of the Broad Agency Announcement, FMCSA may choose to fund an entire proposal or a portion of a proposal.    

4.	Section 1.7 of the BAA states that “FMCSA is contemplating a cost-type contract, but offerors may propose an alternate contract type.”  Does FMCSA have objections to a time-and-materials contract being proposed?

Yes.        

5.	We are having difficulty confirming your allowable page count for Section C: Detailed Technical Summary of the proposal.  The total page count stipulated in the BAA for Section C is 32 pages.  However, the actual specified maximum page counts for individual sections appears to total 34 pages, as follows:

•	Description of Technology (7 pages)
•	Technical Approach (2 pages)   
•	Statement of Work (17 pages)
•	Description of Proposed Test Sites (3 pages)
•	Previous Accomplishments (3 pages)
•	Facilities and Equipment (2 pages)

On the other hand, our count of allowable pages for the entire Volume I proposal – exclusive of Appendices – seems to come to only 55 pages, rather than the 61 specified in the BAA:

•	Cover Sheet (1 page)
•	Cover Letter (1 page)
•	Table of Contents (1 page)
•	Section B: Summary of Proposal (6 pages)
•	Section C: Detailed Technical Summary (34 pages)
•	Section D: Management Approach (12 pages)

Please clarify.

What is termed “Technical Approach (2 pages)” really falls under or is a subdivision under “Description of Technology (7 pages).” In other words, “Technical Approach” is not an individual section separate from and equal to “Description of Technology.”  If two pages are needed to discuss “Technical Approach,” these two pages will be counted against the total of 7 pages for “Description of Technology.”  Consequently, the maximum page count for “Section C: Detailed Technical Summary” remains at 32 pages. 

With the maximum page count for “Section C: Detailed Technical Summary” as 32 pages, the maximum page limit for Volume I of the proposal – exclusive of appendices – should be 53 pages, rather than the 61 pages originally specified.

The following is a modification to solicitation 2 to answer questions:
Several questions have been asked on RFP FA8104-05-R-414:

1.	Question:  Page 106 of RFP, paragraph 4.1.1, states “the following Table will be used to evaluate the offeror’s Demonstration Disk.”  Please clarify which requirements must be addressed on the demo disk.  Some requirements, such as 6.2 Travel, will be addressed in the proposal, but not in the demo disk. 
Answer:  All elements in paragraph 4.1.1 must be addressed, either in the demonstration disk, or by narrative in the proposal.

2.	Question:  Page 112 of RFP, paragraph 5.11, states “offerors are to provide labor, fringe benefits, overhead and G&A rates by year for all labor categories anticipated for use in the performance of this effort.”  Is this information required, particularly for GSA schedule line items that are priced per page? 
Answer:  The instructions indicate that this information is normally provided within the GSA schedule.  That is the only requirement.  CLIN prices are to be by unit price and extended price.

3.	Question:  Page 116 of RFP, paragraph 6.3.5.  Please clarify…is a subcontracting plan required since this solicitation is set aside for small business? 
Answer:  A subcontracting plan is not required for a small business.

4.	Question:  Page 121 of RFP, paragraph 2.4.b, states the offeror must propose an “approach to comply with the DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification and…”  It is our understanding that this solicitation contains no classified data.  Is this requirement applicable? 
Answer:  This should have been deleted from the instructions.  It is not applicable.

5.	Question.  Page 121 of RFP, paragraph 2.4.d, states the offeror must propose a “Safety Program/Plan that ensures the protection of Government property and personnel IAW the Safety, Fire Protection and Health Specification, Appendix “C” to the contract.”  There is no Appendix C to the RFP.  Is a Safety Program/Plan applicable to this solicitation? 
Answer:  There is no Appendix C; however, each offeror must propose a Safety Plan within the proposal to address the requirements of the RFP.  It can be as an Appendix or other narrative within the Mission Capability volume.

<DESC>AFWay II RFI Update <BR><BR> Final Business Management Modernization Program approval for the modernization project was given with the following condition: <BR><BR> "The functionality in AFeBuy* that duplicates functionality in the Department of Defense Electronic Mall (DoDEMALL) must not be used.  For that functionality, DoDEMALL must be used instead." <BR><BR> *AFWay II was referred to as AFeBuy when going through the BMMP approval process. <BR><BR> DoD eMall has told the AFWay Program Office they can provide, to varying degrees, the following functionality required for AFWay II: <BR><BR> On-line Help/Training,	User Registration/Profile,	Role-based Access, Product Search,	Product Comparison,	On-line Catalogs, Access to external catalogs,	Shopping Cart,	Waiver, Request for Quote (RFQ)	Customizable Workflow,	Multiple Funding Sources Ordering,	System Administration,	System Access, Security and Privacy <BR><BR> Because this condition is more restrictive than the one cited in the RFI ("The AFeBuy solution has duplicative capabilities relative to DoD EMALL, in particular electronic catalogs. Therefore, where duplication between these solutions exists, DoD EMALL must be leveraged."), the program office requests any additional feedback you would like to provide on the impact of leveraging within a COTS solution the DoD eMall functionality listed above.  Again, we ask for feedback on: <BR> a.	Feasibility of integration<BR> b.	Impact on cost and schedule for implementing the new solution<BR> c.	Impact on performance of new solution<BR> d.	Risks<BR> e.	Recommendation<BR> <BR> If the more restrictive condition would change the response you provided to question 7 of the RFI and you would like to provide an updated response, please send your comments electronically to Patricia Beasley at patricia.beasley@gunter.af.mil with a copy to the Contracting Officer, Dwynell Streeter at dwynell.streeter@gunter.af.mil.

<DESC>SURVIVAL RADIO BATTERY RECHARGER
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available software database applications.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, is planning to conduct a study that will evaluate commercial options to solve the following problem:  

United States Air Force units require a light-weight ability to recharge survival radio batteries in a field location or survival situation at any time of day or night.  The AWB is interested in commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products that could be used as-is or slightly modified to solve this problem.

These attributes are desired requirements by the USAF:
	
	1. Recharger should recharge batteries used in the CSEL and PRC-112/G 	survival radios.  Batteries are made by various manufacturers.  Examples: 
	PRC-112 battery Mathews BB-2812G, CSEL battery AN/PRQ-7 (Li-Ion).
	2. Recharger must function day or night.
	3. Total weight less than one-half (½) lb. 
	4. Easily fit in a survival vest pocket (pocket size 5” x 2.5” x 2.5”).  Smaller is 
	preferred.
	5. Operation should be nearly silent. 
	6. Must be easy to use in a field location or survival situation and require no electricity.

The AWB is seeking the following specific information from industry representatives: 

	1. The manufacturers suggested retail price and/or a schedule of lease pricing for 
	the commercial product.
	2. The name of distributors who could sell to the Government.
	3. The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the above desirable and 
	beneficial attributes of the USAF.

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 19 Aug 05 to Major Cathy Blacklock, Air Warfare Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648 or Email cathy.blacklock@mountainhome.af.mil.  Major Blacklock can be reached at (208) 828-3542.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information -- marked with a Proprietary legend -- received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<CONTACT>Anita Tolliver Contract Specialist 7037871092     Anita.Tolliver@mms.gov;
<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The US Department of Interior, through its Franchise Fund activity GovWorks on behalf of the US Department of Interior (acting through the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service) and US Department of Agriculture (acting through the US Forest Service) is seeking sources with the capabilities to design, produce, fulfill, market and implement a new Federal Recreational Lands Pass known as the America the Beautiful Pass.  The Government is performing market research to determine if there is one source that can fulfill the Government's requirement or if contractor teaming arrangements (which may include non-profits or other organizations) can fulfill the Government's requirement.  If the requirement cannot be fulfilled through one source or contractor teaming arrangements, the Government would like to receive capability statements from those firms for the part of the requirement that they can fulfill.  The Government is seeking innovative and creative solutions to fulfill this requirement. For this requirement, the Government recognizes the long-term, ongoing, and valued relationships with non-profits such as the National Park Foundation, the National Forest Foundation, and others.  The Government anticipates that these partnerships will continue.  This acquisition should not be construed as precluding the current non-profit partners from the opportunities that they currently have including the National Park Foundation's administration of the contest for the 2007 image.   The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) passed in December 2004 requires five (5) Federal land management agencies to develop and implement a new Federal lands recreation pass known as the America the Beautiful (ATB) pass.  The pass will be valid for entry at Federal recreation sites that charge entrance or standard amenity fees.  The new pass is scheduled to be introduced in 2007, and will replace existing recreation pass programs (Golden Eagle, Golden Age, and Golden Access Passports and the National Parks Pass).  For information on existing pass programs, visit http://www.recreation.gov/recpass.cfm.   The ATB shall provide similar benefits to the existing pass programs, but the Government anticipates that its design shall be updated, as compared to existing passes, and it shall be marketed through multiple sales channels.  It is anticipated that increases in sales, relative to current National Parks Pass and Golden Eagle sales, will allow the agencies to help provide important visitor services, deferred maintenance, education, outreach, and other services and enhance relationships with partners who can bring additional support to Federal lands. The services required to establish the new America the Beautiful Pass shall include, but not be limited to, overall pass design (except that images, selected through an annual contest, are expected to be provided to the contractor), web sales, developing and providing collateral materials such as hangtags, decals for open topped vehicles, a guidebook, etc.; pass fulfillment (for federal sites that sell the pass as well as for third party sales); pass inventory, tracking of sales and revenues by agency, and accountability; marketing, and distribution. Interested businesses shall provide the Government with (1) Name of Company-include a contact person's name, telephone number, and email address; (2) Company Address; (3) Company Size; (4) Identify whether the services identified above are of a type offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace based on established catalog or market prices and whether these services are exclusively provided to the Government; (5) Identify standard commercial terms and conditions typically associated with these services; (6) Describe experience, capabilities, and past performance with similar types of requirements of similar scope and magnitude and whether they were performance-based - include the contract number; Government agency/Company name and address; contract funded amount; (7) Identify existing or potential pricing structure in support of this type of work; and (8) Identify qualifications of technical and management personnel. ***** THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND A CONTRACT WILL NOT BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS. ***** Firms interested in performing this requirement may reply to this RFI by 8:00am EST August 19, 2005, addressing the elements above and any processes that would be used. Responses shall include one original and eight (8) copies.  There is a 10-page limit for the response not including pamphlets, brochures, samples or other literature to support the 10-page capability statement.  Proprietary processes or data must be clearly marked and documented as such.  Respondents should include your firms Dun and Bradstreet Number (DUNS), Tax Identification Number (TIN) and Central Contractor Register Number (CCR). The Government will not pay for any materials furnished in response to this synopsis. Submittals furnished will not be returned to sender.  Requests for other pertinent information and questions may be address to: atb@mms.gov.

<DESC>The Department of Labor (DOL) is conducting market research to locate sources and information on commercially-available exposure matrices in Support of Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program.  The DOL does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Source Sought notice or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this request.  This Sources Sought notice is being issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  The DOL is attempting to identify sources and features of commercially exposure matrices in Support of Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, possibly for four years.  A draft copy of the Statement of Work has been included  for information purposes only.  All information received in response to this notice will not be returned.  A response to this request may be submitted in any format, including standard marketing information.  Each company submitting information must include:  company name, point of contact, address, telephone number, e-mail address, capabilities statement, General Services Administration schedule information, business size, pricing, and any comments or suggestions.  Information is requested by  August 29, 2005 and can be submitted to the Department of Labor, Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Administration and Management, Attn:  Paula Miller-Sheelor, Contract Specialist, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room N-5416, Washington, DC 20210 or via e-mail to Sheelor.Paula@dol.gov.  Statement of Work for Exposure Matrices in Support of  Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program.  I.  Background:  Public Law 106-398, the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA) of 2000, as amended (the Act), established a program to compensate nuclear weapons program workers who suffered adverse health effects from exposure to beryllium, ionizing radiation, and other hazards in the course of their nuclear weapons program-related work.  The President, in an Executive Order dated December 7, 2000, assigned program implementation responsibilities to various executive departments.  The Fiscal Year 2005 National Defense Authorization Act, signed by President Bush on October 28, 2004, abolished Part D of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act administered by the Department of Energy (DOE) and replaced it with a new system of federal payments called Part E to be administered by the Department of Labor (DOL).

The Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation (DEEOIC) has responsibilities under Part E of the EEOICPA to issue decisions concerning whether certain employees of DOE contractors or subcontractors contracted occupational illnesses as a result of exposure to toxic substances in the work environment.  It is essential that DEEOIC have accurate, timely, and useful information regarding the toxic substances used at DOE sites throughout the United States.  The DEEOIC currently has records from DOE related to:  DOE Former Worker Programs (i.e. needs assessments), site reports (i.e. Tiger Team Reports, Environment Safety and Health reports, site history reports), operational safety procedures, environmental impact reports, job descriptions/labor categories, exposure assessment reports, accident investigation reports, field logs, emergency management plans, lists of chemicals utilized at the sites, industrial hygiene records and epidemiological studies. 

The challenges to developing useful data to identify exposures are considerable.  Many of the records do not exist or are not retrievable; some facilities no longer exist and the documentation has been archived; most sites had thousands of toxic substances present.  Data may be available from DOE Headquarters, DOE field sites, the Former Worker Program, as well as other locations.  Data sources may include industrial hygiene records, occupational medicine records, epidemiology data, personnel records, union records, etc.

The data currently maintained and the additional data that will be identified and obtained by the Contractor will be used by Claims Examiners to conduct research of DOE facilities and uranium mines and mills as an informational tool to assist with adjudication of claims under the Act.  This information will be used to validate information obtained from DOE or from the claimants.

The successful Contractor will have extensive institutional knowledge of the current and historical operations performed at the DOE facilities, uranium mines and mills, and be able to relate toxic exposures to this information.  The Contractor must have access or the ability to gain access to documents and/or data that identify the toxic substances used in specific sites.  This may include an established contractual relationship with subcontractors such as the Former Worker Program.  Some of this information may be classified and may include data covered under the Privacy Act.  The Contractor must have a security clearance with DOE or the ability to obtain a clearance.

II. SCOPE OF WORK 
The Contractor shall analyze and enhance the current data provided by DEEOIC.  The Contractor shall research additional sites, identify the data collection tools/locations, and provide recommendations to the DEEOIC as to which order the sites should be developed.  The DEEOIC will review and approve the order of research.  The contractor shall provide recommendations for records that should be utilized for the exposure matrices and develop the data input.

The Contractor shall research and identify occupations at covered DOE sites, building numbers where particular types of work was performed, and the toxic substances present at the sites.  The Contractor shall further identify the timeframes during which particular toxic substances were present and the diseases related to those toxic substances.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK FOR MICROWAVE PYRAMIDAL FLAME-RETARDANT ABSORBERS 
13 JULY 2005
1.0 SCOPE
The Electronic Warfare Directorate has a requirement to provide low frequency test capability in the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF).  This low frequency capability requires the installation of larger absorber in order to eliminate multi-path reflections back to the System Under Test (SUT).  The purchase of 72” absorber is needed to provide the necessary attenuation at these frequencies.
2.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS
IEEE STANDARD 1128 – “Recommended Practice for RF Absorber Performance Evaluation in the Range 30 MHz to 5Ghz”.

NRL Report 8093 – “Modified Smoldering Test of Urethane Foams Used in Anechoic Chambers”.  
3.0 REQUIREMENTS
3.1 Testing
Each piece of absorber shall be uniquely numbered and tested.  Low frequency testing can be performed done using a coaxial reflectometer according to IEEE Standard 1128.  The IEEE low frequency method requires absorber to be tested eight pieces at a time, which is acceptable to verify the low frequency performance.  The absorber must be tested from 80Mhz to 500Mhz and meet or exceed (more negative) the reflection values in the chart below: (See break points on table below.)










The break points are listed in the table below:

Frequency (MHz)	Reflections at Normal Incidence (dB)
80	-20
120	-30
200	-40
300	-40
500	-45

3.2 Manufacturing and Delivery Constraints
Each 2-ft by 2-ft absorber piece must be made out of a single piece of polyurethane foam. Due to the multiuse test nature of the BAF, glue lines would interfere with high frequency testing.  To ensure size and performance uniformity the polyurethane foam blocks must be carbon loaded prior to cutting.  Separately dipping the carbon loading from the fire retardant loading must be done to ensure more precise control of the carbon loading and hence the absorber’s final performance. 

The manufacturing and shipping of the absorber must be coordinated with the BAF test schedule.  At this point in time, delivery must be scheduled to begin during the week of 28 Nov – 2 Dec 2005.

The BAF does not have storage resources to store the large volume of absorber and would like to install the absorber over an approximate 1 to 2-week delivery schedule.  The manufacturer must have a sufficiently large production capacity and indoor storage to be able to deliver the entire order in as short as a 1 week window for timely deployment in the BAF.  The last delivery of the entire order cannot exceed 2 weeks from the first delivery.

3.3 Fire Retardant
Independently test the flammability of the absorber’s manufacturing method to meet the NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3).  

3.4 Physical Characteristics
Overall Height:	72 inches +/-0.5 inch
Overall Absorber Footprint:	24 inches square +/-0.125 inch
Pyramids per Piece:	1
Pyramid Shape:	Conventional microwave absorber
Base Height:	12 inches +/-0.25 inch
Pyramid Height:	60 inches +/-0.25 inch
Fire Retardant Loading:	1.1 lbs/ft(to the third power) +/-5%
Paint:	Light Blue
Installation Backing:	None
Carbon Compound Loading:	TBD* +/-5%
* Standard carbon loading is 1.1 lbs/ftto the third power, further modeling by the manufacturer may show that a lighter loading will give better performance in the BAF setup.  The manufacturer must be equipped to vary the loading of the absorber at the time of manufacturing with no additional cost.  Various carbon loadings may be specified by the government for different lots.  No more then 3 lots are anticipated for the total order.


3.4 Past Performance Requirements
Provide evidence of previous contract success in meeting identical or similar requirements:
•	RAM manufactured to specification (SOW Para 3.2)
•	Meeting flammability testing requirements IAW NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3) as spelled out in the BAF safety document (SOW Para 3.3)
•	Delivery similar quantity of RAM within the narrow time frame (SOW Para 3.2).

3.5 Program Management
The contractor shall notify the AFFTC Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) in a timely manner concerning any issues that would adversely impact the contractor’s ability to meet and satisfy the performance and schedule requirements of this SOW.

<SOLNBR>N0002405R6330
<RESPDATE>092005
<CONTACT>Jeff Beard, email Jeffrey.Beard@Navy.mil or phone 202-781-3834 M.L. McDaniel, fax number (202)781-4773 or e-mail address: mindy.mcdaniel@navy.mil.
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to award a contract in Fiscal Year 2006 to design and build a 21” diameter Mission Reconfigurable Unmanned Undersea Vehicle System (MRUUVS).  The MRUUVS, is planned to achieve initial operational capability in 2011, and is intended as a submarine (SSN688 and Virginia Class) operated system capable of meeting the Navy’s requirements for clandestine intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and limited ocean survey.  The system will be housed in the submarine’s torpedo room with launch and recovery through the submarine’s torpedo tubes.  The MRUUVS will be comprised of shipboard deployed equipment (SDE), a mission reconfigurable unmanned undersea vehicle (MRUUV), and non shipboard deployed equipment.  The SDE will include equipment to support launch and recovery of the MRUUV, equipment to conduct on board maintenance, and any additional equipment to support mission planning and post mission data analysis.  The MRUUV will!  consist of a basic vehicle and a separable mission payload.  The basic vehicle is defined as the propulsion, forward-looking sonar, energy, navigation, communications, electronics, guidance and control, and all associated autonomous control functions.  Major risk areas include integration with the SSN platform (integrating the SDE and MRUUV within the SSN), MRUUV recovery, energy, autonomy, and reliability.  Payloads are mission specific hardware, which when integrated into the basic vehicle allows the MRUUV to conduct the desired missions.  The MRUUVS will deliver with both a mine countermeasure payload, which includes synthetic aperture sonar, and an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance payload.    	In support of this procurement NAVSEA is seeking to engage industry to assist in reducing the program risk, and providing input on the final procurement package.  On January 26, 2005 NAVSEA released a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) soliciting new and innovative concepts in the development and demonstration of technologies applicable to UUVs.  The full BAA is available at http://www1.eps.gov/spg/DON/NAVSEA/NAVSEAHQ/N0002405R6309/listing.html.  NAVSEA continues to seek input through this BAA.  Additionally, NAVSEA is seeking expressions of interest to understand industry’s interests and ability to develop and integrate the MRUUVS.  Development of the MRUUVS will require a strong system integrator capable of leading and integrating the development of complex systems and subsystems into the SSN 668, SSN 668I, and SSN 774 class submarines.  Using sound system engineering principles the system integrator will identify required interfaces, identify appropriate systems and subsyst! ems, manage and mitigate required program risks, and faithfully integrate the appropriate government furnished equipment (GFE) and contractor furnished equipment (CFE).  GFE will include an advance forward-looking sonar.  Additionally, NAVSEA will provide government furnished information (GFI) to reduce technology risks relating to MRUUV recovery, autonomy, synthetic aperture sonar, and a high-density energy source.  NAVSEA will provide this information via a technology information center (TIC) discussed later in this announcement.   Companies interested in becoming the MRUUVS system integrator are invited to provide a ten (10) page (maximum) presentation explaining:  1) Past experience as a systems integrator and how this experience supports the MRUUVS development; 2) The proposed approach for integrating the entire system, including major interfaces, proposed systems and subsystem breakout; 3) How the company would address the above system requirements; 4) Any requested GFE/GFI; 5) Identified risks and proposed mitigations; and 6) A schedule to achieve the 2011 IOC.      Responses are required to include the firm name, mailing address, telephone and facsimile numbers, World Wide Web (Internet) presence (if any), and direct points of contact including e-mail addresses. Only written responses transmitted electronically, by mail or facsimile will be accepted.  The Government will not provide payment for any information provided in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government return any data provided.  All data will be for official Government use only. A list of interested parties will be compiled from the firms who respond to this announcement. Firms that wish to be included on the interested parties list must be able to, as a minimum, 1) access the World Wide Web; 2) send and receive unclassified e-mail; and 3) access, download and print pre-solicitation documents from Internet websites. Responses to this announcement should be received in this office NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM (EST) on 20 September 2005. Please direct all responses to attent! ion of M.L. McDaniel (SEA 02635, fax number (202)781-4773 or e-mail address: mindy.mcdaniel@navy.mil. This sources sought announcement is for informational and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a solicitation and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. All information will be considered. This is not an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quotations (RFQ) or a Request for Proposals (RFP). NAVSEA will also provide detailed program information during a one day meeting with industry.  The meeting will be held at the Kossiakoff Center at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory on September 1, 2005.  The purpose of this meeting is for NAVSEA to provide industry information on the MRUUVS requirements, concept of operation, government support risk reduction efforts, and acquisition strategy.  NAVSEA will also solicit industry feedback on these areas to assist in final preparation of the MRUUVS request for procurement.  This industry day is open to all interested companies with the appropriate security clearances (the meeting will be held at the secret level).  However attendance is limited to no more than two attendees from each company (or subsidiary).  Interested participants should contact Jeff Beard, email Jeffrey.Beard@Navy.mil or phone 202-781-3834 to request a reservation, and submit the appropriate security clearances information to the Johns!  Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory incoming visitor control via FAX at (240) 228-6400 identifying MRUUVS Industry Day attendance as purpose of visit.  Participants will be requested to provide $10.00 per person to cover the cost of lunch.      Finally, the Navy will establish and open a web based Technical Information Center (TIC) designed to provide both acquisition and technical information relating to the MRUUVS procurement.  This TIC will open on August 25, 2005.  The TIC will be available at the website http://www.nuwc.navy.mil/npt/mruuvs.  Access to the TIC may be restricted to certain parties because it contains technical data that may not be freely disseminated.  Additionally, for security reasons, the Navy will restrict access to selected information via a second layer TIC link through a password security process.  The process for requesting access to the second layer will be available on the open website.  Once the requests have been processed and accepted, the requesting company/individual will be issued a username and password to gain online TIC access.     The initial release will include historical UUV documentation intended to provide a better understanding to general UUV requirements.  Industry is requested to review these documents and forward questions or comments to the contracting officer.  The TIC will be updated periodically so all interested parties should regularly review the data on the TIC for updates   While the web based TIC will only contain unclassified information, some documents on the TIC will reference classified information.  Additionally, the final solicitation is anticipated to include classified information up to the secret level.  The unclassified TIC website will provide procedures for requesting access to any classified TIC information.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Office of Chief Information Officer (OCIO), Associate Chief Information Officer Telecommunications Services and Operations is issuing this Sources Sought Notice (SSN) as part of market research for a USDA integrated Information Technology (IT) and Telecommunications Managed Asset Repository System (MARS) to track, monitor, and report information on all IT assets within USDA.  In addition to the database elements, this solution must assess the security posture of all networked devices in real-time and react accordingly by engaging USDA security controls to quarantine and notify both USDA departmental personnel and the customer agency of any non-standard actions or conditions.  This activity must occur prior to accessing any USDA network assets.  USDA network assets will not be exposed to customer agency devices that introduce unacceptable risk to the department as a whole.  This solution will also remediate discovered risks where possible and apply appropriate patches/configuration changes to bring devices into compliance prior to allowing access to USDA network assets.

USDA desires a free and open discussion of all ideas and comments. All responses and information shall be in written format (MS-Word 2000, Version 9.0) and transmitted electronically to the contracting office listed in this sources sought. Comments and ideas are strongly encouraged from all sources currently operating under the General Services Administration Government –Wide Acquisition Contract(s). In addition to responses from industry, USDA encourages responses from other Federal agencies, State governments and from any source that have or plans to implement a similar system.

This SSN is for planning purposes only. The government will not be obligated to pay for this information. All vendors responding to this SSN must provide written information on their company’s ability to meet these requirements as described below.  USDA recognizes the likelihood that no single vendor can fully respond to this RFI without the inclusion of components from other vendors/providers.  Consequently, USDA requests that any references to processes/products not directly provided by the respondent be expressed in vendor-neutral terms and/or that all copyright and trademark rights be observed and declared. Telephonic inquires and responses will not be accepted.  This request in no way constitutes a request for products or services by USDA.  The results of this RFI may or may not result in any additional procurement.

USDA consists of 8 program mission areas, 29 agencies and 12 Staff offices. All program mission offices and staff offices are located in Washington, DC. USDA has approximately 14000 locations throughout the United States and Europe. There are several hundred thousand IT assets installed and operating in all these locations. The current IT environment employs a number of different solutions based on mission area as well as agency/organization based management systems.  USDA is seeking a consolidated solution for asset/system management that can be leveraged department wide.  Responses should include information on scalability, and capabilities to operate in a distributed, centralized, and multi-tiered environments.

USDA OCIO is exploring ways to implement a centralized integrated Managed Asset Repository System (MARS).  The purpose of the MARS will be to (1) monitor, track, and report the status of all IT assets on USDA networks, (2) assist USDA in management of network resources via Network Admission Control providing for near real-time security vulnerability reporting and remediation on all IT systems and networks, (3) ensure all IT assets are protected from intrusions and compromises. Through these discrete functions, MARS should provide the lowest overall total cost of ownership, and best in practice quality of service. 

In terms of functionality, USDA is seeking an integrated solution that will improve USDA’s ability to manage IT assets throughout their lifecycle.  This should include the ability to track an asset from initial acquisition through final disposal, understanding that an individual asset could see several deployments and transfers of agency ownership within this time frame. This system should combine existing data sources/functionality with new capabilities.  It should also provide a mechanism for consolidated reporting and analysis to enable an enterprise view of IT assets throughout USDA. This system should have the capability to determine the security health of internal and external USDA customer devices.  This system should provide for the subsequent routing/quarantine of those customer devices not meeting specific standards.  Also It should be flexible to meet requirements  for  different classes of internal and external customers (teleworkers, federal travelers, inside contractors, outside contractors, on-site employees, general public etc…). USDA will seek to leverage existing IT security investments within MARS.  A list of current USDA security/tracking systems is attached to assist in accomplishing this goal.
 
Requirements:

OCIO has identified 8 key areas where an integrated IT asset(s) management system could provide significant operational improvements. However, discussions/responses should not be limited to these key areas if the respondents perceive gaps in the USDA approach to overall security.  The goal is to protect USDA IT assets through the implementation of “Best Practices“ and the recognition that we will have to continue to address emerging threats.  These are high-level functional and technical requirements that should be tightly integrated into the final solution.  Wherever possible, USDA seeks enterprise wide solutions that will maximize USDA’s IT investment. Responses to these requirements should include specific details for each area and recommendations of additional requirements, if required.  

USDA is seeking a solution that will track all information necessary to provide oversight and administration of USDA’s systems.  The solution should not represent an operational or financial burden to USDA during its lifecycle.  USDA is seeking information on full lifecycle and administrative costing associated with a solution of this nature (implementation strategy and maintenance).


The requirements are; 

1.	Asset Security Management

USDA is seeking a solution that will track information regarding installed security management software (i.e. Anti-Virus, patch management, Vulnerability assessment, etc.).  Coupled with this requirement is the need to correlate between discovered security deficiencies and associated remediation strategies and the ability to automate the remediation of these deficiencies.

2.	IP Address Management,

USDA is seeking a solution that will track information associated with the Internet Protocol (IP) address assigned to USDA system(s)

IP Address, Machine Access Code (MAC) address, Physical Location, Point of Contact (POC), Primary/Secondary function, Agency ownership and System Configuration

3.	Software Configuration Management

USDA is seeking a solution that will track system configuration information during the full lifecycle of USDA systems; to include all installed software components present on the system (Operating Systems, application software, and communications software)

4.	Hardware Configuration Management System

USDA is seeking a solution that will track system configuration information during the full lifecycle of USDA systems, to include all installed hardware components present on the system (inventory of all hardware assets present),

5.	Network Admission Control

USDA is seeking a solution that will authenticate system configuration information during the initial connection to a USDA network.  This information will be utilized to determine if the system should be granted access to the network, placed in an isolated segment for remediation or to have its connection rejected.(agent-based client, Redefine DMZ requirements, firewall management, automated quarantine, and encryption management), 

6.	IT Cost Management

USDA is seeking a solution that will track IT investments during the full lifecycle of USDA systems, to include the ability to correlate between systems to reveal redundancy and potential cost savings. 

Monitor and audit software usage for license compliance, effectiveness and under use that will allow USDA to make the best use of its software investment.

Optimize asset deployment and increase asset utilization

Manage agreements with external and internal partners to increase the effectiveness of Service Level Agreements (SLA), contracts and acquisitions.

7.	User Configuration Management 

USDA is seeking a solution that will track user configurations on USDA systems.  This should include the ability to identify current and previous users of a specific system as well as report on improper user configuration (insufficient password, unused accounts, etc.) (Rule set management, and authentication management), 
 
8.	Device/System Security History

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 10,001(a) (2) the Social Security Administration is conduction market research before developing requirements for possible acquisition of lightweight high resolution electronic displays capable of functioning as cordless electronic readers for electronically stored text and images.  The reader or device must be capable of working with standard browsers and or SSA supplied software.  Specifically, SSA is interested in the feasibility of utilizing the emerging new technology supporting electronic paper or e-paper for a targeted business application.  SSA wishes to determine if commercial items exist that could meet its needs or could be modified to meet its needs.  The SSA is in the process of converting a paper based-benefit claims folder to an electronic folder system.  The electronic folder will consist of, among others, standard format electronic documents created and saved in Microsoft Word and TIF format.  In the event of an appeal, the records within the claim folder must be made available to the claimant and their representative for review before or during a hearing.  Current plans are to make the electronic folder available to the claimant and representative on a CD-ROM.  The CD-ROM will work with a standard web browser and one of several standard TIF viewers. It requires the user to have a computer and sufficient knowledge of a computer to read the contents of the CD-ROM. There are points within the appeals process where users have sufficient familiarity with a computer to work unassisted.  In remote areas, on-site assistance may not be available.  A portable electronic display for the claims folder which requires no local network or computer and does not require computer skills to operate could save the infrastructure costs of computers, networking, additional space and contractors/employees needed to operate with the CD-ROMs.  SSA envisions this being a re-loadable reader or device with only simple navigation mechanism such as a touch screen working off of an exhibit list and a page-up/page-down function with government supplied electronic folder viewing software.  It would also need to be able to interact, to some extent, with SSA systems supporting this activity.  If any such portable readers or devices exist and could be adapted to meet the needs specified, SSA would be interested in testing them in up to seven (7) locations.  The specific requirements include:  (1). Display should approximate 8 1/2 X 11 inch paper format.  (2). Ability to display 2 pages on open book format. (3). Ability to work with software to display documents in Microsoft Word and formats used by SSA.  (4). Ability to work with SSA supplied navigation software to navigate quickly among large multiple page documents using a supplied document (exhibit) list with touch screen or similar function and page-up/page down keys.  (5). Ability to remove one folder and load another quickly and without access to network.  (6). Lighter than an ordinary laptop computer. (7). Does not require computer skills to operate. (8). Folders are read-only once downloaded.  SSA is requesting contractors that have a product capable of meeting the above requirements to submit complete details of the product and indicate if they are available on Federal Supply Schedule, to the above address within fifteen calendar days from the date of publication of this announcement.  No cost or pricing data is required or requested.  This is an information gathering effort only and if further procurement action is taken additional publication will be done as required.  This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted.  Respondents will not be notified of any evaluated results from the data received.  No contract award will be made on the basis or responses received; however, this information will be used in SSA’s assessment of capable sources.  Electronic responses only must be submitted by August 18th, 2005.  Faxed information will not be permitted.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.  NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME.  The size limitation for email attachments is five (5) megabytes.  MS Word 2002 is the standard word processing software.  Respondents should refer to SSA-RFI-05-9980.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY TACOM invites your response to the below market survey questionnaire for procuring Recapitalization services for M870, M870A1, M870A2 Lowboy, M871, M871A1 and M871A2 22.5 Ton Capacity Flat Bed and M872, M872A1, M872A2, 34 Ton Capacity, Flatbed Semi-trailer s.   This market survey questionnaire seeks information from potential suppliers regarding the Governments plans to contract for Semitrailer overhaul and upgrade services. The term applied to this effort is referred to as Recapitalization which is a managed pr ocess consisting of semi-trailer disassembly, overhaul of major structures, and a focused rebuild and assembly process that includes the installation of new equipment that improves vehicle performance and increases its longevity.  Intent: It is the intent of TACOM on behalf of the Army to award an Indefinite Quantity, Indefinite Delivery contract for the Recapitalization of each of the commercially based semi-trailers listed above. The three trailers are being combined for recapital ization into one contracted effort to meet the fluctuating needs of U.S. Army, Army National Guard and Army Reserve units who have received and are maintaining some or all of the models listed. Combination also provides the possibility of stabilizing reman ufacturing processes at a manufacturing plant once production begins.     Description of Systems: The M870 is a 40 ton capacity, 40 foot long, Low-boy Semitrailer capable of transporting construction and material handling equipment, it has a folding gooseneck that doubles as a ramp and has a mission profile that requires its bei ng capable of 50% on-road and off-road transportation while fully loaded.  The M871 Semitrailer is a 22.5 ton capacity, 40 foot long by 8 foot wide, dual purpose, break bulk/container transporter, with a flatbed. Its' mission is line and local haul of break bulk cargo and inter-modal cargo containers.  The M872 Semitrailer is a 34 ton capacity, 40 foot long by 8 foot wide, Semitrailer it is also a dual purpose, break bulk/container transporter, with a flatbed. Its' mission is line and local haul of break bulk cargo, Inter-modal Cargo containers, M113 Arm ored Personnel Carriers and personnel shelters.  The M871 and M872 are based on commercial platform style, dual-purpose semi-trailers. The recapitalized semi-trailers will be capable of daily operating ranges of 300 miles at sustained speeds up to 65 mph.   Unique military characteristics on all Recapitalized Army assets will include: Green, Camouflage, or Tan Chemical Agent Resistant Coating (CARC), Military lift and tie down provisions in accordance with MIL-STD 209J, a 12/24-volt lighting system with Black out lights and an Anti-lock Brake System. The required semi-trailers must be re-built to meet severe duty operation that includes movement off-road when coupled with a commercially based line haul tractor. All of the semi-trailers are required to have the ability to be loaded and offloaded to C141, C-5 and C-17 Aircraft, and meet all applicable NATO inter-operability criteria.  Semitrailers must have sufficient ground clearance to load and offload at a 15-degree pitch angle in order to roll-on and roll-off shipping vessel loading ramps. Recapitalized Semitrailers are to be equipped with the following.  24-Volt Anti-Lock Braking System with PLC, Radial Tires, bolt-on upper coupler plates where applicable, 12 and 24-volt electrical receptacles, LED lighting, a  spare tire carrier, and a side panel kits where applicable with onboard stowage that will protect and contain the side panels when stored.  The M871RECAPSOW is an example of a Scope of Work that would become an enforceable section of a proposed future contract for M800 Series Semitrailer recapitalization. The file is to afford the opportunity to gain an understanding of the work that will be r equired to recapitalize existing semi-trailer assets. The file is to be considered a draft document for the use of evaluat ion. If you would like a copy of M871RECAPSOW, please email your request to Pat Macheske at Macheskp@tacom.army.mil.  Schedule: The intent is to award a Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type production contract to acquire an estimated 2400 units with additional estimated requirements of 2400 units over the remainder of the contract period. All production quantities  are estimated based on available trailer fleet assets and are subject to change.  Two each test units for each model will be required for testing. The schedule for test unit delivery will be decided upon based on the availability of assets and relative im portance of field needs. Assume a delivery schedule that delivers Recapitalized Flat-bed trailers within 90 days of contract award and Low-boy trailers within 120 days of contract award.  Government testing will be performed to confirm structural integrity  and durability.  Testing is estimated to take a minimum of 180 days.  Trailers that pass test requirements will be re-furbished and used as production baseline models.  If proposed, contractor test costs may include transportation of equipment and the furnishing of onsite Field Service personnel to support testing.

In order to achieve the quality, flexibility, adaptability, and sustainability, as well as time and cost savings that the Government is wanting to achieve, industry told USACE that it wi ll have to open up its MILCON Program to multiple different types of construction methods that are available and utilized throughout the United States by private industry.  Industry recommended that USACE utilize industry best practices, standards and code s.  Industry recommended that the Government utilize performance based type contracts versus its current prescriptive contracts that identify exactly what materials will be used, how the facility is to be constructed, and when each phase of the constructio n will be completed.  Industry stated that non-traditional construction methods such as Pre-Fabricated, Pre-Engineered, Panelized or Tilt-up Walls, and Permanent Modular Construction methods are solutions that the Government should seriously consider in or der to meet the needs of the Army.   Industry also stated that it could achieve cost savings through bulk buys if awarded more than one of the same type of facility.   Based on this national market research, the Southwestern Division Corps of Engineers has developed an execution model that it believes will achieve the cost savings and time efficiency sought by the Army, achieve economies of scale and also provide multipl e opportunities for small business participation.   Instead of executing large construction contracts for each Brigade, our execution model provides for a Land Development Engineering firm to design the overall infrastructure and serve in a site integrator role; and for the facility types to be executed und er separate single and/or multiple award IDIQ design build contracts in what is referred to as product lines.  In order to explain this approach, the Government will hold an Industry Day Forum in El Paso.  This Industry Day, in addition to the market resea rch questionnaire, is necessary in order for the Government to determine whether or not the market has the capability and capacity to execute this potentially multi-billion dollar program over the next five years.  In order to facilitate Industry understan ding of this approach prior to the Industry Day, the Southwestern Division has placed a MS power point presentation on the Fort Worth District Contracting Divisions home page http://ebs.swf.usace.army.mil .

<DESC>Point of Contact: Email your questions to US Army Engineer District, Fort Worth at Lisa.C.Billman@swf02.usace.army.mil  Re:  MILCON TRANSFORMATION PROGRAM INFORMATION FOR FT. BLISS, TX:  Over the past few months, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE ) has conducted national market research by holding nationwide Industry Forums to seek Industry capability and input into how to execute a multi-billion dollar program across the United States.  In order to achieve the quality, flexibility, adaptability, a nd sustainability, as well as time and cost savings that the Government is wanting to achieve, industry told USACE that it will have to open up its MILCON Program to multiple different types of construction methods that are available and utilized throughou t the United States by private industry.  Industry recommended that USACE utilize industry best practices, standards and codes.  Industry recommended that the Government utilize performance based type contracts versus its current prescriptive contracts tha t identify exactly what materials will be used, how the facility is to be constructed, and when each phase of the construction will be completed.  Industry stated that non-traditional construction methods such as Pre-Fabricated, Pre-Engineered, Panelized o r Tilt-up Walls, and Permanent Modular Construction methods are solutions that the Government should seriously consider in order to meet the needs of the Army.   Industry also stated that it could achieve cost savings through bulk buys if awarded more than  one of the same type of facility.  Based on this national market research, the Southwestern Division Corps of Engineers has developed an execution model that it believes will achieve the cost savings and time efficiency sought by the Army, achieve economi es of scale and also provide multiple opportunities for small business participation.  Instead of executing large construction contracts for each Brigade, our execution model provides for a Land Development Engineering firm to design the overall infrastruc ture and serve in a site integrator role; and for the facility types to be executed under separate single and/or multiple award IDIQ design build contracts in what is referred to as product lines.  In order to explain this approach, the Government will hol d an Industry Day Forum in El Paso.  This Industry Day, in addition to the market research questionnaire, is necessary in order for the Government to determine whether or not the market has the capability and capacity to execute this potentially multi-bill ion dollar program over the next five years.  In order to facilitate Industry understanding of this approach prior to the Industry Day, the Southwestern Division has placed a MS power point presentation on the Fort Worth District Contracting Divisions hom e page http://ebs.swf.usace.army.mil .  Additionally, the Southwestern Division requests that you complete the questionnaire (also found on this website) and provide your responses to the below POC by close of business August 5, 2005.

Bliss.  All buildings are to be considered permanent and shall have a life span of approximately 25 years. THIS PROGRAM IS NOT RESTRICTED AND IS OPEN TO BOTH LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION UNDER  NAICS CODES 236  Construction of Buildings (236116, 117, 118, 210, 220); 237  Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction (237110, 120, 130, 210); 238  Specialty Trade Contractors (238110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 190, 210, 220, 290, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, 390, 910, 990); 541  Professional and Technical Services (541310, 320, 330, 410, 490).  This announcement is being broadcasted to several of the above NAI CS codes to ensure that it has the widest dissemination as possible.

<DESC>MILCON TRANSFORMATION PROGRAM INFORMATION FOR FT. BLISS, TX:  Over the past few months, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has conducted national market research by holding nationwide Industry Forums to seek Industry capability and input into how  to execute a multi-billion dollar program across the United States.  In order to achieve the quality, flexibility, adaptability, and sustainability, as well as time and cost savings that the Government is wanting to achieve, industry told USACE that it wi ll have to open up its MILCON Program to multiple different types of construction methods that are available and utilized throughout the United States by private industry.  Industry recommended that USACE utilize industry best practices, standards and code s.  Industry recommended that the Government utilize performance based type contracts versus its current prescriptive contracts that identify exactly what materials will be used, how the facility is to be constructed, and when each phase of the constructio n will be completed.  Industry stated that non-traditional construction methods such as Pre-Fabricated, Pre-Engineered, Panelized or Tilt-up Walls, and Permanent Modular Construction methods are solutions that the Government should seriously consider in or der to meet the needs of the Army.   Industry also stated that it could achieve cost savings through bulk buys if awarded more than one of the same type of facility.   Based on this national market research, the Southwestern Division Corps of Engineers has developed an execution model that it believes will achieve the cost savings and time efficiency sought by the Army, achieve economies of scale and also provide multipl e opportunities for small business participation.   Instead of executing large construction contracts for each Brigade, our execution model provides for a Land Development Engineering firm to design the overall infrastructure and serve in a site integrator role; and for the facility types to be executed und er separate single and/or multiple award IDIQ design build contracts in what is referred to as product lines.  In order to explain this approach, the Government will hold an Industry Day Forum in El Paso.  This Industry Day, in addition to the market resea rch questionnaire, is necessary in order for the Government to determine whether or not the market has the capability and capacity to execute this potentially multi-billion dollar program over the next five years.  In order to facilitate Industry understan ding of this approach prior to the Industry Day, the Southwestern Division has placed a MS power point presentation on the Fort Worth District Contracting Divisions home page http://ebs.swf.usace.army.mil .  Additionally, the Southwestern Division request s that you complete the questionnaire (also found on this website) and provide your responses to the below POC by close of business August 5, 2005.   INPUT IS DESIRED FROM ALL INTERESTED PARTIES.  THIS INCLUDES CONTRACTORS, INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS, ASSOCIAT IONS OR SOCIETIES.

Industry stated that non-traditional con struction methods such as Pre-Fabricated, Pre-Engineered, Panelized or Tilt-up Walls, and Permanent Modular Construction methods are solutions that the Government should seriously consider in order to meet the needs of the Army.   Industry also stated that  it could achieve cost savings through bulk buys if awarded more than one of the same type of facility.   Based on this national market research, the Southwestern Division Corps of Engineers has developed an execution model that it believes will achieve the cost savings and time efficiency sought by the Army, achieve economies of scale and also provide multipl e opportunities for small business participation.   Instead of executing large construction contracts for each Brigade, our execution model provides for a Land Development Engineering firm to design the overall infrastructure and serve in a site integrator role; and for the facility types to be executed und er separate single and/or multiple award IDIQ design build contracts in what is referred to as product lines.  In order to explain this approach, the Government will hold an Industry Day Forum in El Paso.  This Industry Day, in addition to the market resea rch questionnaire, is necessary in order for the Government to determine whether or not the market has the capability and capacity to execute this potentially multi-billion dollar program over the next five years.  In order to facilitate Industry understan ding of this approach prior to the Industry Day, the Southwestern Division has placed a MS power point presentation on the Fort Worth District Contracting Divisions home page http://ebs.swf.usace.army.mil .

BLISS, TX:  Over the past few months, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has conducted national market research by holding nationwide Industry Forums to seek Industry capability and input into how  to execute a multi-billion dollar program across the United States.  In order to achieve the quality, flexibility, adaptability, and sustainability, as well as time and cost savings that the Government is wanting to achieve, industry told USACE that it wi ll have to open up its MILCON Program to multiple different types of construction methods that are available and utilized throughout the United States by private industry.

<DESC>MILCON TRANSFORMATION PROGRAM INFORMATION FOR FT. BLISS, TX:  Over the past few months, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has conducted national market research by holding nationwide Industry Forums to seek Industry capability and input into how  to execute a multi-billion dollar program across the United States.  In order to achieve the quality, flexibility, adaptability, and sustainability, as well as time and cost savings that the Government is wanting to achieve, industry told USACE that it wi ll have to open up its MILCON Program to multiple different types of construction methods that are available and utilized throughout the United States by private industry.  Industry recommended that USACE utilize industry best practices, standards and code s.  Industry recommended that the Government utilize performance based type contracts versus its current prescriptive contracts that identify exactly what materials will be used, how the facility is to be constructed, and when each phase of the constructio n will be completed.  Industry stated that non-traditional construction methods such as Pre-Fabricated, Pre-Engineered, Panelized or Tilt-up Walls, and Permanent Modular Construction methods are solutions that the Government should seriously consider in or der to meet the needs of the Army.   Industry also stated that it could achieve cost savings through bulk buys if awarded more than one of the same type of facility.   Based on this national market research, the Southwestern Division Corps of Engineers has developed an execution model that it believes will achieve the cost savings and time efficiency sought by the Army, achieve economies of scale and also provide multipl e opportunities for small business participation.   Instead of executing large construction contracts for each Brigade, our execution model provides for a Land Development Engineering firm to design the overall infrastructure and serve in a site integrator role; and for the facility types to be executed und er separate single and/or multiple award IDIQ design build contracts in what is referred to as product lines.  In order to explain this approach, the Government will hold an Industry Day Forum in El Paso.  This Industry Day, in addition to the market resea rch questionnaire, is necessary in order for the Government to determine whether or not the market has the capability and capacity to execute this potentially multi-billion dollar program over the next five years.  In order to facilitate Industry understan ding of this approach prior to the Industry Day, the Southwestern Division has placed a MS power point presentation on the Fort Worth District Contracting Divisions home page http://ebs.swf.usace.army.mil .  Additionally, the Southwestern Division request s that you complete the questionnaire (also found on this website) and provide your responses to the below POC by close of business August 5, 2005.

<SUBJECT>--Install Vindicator Annunciator as the single Intrusion Detection System (IDS) annunciator platform for all PACAF Installations
<DESC>Since the terrorist attacks on 11 Sep 01, operational requirements for Command and Control Infrastructure have grown by leaps and bounds. The communications community has seen a tremendous surge in the number of Users requiring access to classified n etworks and classified systems, including the Global Command and Control System (GCCS), which supports various operations for Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). The growth of these classified infrastructure requirements forced the need for new and revised r e gulations/instructions pertaining to physical security and the safeguarding of information. As a result, PACAF/SC (Communication & Information) has begun to install physical intrusion detection systems (IDS) to support the physical security component of it s classified systems. In conjunction with the increased requirements for IDS, PACAF/SF (Security Force) has partnered with PACAF/SC in a joint initiative to standardize the IDS across the PACAF AOR. This joint effort includes the installation of a new annu nciator at the Security Forces Control Center at all PACAF Installations. PACAF/SC is installing the Vindicator annunciator systems as part of its C2 modernization project to achieve PACAFs goal of standardization on a single annunciator platform. C urren tly, Hickam AFB has completed the installation of the Vindicator annunciator panel at its Security Forces Control Center. Current and future projects being constructed under the AF MILCON program will have to comply with this requirement and provide the Vi ndicator system for the IDS.

(3) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection. 		(4) A summary of the rationale for award. 		(5) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. 		(6) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency. 					(End of provision) 52.212-2   	EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS  (JAN 1999) (a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each Offeror's submission is evaluated according to the factors shown below.  Factors A, B, and C are roughly equal to each other; factor D is less important.    A)	Compliance with solicitation requirement (Emulex Part Number considered) B)	Product Availability  C)	Delivery Schedule (August 3, 2005) D)	Price Contract award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer, in conforming to this RFQ, provides an overall best value to the Government, technical evaluation factors, and cost considered.  The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable cost.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than cost; however, between offers that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, cost will become a major consideration in selecting the successful Offeror. 	(b) Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 	(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.             			                      (End of provision) BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION Please complete and return immediately to:  judy.grant@mms.gov Agency/Office Name: ___Executive Office of the President___________________________________________________________ 1.	"Brand name" of product: ______Emulex  ________________________________________________ 2.	Description of "brand name" product: ___FC PCI/PCI-X HBA 33/66/100/133 MHz __________________________________________ 3.	Name of manufacturer of "brand name" product:  LP9802-E and DC10000-E  __________________________________ 4.	The "brand name" provided is to identify the standard of quality necessary. Equivalents will be considered.	____	Yes	__x__	No (If no, please complete Nos. 5 and 6.) 5.	If the answer to No. 4 is "no," please complete the following.  Only the "brand name" item specified will meet the Government's needs: _____ A.	Because patent rights, copyrights, proprietary secret processes, control of certain materials or components providing a superior utility or capability that cannot be obtained from similar products. __x___ B. 	Because program requirements cannot be modified so that competitive products or services may be used. 	_____ C.	Because the product or service is unique and easily established as one-of-a kind.	   	Please explain: 6.	If the answer to No. 4 is "no," please indicate other reasons for restricting competition: The Executive Office of the President has an infrastructure requirement to upgrade and replace Emulex  LP9802-E HBA's ( Host Bus Adapters) and DC10000-E HBA ( Host Bus Adapter)   The Emulex drivers are deeply embedded into the EOP Infrastructure. Switching to another product line would cause long outages to EOP's servers as EOP's servers are standardized and imaged . The EOP requires the ability to quickly replace a faulty HBA without having addition software installation that could have a direct effect on performance, redundancy, and down time. In addition if other brands of HBAs are introduced, they will have to undergo a testing and validation process that EOP is currently not equipped to handle, especially given our aggressive timelines for implementation. I certify to the best of my knowledge that the above statements are correct. __Stephen S.

Use brand name or equal descriptions when the salient characteristics are firm requirements.  *11.105 Items peculiar to one manufacturer.  Agency requirements shall not be written so as to require a particular brand name, product, or a feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company, unless-  (a) The particular brand name, product, or feature is essential to the Government's requirements, and market research indicates other companies' similar products, or products lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency's needs;  (b) The authority to contract without providing for full and open competition is supported by the required justifications and approvals (see 6.302-1); and  (c) The basis for not providing for maximum practicable competition is documented in the file when the acquisition is awarded using simplified acquisition procedures.  *6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

I. Scope of Work

Background

Strong financial systems and institutions are key to the long-term economic growth and stability of the economies in transition in Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union.  The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), through its Bureau for Europe and Eurasia (E&E) has given high priority to assisting the systemic reform of the financial sector and the development of sound, competitive, market-oriented financial institutions. A hallmark of E&E technical assistance programs has been the focus on the establishment of an appropriate legal and regulatory framework for the financial sector, and the creation of key financial regulatory authorities, and associations of financial sector participants.  USAID has placed emphasis on the establishment and implementation of prudential regulations and legal framework based on international standards and best practices, which provides the incentive for commercially based financial intermediation, the prudential supervision of financial institutions, bank privatization and restructuring, building human capacity, the adoption of international accounting standards, and the disclosure of information on a regular and timely basis. 

As the key public and private financial institutions have been established and gained viability, and the basic building blocks of the legal/regulatory framework are put in place in the E&E region, there has been increasing emphasis over the last several years on deepening and broadening financial markets and increasing access to credit, particularly for households and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), developing mortgage finance, promoting financial sector integration based on international standards, and anti-money laundering and terrorist finance.

During transition to a market economy, USAID programs have recognized that the most difficult task is not the adoption of laws and regulations nor the policy prescription but rather the implementation of laws and policies which requires the establishment and/or strengthening of effective institutions and appropriately educated and trained staff. 
  
The financial sector work remains a centerpiece of USAID economic growth activities in the region. The work is challenging and requires staff that has knowledge and experience with the wide range of issues that effect financial sector development in transition economies, including: the macroeconomic context, the legal/regulatory framework underpinning banking and capital markets; financial sector supervision; and governance issues.

SOLICITATION NUMBER: M/OAA/GRO/EGAS-05-1818
ISSUANCE DATE: July 28, 2005
CLOSING DATE/TIME: August 27, 2005, 15:00 Local time, Washington, D.C.
POSITION TITLE:  Senior Rule of Law Advisor
MARKET VALUE:  $74,782 - $114,882
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Two Years
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Washington, D.C.
SECURITY ACCESS:  Secret
AREA OF CONSIDERATION: U.S. Citizens Only

I. Scope of Work

Background

Respect for the rule of law and a well-developed justice system are underpinnings of a democratic society and a modern economy. Effective rule of law resolves conflicts and fosters social interaction in accord with legal norms and widely accepted societal values. It also enhances predictability, equitable treatment, and a respect for basic human rights; provides services in accord with societal demand and expectations; and helps curb the arbitrary exercise and abuse of power by other branches of government, elites, and other privileged groups. In all these regards, justice sector institutions must perform their functions effectively. At the same time their operations must be transparent, accountable, and in compliance with the law.

In many states with weak or incipient democratic traditions and underdeveloped economies, the processes and institutions which are necessary to uphold the rule of law are incompletely evolved and ineffective. Often, their legal framework does not correspond to social reality and contemporary needs. Customary and informal practice may cause further deviations, so that legally established rights are not recognized, inequitable treatment is the "rule," and actions and decisions respond to partisan, particularistic, or pecuniary interests. The lesser relevance of formal law and institutions is often accompanied by the limited availability of justice sector services so that large masses of the population must rely on unofficially recognized alternative mechanisms which often have their own non-democratic biases. When these conditions prevail, the rule of law, democratic reform, and sustainable economic development are all very difficult to advance. 

Just as there are many ways of defining rule of law sector elements and problems, there are also numerous ways of developing rule of law programs. USAID supports but is not limited to work in rule of law in three primary areas: 
•	Improving outdated or otherwise inadequate legal frameworks and codifying human rights. 
•	Strengthening justice-sector institutions and working toward independence of the judiciary. 
•	Increasing citizens' access to justice.

Objective

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Bureau for Europe and Eurasia (E&E), Office of Democracy, Governance and Social Transition, is seeking to hire under a Personal Services Contract (PSC) a qualified individual to fill the position of Senior Rule of Law Advisor.  Under the direction of the Team Chief of the Democracy and Governance Team and/or her designee, the Advisor will provide substantive analytical and technical expertise in the area of rule of law. The work will support the Bureaus’ objective of helping to establish full democracies rooted in the rule of law.

Duties and Responsibilities

The Advisor will serve in the Democracy Governance and Social Transition office as a member of the Democracy and Governance team.  The advisor will be responsible for provision of technical advice on a region-wide (26 countries in the Europe and Eurasia region) assistance portfolio of legal reform activities, including activities designed to improve the independence of the judiciary, protect human, rights, reduce corruption, reform criminal justice systems, improve parliaments and support post-war reconstruction and peace accord implementation (e.g. Kosovo). This includes, but is not limited to, consultations on cooperative agreements with the American Bar Association, and grants or contracts with other organizations implementing USAID assistance. It also includes full-service support to USAID missions in the region, including performing sector assessments, evaluations, project designs, inter-agency fact-finding missions, and participating in international conferences. 

The incumbent will serve as an advisor to the E&E Bureau in developing and analyzing strategies to support rule of law reform, assessing progress and constraints to rule of law progress in the E&E region, and identifying and responding to new rule of law development challenges in the E&E region as they emerge. 

The incumbent also plays a critical role in defining and formulating the content of USAID’s assistance in E&E countries such that it complements programs implemented by other USG departments, including the Department of Justice and the Department of State/International Narcotics and Law Enforcement.  S/He represents the E&E Bureau in discussions regarding USAID/E&E rule of law assistance programs with the Office of the Assistance Coordinator for Europe & Eurasia at the Department of State.   S/He serves as an interlocutor among the E&E Bureau, the DCHA Bureau, State Department, and the Department of Justice regarding USAID’s assistance for two high USG priorities for the region:  criminal justice and security sector reform, and combating corruption.  The Senior Rule of Law Advisor is essential for the Agency to fully engage with other USG counterparts in these two topics.

The Advisor will be based at USAID in Washington, DC and will:

•	Assist USAID missions to formulate rule of law strategies for individual countries; reviewing strategies submitted as part of results frameworks; directing rule of law assessments; directing rule of law contract and/or grant evaluations; reviewing unsolicited proposals; responding to Congressional inquiries.

•	Design new project components and activities to be implemented by the institutional contractors or to be bid for new contractors and/or grantees. This includes preparing scopes of work, requests for proposals/applications, Acquisition and Assistance requests, decision memos, Congressional Notifications, inter-agency agreement letters, etc.

•	Perform directed travel within the E&E region to provide hands-on consultations, strategy formulation, assessments, and monitoring of on-going Rule of Law activities.

•	Serve as a senior advisor to the Europe and Eurasia Bureau with regard to the status of all justice sector reform in the E&E region, including activities of other USG agencies, host governments, other donors and non-governmental organizations.  With an in-depth knowledge of USAID's rule of law programs across the region, represent the Agency in inter-agency and international forums with regard to such issues as justice sector reconstruction, human rights, police and security sector reform, transitional justice, war crimes, anti-corruption and other topics as they relate to USAID's current or potential rule of law programming.

•	Provide briefings to U.S. and foreign officials, Congress, and other donors on USAID programming in the region.  Facilitate visits by foreign officials and delegations to USAID.  

•	Act as Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) for assigned contracts and grants, including day-to-day responsibility for monitoring implementation of activities, tracking financial issues, processing obligation actions and other requests to OP under the contracts/grants, and responding to requests. Management will provide a CTO training opportunity.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for a customer relationship management (CRM) tool according to the specifications outlined below. The resulting order from this solicitation will be Firm Fixed Price. A. BACKGROUND SUMMARY NASA Ames Research Center has a need to acquire a web-accessible relational-database based software that will track information from the customer development through to proposal submission.  In order to effectively manage the complex information, NASA Ames Research Center needs a CRM application that can be easily and cost effectively adapted to the science and technology environment. The type of business development information to manage at NASA Ames Research Center is different enough from industry that commercial off-the-shelf software will likely need to be customized.	NASA Ames Research Center is a federal facility and conducts R&D in a variety of science and technology areas and has a wide-range of customers (e.g., NASA, DOD, DOT, universities, industry).  Because of budgetary constraints, costs to customize must be reasonable. The CRM would initially be provided to and utilized by a subset of the Ames New Business Office staff and select others (~10 users).  After a satisfactory testing period and identification of additional users, the CRM user community would likely expand to approximately 50 users. B. SPECIFICATIONS Specifications below must exist currently or be made available via customizations. 1. Hosting, Hardware and Administration A solution must: host on-site at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA; host on existing Macintosh hardware; be viewable via a web browser (non-client) for access by Mac and PC users; provide NASA with source code to make modest customizations if necessary; have build-in administrative tools to allow for customizations to the front-end (the fields and drop-down lists without going to the backend coding); not require specialized database administrator training to maintain.  2. Permissions and Security A solution must: allow for access-level security permissions for end-users; be able to meet NASA security standards. 3. User Interface A solution must:  use terminology that is commonly understood; have navigation that is clear with minimal clicks to get to the information needed; not require technical training to learn how to use. 4. Functionality A solution must provide: customizable reporting; uploading and downloading via Excel or tab-delimitated file; uploading of attachments; good searching capability; calendaring/scheduling; e-mail archiving. 5. Content Management A solution must be able to manage: contacts info; customer/account info; new business opportunity info; business proposal info including the financial data across fiscal years.  6. Licenses and Maintenance  A solution must provide: helpdesk support to end-users and on-site administrators during West Coast business hours; provide patches and updates as necessary via annual license fees; provide guidance on setting up the hardware and software in the Ames environment.  Must have the capability to work with NASA Ames Research Center to make future customizations, as necessary. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 2005-04.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-04.  The Solicitation number is SB1341-05-Q-0875. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 325998 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This procurement is being competed on an unrestricted basis.

****The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has a requirement for one (1) Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite Neutron Filter for MACS Incident Beam.  See attached drawing (038-0075 Rev 3.pdf) at ftp://ftp.ncnr.nist.gov/pub/incoming.
Background
This procurement is to acquire Pyrolytic Graphite that will be used by NIST to reject unwanted high energy neutrons from the MACS neutron scattering spectrometer at the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). The full width at half maximum mosaic distribution width shall be less than 8 degrees (as measured with 11.6 meV neutrons). Due to the crystalline structure of the material and the coherent nature of interactions between neutrons and carbon, neutrons with wave lengths greater than 0.23 nm will pass through this material along its crystalline c-axis with a low probability for scattering and absorption. However, shorter wavelength neutrons will generally be strongly scattered and hence rejected from the instrument as desired. 
Scope
The procurement is for a large right circular truncated conical block of oriented pyrolytic graphite to filter the beam that emanates from the NCNR cold neutron source before it reaches the MACS monochromating system. The required physical dimensions and tolerances are provided in drawing 038-0075 rev 3.
Contractor Requirements
The Contractor shall ship a first article sample plus the post-sample production lot of specified chemical purity, density, and mosaic distribution to the technical information contact (TIC). The first article sample shall be provided following award of the purchase order. The post-sample production lot shall be provided only after the Contracting Officer notification to the Contractor in accordance with Clause 52.209-4 Alt I. 

The contract line items for this request for quotation are as follows:

LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity:  One (1) Unit Each – Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite Neutron Filter for MACS Incident Beam First Article Sample that meets or exceeds the following specifications:  
First Article Sample 
The Contractor shall provide a materials first article sample that is representative of the filter material to be delivered so that compliance with specifications can be verified. The first article sample, which can itself be a laminated structure, shall have a thickness along the c-direction of 50 mm. The dimensions in both orthogonal directions perpendicular to the c-axis shall be between 20 mm and 50 mm. The first article sample shall be provided within 1 month after Contractor acceptance of the purchase order. If the sample is deemed not to meet specifications, the Contractor must submit a subsequent sample within one month of receiving written comments from the Contracting Officer regarding the deficiencies in the first sample.

LINE ITEM 0002: Quantity:  One (1) Unit Each – Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite Neutron Filter for MACS Incident Beam Post-Sample Production that meets or exceeds the following specifications:  

Post-Sample Production Requirements 
Chemical composition and Density: This specification ensures sufficient content of the desired oriented graphite majority phase. 
-	Carbon as Pyrolytic Graphite >99% by weight
-	The overall density of each the filter (taking the volume to be that defined by the corresponding drawings) shall exceed 95% of the room temperature density of Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite, which is 2.26g/cm3.
Mosaic distribution: This specification is set to maximize transmission in the 0.23 nm to 0.4 nm wave length range and to maximize efficiency as a filter for higher order neutrons. 
-	The average c-axis direction for the filter shall be parallel to the high symmetry axis (the beam direction) to within 1o. 
-	The average Full Width at Half Maximum Mosaic width for the filter as measured with 11.6 meV neutrons shall not exceed 8o. 
Neutron transmission specification: This specification ensures adequate neutron transmission in the operating energy range. Factors that reduce neutron transmission are neutron absorbing impurities, lattice defects, and graphite powder inclusions.
-	The room temperature transmission of 11.6 meV neutrons through 50 mm of the material along the c-axis shall exceed 80%. 

This material must be received by NIST within six (6) months after NIST acceptance of Item 0001.
Overall Physical Dimensions and Lamination Requirements
The segment of the post-first article production run shall be delivered as an accurately dimensioned body. The physical dimensions, tolerances and surface finish are specified on the attached drawings, which is numbered 038-0075 rev 3.

The filter may be built as a laminated structures detailed by the Contractor. The following requirements ensure that the potentially laminated body can be mounted effectively and that there are no open joints along beam axis 
-	Lamination planes shall be perpendicular to the central axis of the filter.
-	This requirement is to prevent streaming through cracks in the lamination. The lamination structure shall preclude straight line neutron propagation within 10 degrees of the cylinder axis without passage through at least 35 mm solid graphite. 
-	The overall density of the laminated body with volume as defined by the corresponding drawings shall be at least 95% of the density of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. 
Other Requirements:
Certified Materials Analysis (Items 0001 and 0002)
The materials delivered under this purchase order (both first article and first article production) shall be accompanied by a certified materials analysis indicating the graphite and impurity content and the average mosaic distribution as measured through X-ray diffraction. Neutron measurements will be carried out by the TIC to determine whether the mosaic and transmission requirements are met. 
Acceptance of First-Article Testing Samples (Item 0001)
The TIC will perform at least two types of analysis on the first article sample and report the results to the Contractor via the Contracting Officer.
 
Neutron diffraction will be used to determine the mosaic distribution. 
The neutron transmission along the c-axis through 50 mm of material will be measured.

All measurements will be carried out using 11.6 meV neutrons. This energy has been chosen because it is in the middle of the useful energy range for the filters on MACS and because it is an energy where graphite can be used to remove higher order contamination.
Similar analysis may be performed on the full shipment when received to ensure compliance with specifications. Throughout the performance period, the TIC will carry out mosaic and transmission measurements as needed to ensure that the final product satisfies specifications. Such measurements will be carried out and reported to the Contractor within 2 weeks of receipt of a sample. 
Acceptance of Post-Sample Production (Item 0002)
The following acceptance tests may be carried out by the TIC for the post-sample production to ensure compliance with specifications: 

Physical inspection to assure that the dimensions and tolerances are consistent with the supplied drawings. 

Measurement of the weight of the filter to determine whether the overall density (with volume as specified by the corresponding drawing) exceeds 95% of the density of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. 

Measurement of the overall mosaic distribution of the filter using 11.6 meV neutrons. 

Neutron diffraction measurements to ensure that the average c-axis direction coincides with the high symmetry axis of the filter to within 1o.

Measurement of the neutron transmission along the c-axis and through 50 mm material for 11.6 meV neutrons. 

DELIVERY FOR BOTH ITEM 0001 AND 0002 SHALL BE FOB DESTINATION.  The Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with standard commercial procedures.

The U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Security specifically identified the need for additional exterior lighting in their security inspection report for the NOAA Newport Research Station. Services Required All fixtures must be purchased through this contract. All fixtures and light bulbs must meet UL specifications. Energy needs and environmental concerns should be met when selecting appropriate fixtures. Additionally, the fixtures and lighting selections should enhance the aesthetic value of each building and the fixtures should be corrosion resistant sufficient to withstand the marine environment. The list of fixtures and their locations are as follows: Replace pole top fixtures in parking courtyard with dark sky metal halide fixtures. Add 10 evenly spaced pole lights along road between Fisher Bldg and 950 Bldg, extending from the parking courtyard to the far end of Bldg 951. Lights to be on 12 foot direct burial fiberglass poles similar to existing roadway style. Add forward throw soffit lighting to perimeter of 950 and 951 Bldgs, replacing the existing soffit lighting. Approximately 60 fixtures. Add 5 evenly spaced pole lights along road from Fisher building to dock. Lights should be metal halide, on fiberglass poles similar in height and design to existing “cobra-head” fixture on the dock. The outmost light pole should replace the existing cobrahead. Install Cutoff floodlighting to East side of Barry Fisher Building. This should illuminate the east side courtyard out to the shore, without shining into the harbor where it would conflict with vessel navigation and can either replace the existing lighting, or be in addition to it. Additional Requirements All lighting to be of the Dark Sky type with shielding or internal reflectors that prevent light from entering windows. All completed work will be in compliance with the International Mechanical Code, the International Electrical Code, the International Building Code, and any other applicable International Code Council (ICC) codes. All work will be completed under the oversight of a licensed electrician in the State of Oregon. All electrical circuits are to be grounded with equipment grounding conductor (green wire). An electrical inspection will be done after the completion of the project. Work will be completed by December 31, 2005. This ia a simplified acquisition. All responsible source may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Any potential contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration at www.ccr.gov in order to be eligibale for award. 1. 52.204-8 ANNUAL REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS (JAN 2005) (Reference) 2. 52.212-4 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Oct 2003) (Reference) 3. 52.213-4 TERMS AND CONDITIONS--SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS (OTHER THAN COMMERCIAL ITEMS) (APR 2005) (Reference) 4. 52.225-13 RESTRICTIONS ON CERTAIN FOREIGN PURCHASES (MAR 2005) (Reference) 5. 1352.239-73 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES (OCT 2003) (Reference) 6. 1352.239-74 SECURITY PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTORS/SUBCONTRACTOR PERSONNEL FOR ACCESSING DOC INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS (OCT 2003) (Reference) 7. 52.243-1 I CHANGES--FIXED-PRICE (AUG 1987)--ALTERNATE I (APR 1984) (Reference) 8. 52.244-6 SUBCONTRACTS FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Dec 2004) (Reference) 9. 52.204-3 TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION (OCT 1998) (a) "Definitions."

Material Conform to the following specifications: Use ASTM A588 unpainted weathering steel for the major superstructure components (girders, diaphragms, etc.) and ASTM A36 galvanized steel for the decking. Use fasteners and hardware consistent with the major metal components being joined. Use Coast Region Douglas Fir timber for the timber running surface. Ensure that all structural timber and lumber are seasoned and dried at the time of fabrication. Material that has become twisted, curved, or otherwise distorted prior to assembly into the final structure will be cause for rejection.
Design Features Provide a modular design that employs steel wide flange or plate girders as the main load carrying members. Design and fabricate the bridge such that the components may be assembled in the field with basic tools and skills. Make all field connections using high strength bolts. Furnish a bridge consisting of longitudinal sections joined along their edges to form the full width structure. Furnish all necessary bearing assemblies, anchor bolts, and connectors to fully assemble the bridges on concrete abutments. Furnish a bridge with a span length sufficient to meet the overall bridge length as indicated in the elevation view shown below. To facilitate shipping, handling, and erection, design and fabricate the bridge to be field spliced at the 1/3 and 2/3 span points. The minimum bridge width is 8.56 meters as indicated in the following diagrams. Furnish a metal transverse deck with a timber running surface as indicated on the bridge typical section drawing. Install the metal decking and timber running surface prior to shipping. Single runs of deck plank may be left loose to facilitate connecting metal deck sections at the longitudinal joints. Provide appropriate hardware to fasten these planks after the bridge is assembled
Future plans for this bridge include removing and discarding the timber running surface and paving with an asphalt-wearing surface. Provide a paving dam along the outside edge of the metal decking to contain the future asphalt-wearing surface. Rig main superstructure components with lifting devices to facilitate efficient installation of the bridge using equipment common to logging or construction operations. Place lifting devices so as not to interfere with traffic utilizing the structure, or make provisions to remove the lifting devices after the bridge is assembled in place. Submittal Requirements Prepare drawings as necessary to adequately fabricate the bridges. This includes, but is not limited to, bridge detail plans including girder and deck member dimensions, anchor bolt layouts, erection drawings or instructions. Include in the General Notes any relevant information necessary to perform an independent structural check of the design including design loads, material engineering properties, and any design assumptions. Furnish erection instructions including a full list of bridge components, hardware, and fasteners. Furnish four sets of drawings and one set of supporting calculations for acceptance before performing work covered by the drawings. If drawings are returned for revision, correct and resubmit for acceptance. Allow 14 days per submission. If drawings must be resubmitted, the time for acceptance starts over. Obtain prior written approval for changes or deviations from the accepted drawings. Limit drawings to a maximum size of 610 by 920 millimeters. Include on each drawing and calculation sheet, the project number, name, and other identification as shown in the contract. Alternatively, review drawings may be submitted in electronic format using AutoCAD, Micro-Station, or Acrobat file format. Final acceptance drawings (record set) and calculations shall bear the seal and signature of a professional engineer proficient in bridge design.
Design Criteria Design the bridges according to AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges, Seventeenth Edition, 2002, with Interim Specifications or AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, Third Edition, 2004. Use either AASHTO MS 22.5 (HS 25), or HL-93 for the design live load vehicle (according to the design method chosen). Provide for 75 mm future asphalt wearing surface in computing the dead loads. Design the bridge rails, rail posts, and connections using the full AASHTO loads as specified in either of the above listed design specifications.

Furnish a copy of all mill orders and certified mill test reports. Show on the mill test reports the chemical analyses and physical test results for each heat of steel used in the work. Furnish certified mill test reports and production certifications before the start of fabrication using material covered by these reports. Material may be furnished from stock, which can be identified, by heat number and mill test report. Do not drill, cut, or weld portions of structural members unless shown in the plans or approved in writing. Fabricate (mill, grind, or weld as shown on the approved plans or as specified) end bearing stiffeners for girders and stiffeners intended as supports for concentrated loads to provide full bearing on the flanges to which they transmit load or from which they receive load. Fabricate intermediate stiffeners not intended to support concentrated loads to provide a tight fit against the compression flange. Finish bearing and base plates and other bearing surfaces that will come in contact with each other or with concrete to the ANSI surface roughness defined in ANSI B46.1, Surface Roughness, Waviness and Lay, Part I, as shown in the following table.

ANSI Surface Roughness Values
Bearing Surface	Surface Roughness Value(µm)

A: Yes

Q: When will the walls be finished?
A: Approximately 8 June 2005

Q: Is there a loading dock?
A: Yes

Q: What is the width of the interior door jams?
A: 34.5 inches

Q: Are the lecterns pictured in the drawings a part of this bid package?
A: No they will be a part of a future package

Q: What is the building completion date?
A: 15 August 2005

Q: What type of Internet connection will be offered?
A  LAN they will not be wireless

Q: Is the PDF File to scale?

Q: How can bid be submitted?  
A: By Mail, Fax, E-mail

Q: How is the electrical system to be set up?
A: It will be hard-wired from the wall.  

Q: Can the drawings be saved to an ACAD2000?
A: Yes they can be saved to Acad2000.

Q:  What is the size of the LCD monitors?
A;   17” LCD’s.

Q.  Are power clusters required on the 42x30 desks also, or only on the 72x30 desks?
A:  Yes they are required for both desks.

Q.  The additional power spec is unclear, it says that the power cord must be long enough so that the strip can go into the farthest desk from the wall.  On a four desk cluster that will be 168" from the wall (is that correct for cord length)?
A:   Can’t give a specific dimension. That would depend on the vendors desk sizes, but the idea is to leave enough slack that the cords can reach furthest desk from the wall.



Q.  On the three desk clusters how many power strips will be required?  The spec only mentions each group of 4
A: Two power strips for each three desks.  

Q: Can more specifics be given on the chair requirement?
A: The principal characteristic that we are looking for in the chairs is that they function with the desk that are in each offerors' proposal.  They need to meet the guidelines in the statement of work.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor’s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be received not later than 05 August 2005, 10:00 A.M. Pacific Standard Time.  Quotations received after that date and time will not be considered.  Electronic offers submitted via FAX to 510-637-5978 Attn: Janyce DeCanto or by email to jdecanto@d11.uscg.mil are acceptable and strongly encouraged.

<DESC>Amendment-02 for Solicitation RFQ-NCI-50052-NV is being issued to answer questions received from an interested vendor.     The due date for proposal remains unchanged at August 17, 2005 at 1:00PM EDT.

Question 1:

Can you provide an estimated Level of Effort for this project?  For example, a literature search of published and gray literature can be a very big effort in this field. Have an estimated level of effort would provide some idea of the boundary parameters (amount of effort) to devote to this type of task.

Answer 1:

This is a difficult question to answer as different personnel will have different levels of effort.  Overall, I would expect no more than 10% of the PI’s total effort and no more than 40% of a research assistant’s total effort to be devoted to this.  The literature review plan is expected to be developed and refined with input from the government.


Question 2:

Is this a Cost Plus Fixed Fee Deliverables contract? In this regard, in the section of the solicitation entitled Reporting Requirements:
Deliverables and Payment Schedule, there is no mention of the payment schedule. Will payments be made only after each deliverable has been delivered and accepted, or monthly, based on percentage of deliverable(s) completed each month, since multiple deliverables will be worked on at the same time. If the former, is the contractor to cost each deliverable or will the contract total just be evenly divided across the eight listed deliverables?  If the latter, will the one year contract be divided into 12 equal payments each month and then a monthly report to describe the percentage of completion against each deliverable?

Answer 2:  

Any award from this synopsis/solicitation will be awarded as a fixed-price purchase order.  Therefore, the contractor awarded this procurement will only get paid for what their bid is.  The project officer will approve payment upon acceptance of a deliverables and payments will be divided equally among deliverables.


Question 3:

Clarification: In the SOW, there is a statement "Visits to each geographic area shall include an oncologist." Does this mean that each group meeting must include at least one oncologist in the interview group, or that an oncologist must be a contractor's team member on each site visit?

Answer 3:  

Visits in each geographic area shall include a oncologist, but not necessarily each site visit or meeting will include an oncologist.






This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation RFQ-NCI-50052-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-04.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP) plans to enter into a contract with an organization to provide literature review, interviews and site visits.  The North American Industry Classification code is 541990, and the business size standard is $6M.  This solicitation is NOT set-aside for small businesses.

Introduction:  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), plans to enter into a contract for a preliminary review of information available about the safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, efficiency, timeliness, and equity of cancer care for the purposes of designing, implementing, and evaluating prototype delivery systems.  This contract will support literature review, site visits, case studies, and clinician group meetings.  Using a framework that outlines the objectives of cancer care, the overall focus of the project is to provide foundational information to guide the reliable translation of research evidence into practice.  A particular area of interest in this solicitation is the period of cancer care from suspicion of cancer through diagnosis and plan of care.

Background:  The mission of the National Cancer Institute is to eliminate death and suffering due to cancer.  From a health system perspective, this goal means  eliminating suffering from cancer and/or the effects of interventions and improving survival for patients whose cancer care the health system provides.  From a patient perspective, the goal can be more simply stated: “I get exactly the help I need, when I need it.”  To make such goals more specific, an appropriate starting place and statement of objectives for design of health care processes are the six aims for health care described by the Institute of Medicine.  These aims are applicable to cancer care though they must be further defined and operationalized.  Increasingly, oncologists, health services researchers, and national advisory committees have focused on the need to better understand systems of care including cancer care and at many levels including patient clinician decision making (e.g., clinical practice guidelines, evidence-based practice, accurate and complete pathology services), the flow of patients and information within and across settings of care; and the effects of external environmental factors, such as reimbursement and regulation, training.  Such understanding includes the effects of changes in these arenas on the outcomes of care that matter to patients and policymakers (e.g., clinical endpoints such as tumor shrinkage; survival, health-related quality of life, economic burden, patient experience of care).  In the field of oncology, the need for attention to care delivery, access, and costs is made more urgent because of the pipeline of new, complex, and costly technologies.  Such technologies include molecular medicine (e.g., genomics, proteomics, nanotechnology, molecular imaging) and the anticipated need to tailor many possible diagnostic and therapeutic choices, in a variety of combinations for individual patients.  As in any field, new technologies in oncology bring the potential for error and patient harm as well as benefit.  The complexity of oncology care requires multidisciplinary input, the transfer of patient care across settings, departments, and specialty, and the loss of information about a patient or loss of follow-up of findings will occur unless careful attention is paid to the design of systems that minimizes these events now and in anticipation of advanced molecular and information technologies.  A major part of improving care delivery will rightly include a focus on creating safety systems such that current serious harms from, for example, a mis- or missed diagnosis, use of the wrong protocol or an error in implementing a protocol make the occurrence of adverse patient outcomes extremely unlikely not only in the short run, but also for survival and quality of life.  In addition, informatics and health information systems have the potential for making such information available to clinical settings, linking discovery, development and delivery more quickly.  Numerous studies have shown that even today, many patients throughout the United States do not receive optimal cancer care.  This requirement adopts the six Aims proposed by the Institute of Medicine.  That is, from a cancer care delivery perspective care should be:  Safe—avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them;  Effective—providing services based on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit and refraining from providing services to those not likely to benefit (avoiding underuse and overuse, respectively);  Patient-centered—providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions;  Timely—reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for both those who receive and those who give care;  Efficient—avoiding waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy; and Equitable—providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic status.  Useful ideas, better data on the delivery of care, and a comprehensive approach to system change are needed to focus, motivate, and sustain substantial improvements.  Some published and much anecdotal evidence suggests considerable variation in quality, including the appropriate use of the best evidence, skill in diagnostic and treatment interventions; involving patients in decision making throughout the continuum of cancer care; and using data about practice to improve care processes.  However, it is difficult to obtain data that can be used to assess the quality and outcomes of patient care and to support the care process and quality improvement.  In addition, cancer patients often find the care system confusing and advice contradictory, identifying who is in charge of their care, and have trouble having their needs met.  The overall objective of the work is to identify barriers and facilitators of high quality cancer care; and identify innovative ideas for safer, and more effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable cancer care in the United States; including potential gains in each area from clinical information systems.  The contractor shall conduct a literature review (both peer-reviewed and “grey” literature) on the quality of cancer care; semi-structured individual and group discussions; and site visits to a selected set of cancer care service delivery organizations.  The purpose of the semi-structured discussions with key leaders and practicing clinicians and of the site visits to a variety of oncology settings is to learn from clinicians, senior leadership, health care experts, and patients about their views, gather information for improvement including innovations in care, safety-related issues, barriers to high quality care, and ideas for change, even if not already implemented.  The results of this work will inform future projects intended to design and implement systems to improve cancer care services.   The contractor shall synthesize finding of the literature review, discussions, and the site visits and present the findings and conclusions to the government for its use in designing cancer care prototypes. 

Statement of Work:

Technical Requirements:  A) The contractor shall submit a plan of work in the form of a Gantt chart with dates for each milestone and annotations for each milestone that includes personnel effort and other resources to be used;  B)  Capture and summarize what is known about cancer care quality through (A) review of published and “gray literature” on cancer care quality.  Review the published peer reviewed and non peer reviewed literature in commonly used databases (e.g., PubMed, nursing, health services) and summarize the findings as a literature review with complete citations with a particular emphasis on the period of cancer care from initial suspicion through diagnosis and plan of treatment.  The contractor shall acquire and review relevant articles and relevant references in those papers and search for and gather “grey” literature (e.g., reports and position papers by commissions; papers and websites of professional, health system or health plan, and advocacy organizations) on cancer care quality.  The contractor shall summarize findings of the literature review and provide copies of the relevant references.  An electronic draft of the summary shall be made available to the government for review and comment.  C)  Interview health policy experts, senior leadership and researchers.  The contractor shall conduct at least 15 interviews by phone or in person.  Each interview shall be scheduled for approximately 60 to 90 minutes.  Interviews.  Within 60 calendar days after completion of all individual interviews, the contractor shall provide a summary to the government in draft form for review and comment.  D)  Conduct group interviews with practicing clinicians in several oncology specialties and cancer patients and/or family members of cancer patients.  The contractor shall conduct at least four group discussions, with each group organized around a specific topic or oncology specialty, for example, medical and radiation oncology, surgical oncology, oncology nursing, and/or patient/family experience.  The contractor shall develop the framework for individual and group discussion and meet with the government to finalize the specific criteria required for the framework and shall provide draft guides for review and comment by the government before any interviews take place.  Discussion topics for individual and/or group discussions shall include (but not be limited to) perceived barriers to high quality cancer care, information needs and gaps, and desired functions of a clinical cancer information system.  Both practicing oncologists and experts in health information and information technology shall be included in discussions about integrating patient and clinical data to facilitate the flow of information across settings of care and specialties.  The contractor shall include discussion about how to foster the use of health information systems for informed decision-making by patients and treating clinicians and what value this data might have for quality measurement and improvement.  The contractor shall provide to the government in draft form for review and comment a summary within 60 calendar days after completion of all individual interviews and a summary of results within 60 calendar days after each group discussion.  The contractor shall cover the costs of travel for its personnel and for participatents in group discussions.    E)  Conduct site visits.  The contractor shall meet with the project officer to recommend the location and timing of site visits.  In this solicitation site visit means a geographic area.  A site visit may include multiple organizations.  The minimum requirement is the inclusion of no fewer than three and no more than six different geographic areas for site selection with the expectation that multiple organizations will be drawn from each geographic location.

<SUBJECT>Q--The Texas Army national Guard requires laboratory services for soldiiers participating in Soldier Readiness Processing (SRP)
<SOLNBR>W912L105Q0001
<RESPDATE>090605
<ARCHDATE>11052005
<CONTACT>Luetica Grant, 512-782-5784
<DESC>The above referenced synopsis/solicitation has been amended to include the following: PERFORMANCE STATEMENT OF WORK MEDICAL LABATORY SERVICES INTRODUCTION: 1.1.	The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to perform medical laboratory services as defined in this Performance Work Statement (PWS). Service locations are Grand Prairi e, Austin, San Antonio, and Houston areas. 2.	BACKGROUND: 2.1.	Periodic physical exams and Soldier Readiness Processing (SRP) require specific laboratory testing for each soldier. Specifically, every soldier requires G6PD testing, and blood typing. Soldiers over forty (40) years of age require PSA testing. 2.1 .1.	SB 8-75-10, para. 2-3 dated 20Oct04 specifically states the National Guard will not perform clinical laboratory procedures. Laboratory services in ARNG PESs and TMCs will not be authorized. Operation of these services subjects the facility to Clin ical Laboratories Improvement Amendment (CL IA) certification every 2 years. Supervisors of laboratory services are required to possess a baccalaureate degree in the laboratory services in order to meet CL/A requirements. The costs of purchasing and mainta in laboratory equipment and the requirement to purchase and store large quantities of reagents makes contracts extremely attractive. The Texas Army National has neither the equipment for these services~br a laboratory services supervisor. 2.1.2.	G6PD testing is a relatively new requirement for deployment. It is an once-in-a¬lifetime test. Soldiers recently returning from basic training are the only soldiers with the test completed. Approximately 1,300 soldiers will require this test within the next five years. Cost should be less than $15 per test, for a total of $195,000 over a five year period. 2.1 .3.	Blood typing is also an once-in-a-lifetime in lifetime requirement. AR 40-501 requires laboratory documentation to verify blood type. Approximately 10% of blood types indicated in military records is incorrect. This affects not only the medical fil es, but also the ID card and identification tags. 2.1 .4.	PSA testing is required for males over the age of forty during their periodic physical exam (every five years). 3.	SCOPE: 3.1.	Contractor must pick up laboratory specimens from the exam site in a timely manner, tested in accordance with the Clinical Laboratories Improvement Amendment and results provided to the Texas Medical Command within twenty-four hours of completion of t esting. The contractor shall provide all testing tubes and containers required for each specific test. Contractor shall bill under one account for all services provided within the State of Texas. 4.	APPLICABLE DIRECTIVES: 4.1.	Clinical Laboratories Improvement Amendment (CLIA) regulation Part 493 5.	PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS: 5.1.	Contractor must have convenient pickup locations within proximately of point of service. Convenient is defined as within fifteen miles, there must be a pick up location provided by the contractor. 5.2.	Contractor shall make pickup within 24-hours of drop off. 5.3.	Contractor shall provide results of all tests within 24-hours of completion of the tests. Results must be available through web access. 5.4.	Contractor shall be certified by CLIA. 5.5.	Contractor shall provide all test containers. 5.6.	Contractor shall provide one bill monthly for all services rendered. 6.	DELIVERABLES: 6.1.	Reports of test results shall be available no longer than twenty-four hours after the completion of the tests. 7.  	POINTS OF CONTACT: 	Contractual Matters: 	Luetica (Tisha) Grant (512) 782-5784 	Technical Matters: 	LTC David Gray (512) 782-6267
