<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is currently involved in a project that involves highly specialized statistics. The contractor is to provide professional expertise and services. The expertise of a highly qualified mathematical statistician will be utilzed to develop and validate the mathematical frameworks for research problems, to include continued development and utilization of rotational statistical methods in the prediction of torsional entropy states (positional and energy) of complex molecules in the broader contex of prediction of macromolecular conformation states. Additional research problems may develop, and the statistician will play a role in advising about, developing, and/or producing theoretical frameworks contributing to the resolution of the problem. Precedence and priority will be placed on research problems leading to publications that will communicate developments of new statistical frameworks and methods. WVU Research Corporation already provides the services of statistical consultant and a programmer from previous contract activities. This contract extends and expands this service for an additional year. The statistician and programmer will need to meet regularly with NIOSH investigators and use NIOSH computer services that are protected by U.S. government security requirements. Thus, the statistician and programmer must phisically reside at the NIOSH facility on a periodic basis. The only known source to obtain these services is West Viginia University Reaserch Corporation, Morgantown, WV, therefore, the Government intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis. Organizations that believe they can provide totally compatible services may respond within 10 calendar days after publication of this notice. Sufficient information shall be provided for the Government to determine compatibility. Responses shall be submitted to: Tommy Dorsey, CDC, PGO-CFMB, 2920 Brandywine Road, M/S K-71, Atlanta, GA 30341.  Reference: #2004-Q-10692. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000. Information received would generally be used for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no responses are received within 10 days, award will be made to West Virginia University Research Corporation without further notices being issued. All responses received shall be considered by the Government.

<CONTACT>William Voitk, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-713-0828 x185, Fax (301) 713-0806, Email william.voitk@noaa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with High Performance Technologies, Inc. (HPTi) of Reston, VA to provide an integrated enhancement to the existing high performance computing system (HPCS) being leased by the Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL) in Boulder, CO under Contract Number 50-DDNR-9-90039.  The Government intends to modify the existing contract to acquire additional processing capability, storage, networking, software, and services to support broad NOAA research goals.  The existing HPCS was designed by HPTi to provide a cost-effective, balanced supercomputing environment that includes not only large-scale computing but separate resources for storage, and networking as well.  The current system consists of five Intel Xeon-based clusters (total of 1536 processors), two 64-bit testbed clusters (total of 48 processors), two Data Direct Networks SANs supporting 10 Linux-based NFS servers, an ADIC StoreNext HSM, and a tape library (ADIC AML/J).  HPTi also provides system related support services under the contract.  The current system uses the Linux-based NFS services.  All of the system's resources are managed and scheduled by Sun Grid Engine resource management and scheduling software including custom features implemented by HPTi.  The HPCS currently utilized by FSL and other NOAA users directly supports NOAA's strategic goals in Climate and Weather and Water by enabling its research into the physical processes governing the Earth's climate and weather.  To meet the growing requirements by the FSL user community requires growth in its computational capacity, networking capacity, and storage capacity.  To support the increased computational requirements, the existing HPCS must be augmented to provide additional computational resources, storage capacity, and system support services, including both hardware and software maintenance, through the end of the contract (September 2006).  These additional resources must be integrated into the existing HPCS architecture.  The estimated budget for the HPCS enhancement is approximately $2 million through September 2006.  NOAA anticipates purchasing the additional hardware.  Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government's requirements are invited to submit an affirmative response.  To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates an ability to furnish a system enhancement capable of meeting the previously cited requirements.  Seamless integration of the HPCS enhancement into the existing HPCS architecture is required, including integration into FSL's current NFS storage systems as well as the existing batch system.  Of particular concern to the Government is accomplishment of the system enhancement without any interruption or degradation of performance both during the actual system upgrade as well as during the remainder of the system's life (through September 2006).  Vendors must include in its response, an explanation, in explicit detail, of its plan to implement and manage a seamless integration with the existing HPCS.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion.  Affirmative responses must be received within 45 days after publication of this synopsis.  SEE Note 22.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for an automated scanning phased array upgrade immersion tank system. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the system from ATCO, 320 Old Nunez Road, PO Box 1350, Swainsboro, GA 30401, pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one souce.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  Designs and drawings for interfacing MSFC’s current RD Tech inspection system to such an automated immersion tank system are considered proprietary to RD Tech.  ATCO is the manufacturer and sole supplier of tanks compatible with MSFC’s current RD Tech–manufactured phased array system. As such they have been provided access and use of these proprietary designs, and were endorsed by RD Tech for this effort.  No other known company can provide the necessary interface hardware to connect the existing ultrasonic test instrument with an automated immersion tank system in the time required.   2.   ATCO is the only known company that has the specialized services and critical skills in place to accomplish the upgrades within 10 weeks to ensure MSFC has enough time to use the proposed upgraded test instrument in support of planned Space Station flights.  The time constraints and Return-to-Flight schedule necessitate the need to proceed with this effort in the most expeditious manner.	 The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 07/30/2004.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Synaptic Function Unit (SFU) plans to procure services for mouse behavioral studies, on a sole source basis with NeuroDetective International, 1757 Wentz Road, Quakertown, PA  18951.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The Synaptic Function Unit of NINDS is focused on elucidating the mechanisms by which the modulation of presynaptic function occurs.  Using a multi-disciplinary approach, we have identified and characterized several regulatory proteins that are involved in or regulate neurotransmitter release.  We believe that studying one of these proteins in vivo will clarify the molecular mechanisms responsible for neurotransmitter release and its modulation.  It is for this reason that we have generated mice that lack our gene of interest, and now we would like to pursue studies to find out just how important of a role our gene plays in function.  The contractor shall perform a battery of phenotyping tests of mice.   Period of Performance:  The battery of tests will be conducted over a two month period.  After completion of testing, data analysis and a write-up and interpretation of results (including statistical analysis) will be sent to us electronically and in hard copy form within one month of completion of the studies.  Neuro Detective International is the only source known to NINDS that can provide such testing at this time.  This company's personnel has years of expertise in behavioral phenotyping and data analysis, and are considered experts in this discipline.   In addition, Neuro Detective International owns and maintains the specially designed equipment required to perform such tests.    This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NINDS to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, August 9, 2004.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Solicitation number must be cited on all correspondence, NCI-40111-NG.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Cell Biology (LCB), plans to procure on a sole source basis a Polara Rotation Chamber from FEI Co., 5350 NE Dawson Creek Drive, Hillsboro, OR 97124.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The Laboratory of Cell Biology (LCB) plans to purchase a Rotation Chamber Holder for the Polara 300kV Electron Microscope.  Because of the improved specimen stability and specimen protection, the new Rotation Chamber Holder will significantly enhance the current instrument with capabilities for; 1) Electron Tomographic studies to visualize the 3-dimensional architecture of cells at better that 50A resolution; 2) Structural determination of membrane proteins and membrane protein complexes at atomic resolution; 3) Structural determination of macromolecular assemblies from single particle imaging studies.  The current Polara 300kV Field Emission Gun Electron Microscope is a "state of the art" instrument for electron Tomography.  Current specimen cartridges are capable of tilting the specimen grid in only one +- direction. This results in a missing cone of information in the final 3-dimensional reconstruction. A significant amount of this missing information can be retrieved by rotating the specimen grid through 90 degrees and recording a second tilt series. The specially designed Polara Rotation Chamber will afford us this capability. The Rotation Chamber has been designed specifically for use with the Polara by the microscope manufacturer and no other manufacturer can supply this equipment for authorized use in the Polara microscope.  FEI, Co. is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the Polara Rotation Chamber.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, August 9, 2004.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL)  proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) with Allen Scientific Glass Inc., 1752 55th Street, Bolder, CO  80301 to provide a quantity of 500 air sampling flasks.  CMDL operates a global air sampling network to measure the distribution and variations of climatically important trace gases (CO2, CH4, CO, H2, N2O, SF6) and stable isotopic ratios (13C/12C, 18O/16O).  Whole air samples are collected in glass flasks sealed by means of Teflon O-ring stopcocks.  Because these gases are long-lived and well-mixed in the atmosphere, the spatial and temporal variations are relatively small.  This requires that the measurements be extremely accurate and precise, on the order of 0.03% for CO2.  To obtain the needed levels of accuracy and precision, the air sample composition must not change (gain or loss of any trace gas molecules) during storage in the flasks over time periods ranging from a few weeks to 1.5 years.  Any changes in the materials or methods used in our measurements require time-consuming testing to insure that artifacts or offsets are not introduced into the existing long time series.  Subtle artifacts could lead to erroneous interpretation of the data.  The flasks shall be 2.5 liters in size with Glass Expansion, Ltd. (GE) Teflon O-ring stopcocks.  It must be known or demonstrated that the flasks do not alter the trace gases of interest over the time periods specified.  The flasks must meet the following stability requirements over a 2 month storage period:  for CO2 the maximum allowed deviation is 0.07 ppm; CH4 the maximum allowed deviation is 2.0 ppb; CO the maximum allowed deviation is 1 ppb; H2 the maximum allowed deviation is 10 ppb; N2O the maximum allowed deviation is 0.4 ppb; SF6 the maximum allowed deviation is 0.06 ppt; 13C/12C the maximum allowed deviation is 0.01 per mil (parts per thousand); 180/160 the maximum allowed deviation is 0.05 per mil.  Due to the mandated expansion of NOAA’s atmospheric carbon observing system, the time required for storing and testing any other flasks is not possible. The extensive tests, done over several months, (after receiving the flasks) to make sure they do not affect the gases of interest and are compatible with our existing 5500 flasks, would cause a gap in the collecting of the air samples.  Because of these requirements, Allen Scientific Glass is uniquely qualified to supply these flasks.  Compatibility of their flasks with current stock is essential to maintain reliability of the measurements of the gases within the mandated time frame for this project and have been proven over time.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000).  FAR Clauses in full text are at http://www.ARNET.gov/far/ .  This synopsis is issued for information purposes only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to the notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Governments best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Terms and Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/CONOPS/#REFERENCE  Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date will be August 10, 2004.

<CONTACT>THOMAS M. SEMONES, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 202-564-1128, E-Mail: semones.tom@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA),Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Energy Star Residential Branch (ESRB) has a requirement for the continued development of "Home Performance with Energy Star?" initiative under EPA's Energy Star?  Home Improvement Program. "Home Performance with Energy Star?" is a whole house approach to improving energy efficiency cost-effectively for home owners. Building scientists have long argued that whole house evaluation, analyzing the home's envelope in conjunction with its heating and cooling system, is the best approach to recommend energy efficiency improvements for home owners. This approach is a major component of EPA's efforts to improve the overall energy efficiency of the national housing stock under the Energy Star? Home Improvement Program.  Under Home Performance with Energy Star?, a qualified building performance contractor recommends a set of energy efficiency improvements to home owners based on a comprehensive analysis of the whole house, accounting for all the physical inter-related systems, such as the home envelope that includes windows, sealing and insulation, within a house. To date, EPA has established several pilot programs around the country and  intend to add additional pilot states and regions in the future.  EPA has determined this action will be a small business set-aside.  This requirement is a follow-on to contract number 68-W-02-031 with Michael Rogers. One contract is anticipated to result from the Request for Proposals (RFP). The contract will be a IDIQ with Time-and-Materials task orders with a duration of one (1) 12-month base period and four (4) 12-month option periods. The total estimated level of effort is 9,600 professional hours. Alternate proposals will not be accepted. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541620. It is anticipated the solicitation will be released on or about July 15, 2004. Proposals will be due 30 days following the issuance of the solicitation.  The solicitation, Statement of Work (SOW), attachments, exhibits, amendments, etc. will be available via the Internet at EPA's Internet World Wide Web site at http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/0412010/index.htm.  Prospective offerors are to monitor the Internet site for the status of this solicitation and shall download the solicitation and any related documents from the Internet site as hardcopies of documents will not be provided without written certification that Internet capability is unavailable.  Interested parties must submit such unavailability to Tom Semones. Inquiries and questions can be emailed to Semones.Tom@epa.gov, sent via facsimile to (202) 565-2554, or mailed via U.S. Postal Service to: U.S. EPA, ATTN: Tom Semones, Mail Code 6202R, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Washington, DC 20460-0001.

NIAID is in the process of designing and constructing a state of the art Integrated Research Facility (IRF).  The scanner must be state-of-the-art, with full complements of accessories and modified to suit the containment application at the time of delivery.  The offeror will be responsible for modifications of the equipment to meet containment requirements and will work with the project design team to ensure containment requirements are met.  The offeror will be required to participate in mock up and tests with the design team to ensure the containment integrity and provide for up to four (4) factory trips for a team of four (4) (commissioning agents and NIAID representatives) to witness all acceptance testing.  The offeror shall comply with the following general considerations in high containment:  (1) areas and spaces where animals will be processed before, during and after scan procedures shall operate under the guidelines of Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, 4th Edition (BMBL), CDC/NIH; all standard practices and special practices as outlined in the BMBL for ABSL-4 suit laboratories and for ABSL-4 vertebrate animal holding shall be practiced as standard operating procedures; (2) primary containment, as outlined in the BMBL, will be adopted where possible for limiting aerosol generation of infectious agent and preventing cross-contamination with other experiments.  As such, animals will wherever feasible, be kept in primary containment devices, including during imaging procedures; (3) separation of containment and non-containment zones shall be by a containment barrier; the barrier shall be constructed such that it can meet air tightness criteria (pressure decay test) and withstand chemical corrosiveness testing common for all containment spaces in this project as contained in the BMBL guidelines.  Construction of the containment barrier shall be by the General contractors unless the required equipment forms part of the containment barrier; those parts of the equipment forming the barrier and exposed to the contaminated side shall perform to the same standards as the rest of the barrier; (4) install all feasible equipment parts in non-containment space, separated from the containment zone and orient equipment so that regular and long-term maintenance can be performed without entering the containment zone and (5) maintenance and calibration that can not be performed outside the containment zone shall be performed either once annually (post fumigation of space) or shall be performed in compliance with the standard and special practices as described in the BMBL for BSL-4 suit laboratory space.  To minimize the footprint within the containment area, locate all support equipment and support space in the service floor directly above the magnet or gantry as feasible.  The offeror must comply to the following specific high containment design issues:  (1) containment barrier -  (a) isolate of bore/gantry space; (i) separate the animal (patient) zone from the equipment magnet bore space or gantry and develop with the project design team separation containment by means of a sealed tube extension of the containment barrier; modify equipment (removal of cladding, etc.) to provide enough space inside tube for group 2 non-human primate that is inside isolation device; (ii) assist project design team in designing animal isolator and provide information with respect assist is integration of RF coils within isolator design; (iii) develop calibrated movement system (table mechanics) within containment “tube.” and (iv) visual access of the animal patient is required by the person at remote controls (may be via CCTV); (b) cable routing across containment barrier – (i) assist the project design team in designing all cable penetrations across the containment barrier; (ii) wiring and cable penetrations across the containment barrier must be constructed to meet containment barrier performance criteria; typically, cable shielding will be stripped to expose conductor; solid conductors, not multi-stranded, are preferred and may be required; conductors are encased in epoxy or other material resistant to chemical typically used in containment environments to provide a gas-tight penetration and (iii) provide redundant cabling for future applications.  Unless cables can be changed out, provide 100% redundancy of all conductors; (2) controls and interfaces:  (a) separation of animal procedure and control space; (i) equipment controls and data capture will be separated from animal patient procedure room.  Controls will be operated form outside containment.  Separate animal handler will process animal patient in the equipment.  (ii) animal handler may need to work with, modify the animal patient’s physical and metabolic condition before, during and after a scan procedure, including administration of additional.   Assist the design team to work through these procedures and confirm the ability to safely and efficiently do same (this is not anticipated to require equipment modification at this time); (b) equipment Controls and Operation: (i) customize equipment controls where practical to operate outside the containment zone; (ii) where controls and user interface are required in the containment zone, ensure that the operation is manageable in a BSL-4 suit laboratory environment; (iii) controls, including electronics and switches that are installed in the BSL-4 suit environment must be able to withstand fumigation decontamination processes or must be able to be easily disconnected and stored when the general space undergoes decontamination; (c) communication between control space and animal handler; (3) Decontamination; (a) Fumigation; (i) investigate compatibility with current fumigation methods for decontamination, including paraformaldehyde, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, and chlorine dioxide.  Assist the design team in integrating decontamination strategies with equipment; (ii) modify equipment to promote complete surface fumigation decontamination.

SITE VISITS HAVE BEEN MADE TO FOUR STATES TO FACILITATE A 1-2 DAY MEETING WITH STATE OFFICES OF RURAL HEALTH, PRIMARY CARE OFFICES, PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATIONS, AND HOSPITAL ASSOCIATIONS. NUMEROUS ATTENDEES REPRESENTED CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS AND FQHCS, AS WELL AS OTHER SAFETY NET PROVIDERS, SUCH AS PUBLIC HEALTH, RURAL HEALTH CLINICS, SMALL RURAL HOSPITALS, AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. 

EVERY MEETING HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN BRINGING TOGETHER THESE SAFETY NET PROVIDERS-SOMETIMES FOR THE FIRST TIME-SHARING WHAT THEY DO IN THEIR COMMUNITIES, HIGHLIGHTING SUCCESSES AT COLLABORATION AND EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER COLLABORATION. 

FOLLOW UP TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED UPON REQUEST TO ALL STATES.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated for award to The Lewin Group Inc. of Falls Church, VA to provide statistical and analytical services needed to produce and report Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) error rates.  The Lewin Group provided services to CMS for statistical and analytical support in preparation for implementation of the Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT).  The CERT program produces national, contractor specific, benefit category specific and provider type specific paid claim error rates.  The program calls for independent reviewers to periodically review a systematic random sample of claims that are identified after they are accepted into the claims processing system at carriers and intermediaries.  The claims subjected to sampling and review include all claims appropriately submitted to a carrier, Durable Medical Equipment Regional Carrier (DMERC), or Regional Home Health Intermediary (RHHI); and all claims appropriately submitted to an intermediary, other than acute care inpatient Prospective Payment System (PPS) hospital (Diagnosis Related Groups) claims.  Since CERT implementation, The Lewin Group provides statistical and analytical support as a subcontractor to the prime CERT contractor.  Also, The Lewin Group currently performs all statistical and analytical design services for a complementary Medicaid error rate project.  This sole source procurement is being conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. § 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), that only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency’s requirements.  In order to meet CMS’s minimum needs we require that The Lewin Group be able to conduct CERT analytical and statistical activities independently and thru a direct relationship with CMS.  Award of the CERT error rate support contract to the Lewin Group would insure consistencies with the CERT.  CMS believes The Lewin Group is the only company that can provide CMS with timely and accurate technical support that will allow CMS to make the maximum effective use of CERT findings.  This is intended only as an interim measure until all processes are well defined and documented.  CMS intents to compete the CERT analysis and statistical contract once CMS had fully defined all CERT processes.  CMS expects to compete definition of these requirements by September 30, 2007.  This contract will be awarded for a period of 1 year with two optional years.  This is a notice of intent and not a request for quotations.  Businesses that recognize and can provide the required service described above must provide supporting evidence. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Government will consider all responses received NLT 4:00 PM EDT, 16 Aug 2004. Responses shall be submitted to Edward M. Rutherford.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Ray Jones, (703) 428-2034
<DESC>This notice does not represent a solicitation nor does it guarantee a solicitation will be issued. The Department of Defense (DoD) is seeking to identify potential sources and their capabilities to provide transportation management, network optimizat ion, and related services for DoD freight shipments originating and terminating at DoD traffic management offices, distribution depots, and DoD contract vendor sites within the contiguous Continental United States (CONUS). This DoD enterprise-wide reengine ering effort is called the Defense Transportation Coordination Initiative (DTCI). Current general DoD business practice is that domestic freight shipments are arranged by individual transportation offices at over 500 shipping activities, including 19 Defen se Logistics Agency (DLA) distribution depots. The DTCI premise is that a coordinator with a nationwide view of shipment requirements, empowered to coordinate and manage the movement of those shipments, will produce operational improvements (the primary ob jective), such as decreased transportation cycle times and more reliable time-definite deliveries, as well as monetary savings (the corollary effect). The potential resulting contract to a single transportation coordinator may consist of a multi-year base period with single or multi-year options. The DoD envisions implementation in phases with the workload content (e.g., commodities) and scope of each phase determined by subsequent data analysis. The initial phase is envisioned to include at a minimum the 1 9 DLA distribution depots. Ultimately the DTCI end-state to be serviced by this contract could potentially include all DoD shipping activities located in the CONUS and all commodities. The Contractor shall have the capability to: (1) Select and book shipme nts with commercial providers to include specialized carriage for a wide range of commodities; (2) Resolve claims for loss and damage; (3) Possess or have access to sufficient working capital to make timely investments needed to enable continuous improveme nt; (4) Perform load planning, mode selection, optimization and financial analysis, and consolidation of Less Than Truckload (LTL) freight to achieve better efficiency and end-to-end delivery time performance; (5) Measure, manage, and report performance in  accordance with DoD and contractor pre-determined performance criteria; (6) Manage astray freight; (7) Collect and report shipment status through automated means; (8) Manage multiple domestic shipping modes; (9) Provide automated systems capabilities and business processes using techniques such as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and web-based transaction sets to interface with multiple DoD and transportation service provider systems; (10) Commit to DoD readiness programs including a defined contingency s urge capability; (11) Meet ISO 9001-2000 quality certification requirements; (12) Measure success using comprehensive set of metrics; (13) Meet DoD information assurance requirements. The projected date for release of this solicitation is anticipated to be  early in calendar year 2005. Interested sources should submit a capability statement that details and demonstrates their ability to perform the responsibilities listed in items (1) through (13) above. Responses are limited to 15 pages and must include a d escription of the company and a brief example of relevant experience in the performance of services similar in size, scope and complexity. The respondent to this announcement must also identify its business size and whether it is currently designated as a Small Business as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR Part 19.1. Small business size standards are published by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and may be found at www.sba.gov/size/sizetable2002.html. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 488510, Freight Transportation Arrangement, has been determined to be applicable to this requirement. Responses on company le tterhead must be submitted electronically no later than the date specified above to the following individuals, Contracting Officer Mr Ray Jones at email address jonesray@sddc.army.mil and Contract Specialist Mr Paul Osterhaus at email address osterhausp@sd dc.army.mil

<CONTACT>Pat Hagginbothom, 757-878-4818
<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Center intends to solicit technical and cost proposals on a cooperative engagement demonstration effort that forms Part 2 of the Unmanned Autonomous Co llaborative Operations (UACO) program, an Army Science and Technology Objective (STO). Multiple contracts were awarded under Part 1 of this program earlier in FY04 (Solicitation number W911W6-04-R-0003). This is open to all US contractors and not limited t o successful Part 1 contractors.  The goal of Part 2 of this program is to demonstrate air-ground cooperative engagements using small, highly autonomous UAVs to enhance combat effectiveness of mounted/dismounted infantry companies. The team of unmanned veh icles, including small highly autonomous UAVs should require minimal operator effort to accomplish the mission.  The cooperative engagement demonstration envisioned is of a Future Combat System (FCS) equipped Infantry Company receiving a mission to conduct  a movement to contact.  The unitÃ¢Â€Â™s designated unmanned system user/operator develops a high-level mission plan that will deploy a team of unmanned vehicles to execute this mission, at least one of these being representative of a Class II UAV. As part  of the mission, the team of unmanned vehicles will conduct reconnaissance forward of the unit, detect target(s), track them, and collaborate on the execution or hand-off of an engagement for a chosen target. The team of unmanned vehicles will assist the u nit in executing the mission with minimum human intervention.

The work will include the following:  (Approx. quantities)The Plattsmouth Chute Shallow Water Habitat Restoration Project consists primarily of constructing an approximately 100-foot  wide, 12,211-foot long chute, which exits and re-enters the west bank of the Missouri River. The approximate quantity of excavation required for this pilot channel and related features would be 940,000 cubic yards (770,000 for chute, 170,000 for lake opti on).  The anticipated method of excavation would be by dredging with disposal of excavated material into the Missouri River.  Existing Corps stone fill dikes and pile dikes would be lowered to create the inlet, channel, and outlet.  The chute inlet and out let would consist of designed riprap structures to provide fixed entrance and exit locations.  The project would modify the Missouri River Bank Stabilization and Navigation Project (MRBSN), constructed from 1935 to 1982, by notching channel closure dikes a nd revetment dikes downstream of the confluence of the Missouri and Platte Rivers, from approximate Missouri River mile 592.5 to 595 in Cass County, Nebraska, about 0.5 mile north and east of Plattsmouth, NE.  An option to the chute-only project is to conn ect an existing 25-acre manmade lake at the site to the channel with up-gradient and down-gradient channels.  The connecting channels would be excavated through an existing berm, which currently surrounds the lake.  The lake bottom would also be graded to provide a low velocity meandering channel along with flat, shallow water areas.

<DESC>The Airborne Laser (ABL) Element of the Missile Defense Agency, Kirtland Air Force Base, NM anticipates the release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for award of one or more contracts to provide advisory and assistance services (A&AS).  RFP release is expected on or around 9 August 2004.  This procurement is a follow-on action to the current ABL Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) contract that expires 31 March 2005.  This requirement covers the A&AS requirements for MDA/AL including, but not limited to, Airborne Laser, Airborne Sensors and Laser Technology Programs.  At present, the ABL office requires A&AS support—see Sample Task Statement (RFP Attachment 7 for the Government’s best estimated quantity of hours by Sample Task Statement paragraph).  The A&AS contractor(s) support, provide expertise, and participate in ABL integrated product teams.  The ABL is a high-energy laser system integrated on a Boeing 747 aircraft that is being developed and tested for destroying theater ballistic missiles in the boost phase.  
The contractor must also provide similar types of support to Airborne Sensor (ABS) activities, including mission operations, systems engineering, aircraft systems, programmatic assistance, and other areas as necessary.  Mission operations entail coordination of customer requirements and contractor mission planning functions, as well as deployed support of mission operations.  Systems engineering includes oversight of sensor integration, software engineering, risk management, environmental factors, security, and systems safety.
Finally, the contractor shall provide support in the areas of security, computer network information technology, technical writing, and graphic support, as well as specialized support in contracting, personnel, and program control.  The contract is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ), level of effort, five-year task order contract.  Anticipate contract award in January 2005 with an effective date of 1 February 2005.  This acquisition will be procured using full and open competitive procedures.
	The Government will select the best overall offer(s), based upon an integrated assessment of Technical, Management, Past Performance, Proposal Risk, and Cost/Price. This is a best value source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15.  Contract(s) may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation’s requirements (to include stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors and subfactors to represent the best value to the Government. The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives it the greatest confidence that it will best meet or exceed the requirements affordably. This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Source Selection Authority (SSA) reasonably determines that the technical/management superiority and/or overall business approach and/or superior past performance of the higher price offeror outweighs the cost difference. To arrive at a source selection decision, the SSA will integrate the source selection team’s evaluations of the evaluation factors and subfactors (described below). While the Government source selection evaluation team and the SSA will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective and, therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.  
This announcement is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear the concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate serious concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Potential offerors should communicate first with the Contracting Officer to request information, pose a question, and voice concerns before contacting the Ombudsman.  In those instances where offerors cannot obtain resolution from the Contracting Officer, they are invited to contact Mr. Mike O’Neill at 703.695.9122.  For contracting issues, please contact Mr. Martin Baca at 505.846.0775.  See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION MANAGER as CONTRACTOR (CMc) PROCUREMENT FOR THE MODERNIZATION OF THE EMANUEL CELLER U.S. COURTHOUSE, BROOKLYN, NY.  The General Services Administration (GSA) hereby issues a Pre-Solicitation Notice under which the GSA is publicizing our intention to contract for the Construction Services for the Modernization of the Emanuel Celler United States Courthouse in Brooklyn, NY.  

GSA intends to contract for complete construction services for the modernization of the Emanuel Celler U.S. Courthouse, with general construction contractors (GC) that offer the best overall value to the Government.  The best overall value to the Government includes demonstrating a commitment to construction excellence, providing and maintaining a viable team organization and adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project.  The existing U.S. Courthouse is an eight-story structure with a gross area of 30,096 square meters (324,000 square feet) and houses district courtrooms, magistrate hearing rooms, court support facilities and other tenants. Currently a new U.S. Courthouse is under construction at this site and will be permanently linked to the existing courthouse.  The Emanuel Celler U.S. Courthouse contains 10 district courtrooms and chambers and 1 special proceedings courtroom, some of which will continue to be utilized by the District Court during construction. The project will include asbestos removal, interior construction, new secured corridors, ceilings and lightings, installation of a building sprinkler system (the building does not have one) and replacement of the fire alarm system, replacement of the roof, repairs to the façade, upgrade of HVAC distribution and electrical systems, modernization of the elevators, window replacement, seismic upgrade and progressive collapse protection, and installation of handicapped accessibility features to meet ADA requirements.  THIS WORK WILL REQUIRE EXTENSIVE PHASING DUE TO THE PARTIAL OCCUPANCY OF THE BUILDING.  

General Contractors interested in submitting a proposal for this project are encouraged to submit a letter of interest. The letter may be sent to the Contracting Officer, Francis Cashman, 271 Cadman Plaza East, 3rd Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11201, via facsimile at (718) 330-2043, or via e-mail to francis.cashman@gsa.gov.  Please contact Mr. Mohammed Abdulghani at (718) 330-2030 for any inquiries. The Request For Proposals (RFP) will be issued in Fedbizopps on or about three weeks from the posting of this announcement.  The Estimated Construction Cost at Award for the project is $64,000,000 to $74,000,000.  A Pre-Proposal Conference/Small Business Subcontractor Network Session is set for Thursday, September 9, 2004 at 2:00 pm in the Central Jury Room, Room # 143 at the Emanuel Celler U.S. Courthouse, 225 Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn, NY 11201.  Any questions that offerors may have concerning the price and technical evaluation criteria will be addressed at the Pre-Proposal Conference.  Any scope changes by the Government that may result from the pre-proposal conference may be incorporated into the Scope of Work at any time prior to the final request for proposal submission at no recompense to the offeror(s).  A Small Business Subcontractor Network Session is scheduled to immediately follow the Pre-Proposal Conference.  The Network Session is intended to affirm GSA's recognition of the talent that exists in the small business community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between the community and the firms, which are considering proposing on this project.  Prospective small business subcontractors will be given an opportunity to network with potential prime contractors and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors.  

This procurement is being issued under the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program, and will be open to both large and small business concerns.  The NAICS code for this project is 236220 with a size standard of $28.5 million.  This project is in and will use Metric Units of Measure.  The general construction contractor selected will be required to supply all labor, materials, supervision and constructability reviews during the A-E's Design Phase to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract.  The contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing FAR Part 15 Source Selection procedures in conjunction with the Best Value Trade-off process.  Based on the complexity and importance of this project, the Government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.  Therefore, combined technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than price.  

The Government anticipates the award of a Firm Fixed-Price Contract (see FAR 16.2), based on a final negotiated or accepted price, to the Offeror that provides the best overall value to the Government.  The primary objective of this process is to select the most technically qualified contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government when all factors including price are considered.  The procurement process will have Two Stages.  

In Stage I, Technical proposals and the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) will be evaluated and the competitive range will be established in accordance with FAR 15.306(c)(1). Then, in accordance with FAR 15.306(c)(2), based on the results of the evaluation, the Contracting Officer will limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. For this procurement, the competition will be limited to the three (3) most highly rated proposals.  The Technical Factors for Stage One are as follows:  (1) Offeror's Experience on Similar Projects (2) Offeror's Past Performance on Similar Projects and (3) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel.  The submission of price will be simultaneous with the submission of the technical data.  This price should reflect the contractor's Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for General Contractor Services. 

In Stage II the GC’s shall perform construction document reviews and evaluations of the A-E’s Design Phase thru the Design Development Document (DD)Phase and make a technical and price submission.  The Technical Factors for Stage Two are as follows: (1) Construction Document Review with Written Comments (2) Detailed Project Management and Technical Approach and (3) Construction Process/Management Presentation.  The submission of a GMP for the Construction Option will be simultaneous with the submission of the technical data. The offerors must also develop and propose a firm-fixed-price for the Construction Document Review Services through the 100% Completion of all Documents.  Any and all cost saving concepts and scope improvements measures submitted or discussed by the offerors as part of Stage II become the property of the Government and may be incorporated into the project at no recompense to the offeror.  

In conjunction with the submission of revised technical and price proposals, the offeror is required in accordance with FAR Part 52.219-9 to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan. This mandatory proactive Subcontracting Plan, pursuant to FAR 19.705-4, should encompass the following minimum Socio-Economic Program minimum goals: Small Businesses (48%), Small Disadvantaged Businesses (10%), Women-Owned Small Businesses (7%), Hub Zone Small Businesses (3%), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (3%), and Veteran Owned Small Businesses (4%). The Contractor’s Small Business Subcontracting Plan shall meet the requirements in accordance with FAR 19.704.  The GSA reserves the right to contact agencies, such as the Small Business Administration, to inquire about the offerors past performance regarding small business subcontracting plans/goals.  Information regarding small and small disadvantaged business subcontracting opportunities may be found at the Small Business Administration website: www.sba.gov.

At the end of Stage II, the three (3) most highly rated offerors remaining in the competitive range that fully participated in the competition will be provided a stipend of $50,000 each for their total effort for the services rendered during this stage. At the end of Stage II, the 50% CD Phase, an award will be made to one of the three offerors in the competitive range based on the criteria in the Solicitation.

The selected general contractor (GC) will then participate as a member of the team for the Construction Document Review Services through 100% completion of all documents. The selected general contractor (GC) is to develop a Level 5 Estimate, sufficient to demonstrate the documented value of the Project based on their experience, conversations with their subcontractors and any other means necessary to verify current costing. The estimate will be submitted, in writing, to GSA for their review and consideration and any ideas, problems or information can be utilized to improve the design process. The selected general contractor will submit a list of critical subcontractors. Subcontractors critical to the project including mechanical, electrical, plumbing, roofing, abatement, and fire protection will be asked to participate in this construction document review phase.  Subcontractors will be included in this phase for their technical input and in order to come up with a more accurate firm-fixed price and firm schedule.  All of the critical subcontractors must meet the minimum technical qualifications of the specifications in order to participate.      

The selected general contractor (GC) and the approved critical subcontractors shall participate in 100% & Final Construction Documents, perform a final construction document review with a submission of written comments and participate in all project meetings.  The GC will accept and validate the 100% Construction Documents. The GC must utilize the pricing policy regarding shell and tenant improvements.  GSA pricing policy will be provided to the offerors. Based on the GC’s estimate and any final discussions with the Government, the GC shall provide a firm fixed price for the Construction Phase Option. In conjunction with the submission of the price proposal, the GC is required in accordance with FAR Part 52.219-9 to submit an acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan. If GSA determines that the construction option price is reasonable, GSA will exercise the option for the construction of the project and issue Notice to Proceed. Construction duration is approximately 182 weeks or less as mutually accepted after the completion of the construction document review for the 100% completion of all documents. The Option for the Construction Contract will be contingent upon the availability of funds. 

Closing will be at GSA Small Business Utilization Center, 18th Floor; Room 18-110, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, NY 10278 at 3:00 P.M. Local Time on October 7, 2004, Telephone: (212) 264-1235.

ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS:  The project is a continuation of Phase I of a four-phase program to renovate an 18-story office building.  Approximately 80,000 gross square feet of the 1.2 million gross square foot building will be renovated in this project.  Estimated cost range is $2,000,000 to $4,000,000.  Completion time is 196 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about July 19, 2004.  This contract is restricted and limited to only those firms having (1) an existing general construction contracting office as of the date of this announcement within the bi-state Kansas City region consisting of the Kansas Counties of Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte; and the Missouri Counties of Cass, Clay, Jackson, Platte and Ray; (2) a hazardous materials abatement subcontractor whose on-site supervisors for this project possess the Supervisor / Missouri State Certificate for Asbestos Related Occupations and their most recent required refresher training certificate; and (3) a data wiring subcontractor whose on-site supervisor for this project has been certified by Building Industry Consulting Services International, Inc. (BICSI).

This project will be limited to floors 15 and 16 and various return-air shafts and pipe chases from floors 11 through 18.  The building will be occupied during construction, however floors 15 and 16 will be vacant.  Base Bid contract work includes tenant improvements consisting of new drywall partitions; minor amounts of ceiling replacement; new doors, frames and hardware; paint, plaster, and vinyl base; casework; tenant signage; redistribution of existing above ceiling HVAC; new, and relocation of, existing lighting fixtures; floor box connections for office furniture; new panel boards; and telephone and data raceway and drops.  Base Bid also includes shell work consisting of patching and preparing concrete floor slab for finishes, demolition and asbestos abatement in building return-air shafts at the 15th and 16th floors, installation and finishing of new shaft walls at the 15th and 16th floors, and installation of new transformers.  Option Bid work includes minor modifications in rest rooms and vending rooms; installation of epoxy terrazzo and base, vinyl wall covering and carpet; and asbestos abatement in building return-air shafts and pipe chases from floors 11 through 18.  Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos abatement shall satisfy special competencies and provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.  The Government will not indemnify against such risk.  Construction work that is disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed outside of normal business hours.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures.  Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage 1 will consist of technical evaluations.  Stage 2 will consist of price evaluations.  Offerors must submit their technical proposals and price proposals at the same time, but in separate packages.  The Government intends to use the “trade-off process” in selecting the prime contractor.  The “trade-off process” is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government in terms of both technical qualifications and price.  For this procurement, technical qualifications and price are approximately equal.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the combination of technical qualifications and price most advantageous to the Government.

The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Two factors will be considered - technical qualifications and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management Plan Approach.  Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality.  After all proposals have been ranked according to their technical quality, price proposals will be opened and separately ranked.  The two separate ranks will be averaged together into a single total rank and the offeror with the highest total rank will be considered the most advantageous.  If the ranks of two or more offerors are equal, the higher technical proposal will be the offer considered most advantageous.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include a general scope of work, completed drawings and specifications, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.  In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS).  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch (6PCA), will no longer mail hardcopies of construction solicitations and amendments.  The solicitation (specifications and drawings) and its amendments will only be available through a link in FedBizOpps to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.  Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov <http://www.ccr.gov>) and then with FEDTeDS (www.fedteds.gov <http://www.fedteds.gov>).  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry (www.FedBizOpps.gov) but the sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information (specifications and drawings) will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  The drawings are being provided as .DWF file.  Drawings can be viewed from Autodesk.  Bidders are responsible for producing their own print sets for their use.   

Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  At minimum, all vendors must supply the following information: 

1.	Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) which you should obtain from your Company's CCR Point of Contact, 
2.	Your Company's DUNS Number (800-333-0505 if you do not have one) or CAGE Code 
3.	Your Company’s Tax ID Number, 
4.	Your Telephone Number, and 
5.	Your E-Mail Address.  

Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.

Your CCR registration should take approximately 48 hours for processing and activation.  Once you have registered with CCR you may then register with FEDTeDS to view solicitations.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may register with FEDTeDS via the following URL https://www.fedteds.gov/.  If you have not used the site previously, please go to "Register with FedTeds" and read the Vendor User Guide.  The official planholders list will be based on only those requesting specifications through FedTeDS. 

There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference on Wednesday, April 14, 2004, at 9:00 a.m., local time, in room N133 of the Richard Bolling Federal Building, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri.  Proposals will be received in on Thursday, May 6, 2004, at 2:00 p.m, local time.  Specific location is specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  The Government will evaluate submissions to establish those within a competitive range.

Proposals submitted should be acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  Prior to award of contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.

The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.  All responsible sources not limited by the restrictions stated in the first paragraph the may submit a bid, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.  FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.  

The RFP specification and Construction Documents are available by link via this announcement.  The list of plan holders will be based only on those requesting the Bid Documents via FEDTeDS (see above) through the link contained in this announcement.

QUESTION #7:  What is the authority of the auditor to access licensee information in this engagement? ANSWER #7: The auditor works under the authority of USC35 section 207(a). QUESTION #8:  What is the scope of access to licensee information (e.g., electronic and paper; ERP system components including sales, shipping, inventory and purchasing)?

QUESTION #17:  With respect to the RFP requirement that the contractor "provide assurance that licensees are in compliance with the license agreement," contractors may be in a position to recommend a process by which licensees are required to confirm compliance with the agreement.  However, other than perhaps with respect to royalty payments, the contractor will not be in a position (no matter the level of access provided to licensee information) to provide any kind of assurances with respect to the other license terms (which may include representations regarding the licensee).

<DESC>The Presolicitation Notice originally posted to the FBO on May 12, 2003, modified on June 6, 2003, regarding DESC’s Request for Proposal (RFP) SP0600-03-R-0308 (Draft and FINAL) for Hydrazine Products and Related Services is hereby modified.  DESC awarded Contract SP0600-04-D-1533 to SpaceChem LLC (SpaceChem) on April 30, 2004 under SP060003-R-0308.  An unsuccessful offeror protested the award of the contract to the General Accounting Office (GAO) on numerous grounds.  Based on the outcome prediction process that GAO employs, GAO has advised DESC that it will sustain the protest on one issue - that SpaceChem withdrew its offer and then reinstated it.  As a result, DESC is taking immediate corrective action by recompeting the procurement.  The recompetition will be conducted under the solicitation that the SpaceChem contract was awarded under, solicitation no. SP0600-03-R-0308, as GAO found no grounds for sustaining the protest relative to the solicitation itself or the evaluation process that DESC used to award the SpaceChem contract.  Interested offerors are advised that Amendment 0016 incorporates changes to the RFP that may affect previously submitted offers to include specific conditions for continued participation in the procurement.  Interested offerors are invited to access all related documents at www.fbo.gov, using SP0600-03-R-0308 as a reference number, or at http://www.desc.dla.mil/DCM/dcmsolic.asp?Solicid=567.  Amendment 0016, dated July 23, 2004, posted to FBO on the same date, to the RFP extends the closing date and time for receipt of offers to September 9, 2004 at 2:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time (San Antonio, TX) at Defense Energy Support Center (DESC-MK), Bldg 1621-K, 2261 HUGHES AVE, STE 128, LACKLAND AFB, TX 78236-9828.

NIST also seeks detailed commercial specifications for currently available solutions that can currently be purchased accomplish these objectives, including, if applicable, hardware requirements, software requirements, and any other technical products that would need to be purchased.

Next, NIST seeks commercial list price information (or possible range of pricing if commercial list price does not exist, for whatever Internet video and webcasting services are currently available in the marketplace.  This pricing should reflect how current Internet video and webcasting services are currently priced and structured for commercial marketplace sales, including any tiered pricing that is available based on number of users, number of licenses, etc.

Finally, NIST seeks to determine whether currently commercially available Internet video and webcasting services could potentially be procured on a multiple year contract basis (i.e., contract with a base period of one year and one-year options to extend the term of the contract after that…each year including pre-priced line items for predefined levels of service/licensing/use.)

Respondents should email responses and, if available, commercially available literature and commercial list price information to Joseph.Widdup@nist.gov no later than August 31, 2004.  Such responses will be used to assist NIST in determining how to construct minimum requirements in the event that a procurement is conducted in the future.

<SUBJECT>R -- USJFCOM Focused Forum
<DESC>United States Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) will be hosting an “USJFCOM Focused Forum” on Thursday, August 12, 2004 (1 – 4 PM).  This focused forum will address USJFCOM’s challenge in implementing the Department of Defense (DoD) Net-Centric Data Strategy for the joint warfighter.  The meeting will be held at the Chesapeake Conference Center, 900 Greenbrier Circle, Chesapeake, Virginia (http://www.chesapeakeconference.com/).  Focused forums provide the command an opportunity to disseminate information to industry, academia, and government agencies on a specific joint warfighting need.  USJFCOM, as the Joint Force Integrator, needs to be an advocate for the Joint Warfighter in this DoD metadata environment to work with Agencies, Combatant Commands, Services and Coalition on metadata solutions that ensure interoperability.  This focused forum on joint-coalition data strategy collaboration, will address USJFCOM's current effort towards data integration using metadata technologies such as extensible mark-up language.  Primary objectives for the upcoming USJFCOM Focused Forum include:  1) Successfully disseminating information to industry leaders on the data interoperability challenge USJFCOM faces, 2) Engaging them to discover a process to take data from existing legacy systems and systems in development, 3) Determining what data sets from those systems are required in joint warfighter communities of interest (COI), and 4) Metadata tagging for both discovery and data sharing in a post-and-subscribe methodology.  Agenda includes data strategy presentations/discussion on:  1) USJFCOM Net-Centric Environment, 2) Joint Battle Management Command and Control, 3) Joint-Coalition Data Strategy Collaboration, and 4) Joint Deployment Process Owner Data Transparency.  Free to the public and seating is limited on a first come basis.  Please indicate your interest in attending by contacting the USJFCOM through the website at:  http://www.jfcom.mil/newslink/storyarchive/2004/pa071504.htm

<SUBJECT>B -- Mesurement of acrylamide biomarkers in blood in potato chips feeding study
<DESC>The purpose of the proposed action is to provide the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with a ready source within a 25 mile radius of the CDC campus in Atlanta Georgia with a clinical research center that will advertise, recruit and examine study participants. Further, it will draw and test blood from participants and will privide participants with the supplies needed for the study.  The study requires blood samples being collected and transported the same day to the CDC for appropriate sample processing and analysis, which can not be performed outside the CDC.  Therefore, the institution needs to be in close proximity to the laboratory to assure appropriate sample transfer.  Since this is a feeding study, in which a large number of participants need to be processed within a short period of time (overall 600 visits within 5 weeks), the institution needs to be able to handle such a throughput and has experienced staff availible for appropriate care of the participants (i.e., nutritionist aside of nurses, phlebotomists and technicians). To minimize confounders of the study results, such as biological variability, the study should be completed in 6 months.  This acqusition is a total Historical Black College and University (HBCU)set aside.

<SUBJECT>51 -- NOTICE OF INTENT TO WAIVE NONMANUFACTURER RULE - POWER-DRIVEN HANDTOOLS
<DESC>The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Power-Driven Handtool Manufacturing. The basis for waivers is that no small business manufacturers are supplying these classes of products to the Federal government.  The effect of a waiver would be to allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program.  DATE:  Comments and sources must be submitted on or before August 13, 2004.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Edith Butler, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 619-0422; by FAX at (202) 205-7280; or by email at edith.butler@sba.gov.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act, (Act)15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product.  This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR 121.406 (b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  As implemented in SBA’s regulations at 13 CFR 121.1204, in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months. The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding systems.  The first coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The second is the Product and Service Code established by the Federal Procurement Data System.  The SBA received a request on June 29, 2004 to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Power-Driven Handtool Manufacturing.  In response, SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Power-Driven Handtool Manufacturing, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 333991.  The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule for this NAICS code.   AUTHORITY:  15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17).

<SUBJECT>58 -- NOTICE OF INTENT TO WAIVE NONMANUFACTURER RULE - OTHER COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT
<DESC>The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing. The basis for waivers is that no small business manufacturers are supplying these classes of products to the Federal government.  The effect of a waiver would be to allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program.  DATE: Comments and sources must be submitted on or before August 13, 2004.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Edith Butler, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 619-0422; by FAX at (202) 205-7280; or by email at edith.butler@sba.gov.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act, (Act)15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product.  This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR 121.406 (b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  As implemented in SBA’s regulations at 13 CFR 121.1204, in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months. The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding systems.  The first coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The second is the Product and Service Code established by the Federal Procurement Data System.  The SBA received a request on June 29, 2004 to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing.  In response, SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 334290.

<SUBJECT>DRAFT AIR FORCE ENTERPRISE IT SERVICES STRATEGY (AFEITS)
<DESC><b>Air Force Enterprise Information Technology Services</b><br><br> The Air Force has drafted its strategy for how it intends to implement Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Services.  The AF Enterprise IT Services Strategy (AFEITS) is the first step in developing a consistently managed infrastructure with common AF-wide IT services and processes and is a key step towards the implementation of a net-centric capability across the Air Force.  It is consistent with OSD's planned approach for Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES).  Our next step is to develop detailed Implementation Plans for each of these services and incorporate them in our planning and programming processes. <br><br> The Air Force sponsored an Industry Forum in early February during which the framework for this strategy was presented to Industry and their comments and suggestions were solicited.  Many of these thoughts and suggestions have been incorporated in the AFEITS strategy. <br><br> At this time, we are providing Industry an opportunity to comment on our strategy.  Specific instructions and a link to the strategy can be found at: <a href="https://www.cio.hq.af.mil/public/DraftITEntStratt.shtml">https://www cio.hq.af.mil/public/DraftITEntStratt.shtml</a> We are interested in your experiences in similar efforts that may support one or more of these enterprise services, especially as they may relate to detailed planning of the provisioning of the service and/or performance measurement and monitoring of the service.  We request any comments be forwarded to us by 2 Aug in order for us to meet timelines mandated by senior Air Force Leadership.  Point of contact is Lt Col Dan Altobelli, <a href="mailto:dan.altobelli@pentagon.af.mil">dan.altobelli@pentagon.af.mil< /a>. <br><br> DISCLAIMER:  This is not an invitation to bid or a request for proposal. The information presented herein will not obligate the Government in any manner and it is under no obligation to award any related contract associated with this activity. <br><br> Thank you in advance for your continued support of this initiative.

<DESC>The purpose of this Modification #01 is to post questions and answers related to this procurement.  Question 1: ...regarding item 26.Swing bucket rotor for 13x100ml (Qty1). The volume and number of buckets specified is unusual. Should the specification be for a rotor that holds 13mm x 100mm test tubes rather than a rotor that hold 13x100ml tubes? Will a rotor fitted 4 swinging buckets, each capable of holding 250ml be acceptable?  Answer: Swing bucket rotor with four buckets for 100 ml tubes (size of tubes 13 mm x 100 mm); should be compatible with item 25. Question 2: …regarding Item 17 ... 0.1ng of EtBr stained DNA. The specification is part of the Photodocumentation system. It seems to reference "EtBr" ethidium bromide staining compound and a quantity of test DNA. Are we supposed to include a DNA sample stained with EtBr? Does "0.1ng" reference a detection limit for the camera? Please elaborate on what this specification means.  Answer: 0.1ng of EtBr stained DNA means that the sensitivity of Photodocumentation system should be not more than 0.1ng visible strain of DNA. The company doesn't need to include a sample of DNA with EtBr. [End of Modification]

6. PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

During a meeting with USTDA staff and the Commercial Service at the US Embassy in Brasilia, the Vice Minister of Communications identified a number of projects that the Ministry needs to study further and that could benefit from outside technical assistance.  The main project discussed was the structuring of the government’s Digital Communications Service.  There is interest in USTDA funding for a technical adviser who could provide outside technical expertise on a range of issues that could include the implementation of the Digital Inclusion projects and other issues such as the “informatization” of public security (fire, police, etc.).  The objective of this definitional mission is to obtain additional information and assess the needs of the Ministry of Communications in order to identify the most appropriate forms of technical assistance that could be supported by USTDA.The Digital Communication Service (SCD) was created to implement the Lula Administration’s plan for Digital Inclusion.  The SCD will provide broadband internet access in secondary schools, hospitals, libraries and emergency response (fire, police) institutions throughout Brazil.  The Brazilian territory has been divided into 11 areas that will be auctioned to the private sector.  Carriers will be allowed only one service area in order to create opportunities for new players to enter the market.  The carrier that owns the infrastructure will be required to allow other carriers to use the network to provide broadband service.  The government is in the process of determining how to structure the interconnection prices.  The SCD will act as the internet provider in areas that are not attractive to private sector investment and will be financed by the Universal Telephone Service Fund (FUST).

6. PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The Hemispheric Cooperation Program (HCP) was created by the Trade Ministers of the countries negotiating the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) at the November 2002 Ministerial Meeting in Quito, Ecuador.  The objective of the HCP is to strengthen the capacities of countries seeking assistance to participate in the negotiations, carry out their trade commitments, and maximize the benefits of and challenges resulting from hemispheric integration.  The Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) supervises the development of the HCP with the support of the Consultative Group on Smaller Economies (CGSE).  The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) organized the first initial meeting with donors for the implementation of the HCP in October 2003.  Countries, including Argentina, have prepared the outlines of national strategies for the strengthening of trade-related capacities.  At the November 2003 FTAA Ministerial in Miami, the Ministerial Declaration reiterated the importance of the assistance to be provided under the HCP and called on the donor community to provide support.

There are two main components of the Argentine Government’s foreign trade development strategy:  1) the promotion of trade and Argentine exports, and 2) the participation in bilateral, regional, and multilateral trade negotiations with the aim of securing greater market access.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship is responsible for the implementation of Argentina’s trade policy, with the support of the Ministry of Economy and Production and the Export.Ar Foundation.  

Argentina’s national strategy for trade capacity building under the HCP focuses on strengthening the capacity of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to facilitate their integration into the FTAA market.  The project involves providing a comprehensive set of services, including training and information, to SMEs interested in participating in the international trade.  

The specific activity that has been targeted for potential USTDA assistance involves the creation of Production Information Windows (Ventanillas de Información de Producción, VIPs) that will provide information to SMEs interested in exporting their products.  The VIPs will be supported by a Regional Information System (Sistema de Información Regional, SIRE), which will consist of a database, accessible via the internet, that will compile and update on export and trade regulations, statistics and other information for SMEs.

These projects are very similar to the types of ICT projects that USTDA has supported in Guatemala and Honduras, as part of its trade capacity building program for the U.S.-Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA).

In addition to evaluating the TCB project, the DM consultants would be tasked with identifying and evaluating at least one other prospective project in the ICT sector in Argentina.  For example, the U.S. Commercial Service in Argentina has identified a number of U.S. companies that have sought their assistance to pursue e-government projects in Argentina.  Additional information regarding these prospective projects will be provided to the winning bidder.

Answer:  No, you do not have to have a secure facility and one will not be provided. Question:  Do the payroll personnel have to have security clearances?  And secure facilities.
