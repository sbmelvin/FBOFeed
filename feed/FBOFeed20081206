This is a combined solicitation/synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.       This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     The solicitation number is HSTS07-09-R-00063 which is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).     This requirement is UNRESTRICTED..   The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 611699.  The proposed contract will be for one (1) base year and four (4) one year options.  Services anticipated to begin February 21, 2009.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a requirement for a firing range to conduct mandatory quarterly qualifications and other firearms training.  The range must be within a 20-mile radius of the Field Office located in Edina, Minnesota.

The range must be established range.  This RFP is not a request to build a range.
The proposed range must meet various standards to qualify.  The contractor must make the range available exclusively to DHS; it must be closed to the public during the corresponding hours, and designated training staff must be granted 24-hour unimpeded access to the range facilities.  Because of the unique weather patterns specific to Minnesota, the range may be indoors or outdoors during the summer months and exclusively indoors during the winter, early spring and late fall months.  The range must possess a minimum of five (5) firing points.  The range must be able to accommodate a qualification course distance minimum of 1.5 yards and a maximum of 25 yards.  The range must possess a public address system available during firearms training.  The range must possess movable barricades for the 25-yard and 15-yard course of fire.  The range must possess some type of classroom facility with chalkboard or maker board.  The range must be able to accommodate all handgun calibers.  The range must have reduced-light or no-light firing capabilities.  The range rules cannot disallow movement between firing points or restrict movement-oriented firearms training firing points by students (i.e. standing to kneeling transitions).  The range cannot disallow students from drawing and firing from the holster.  The range rules cannot disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present (i.e. tactical move and shoot type drills where instructor/student ratio would be too restrictive).  The range cannot disallow the shooting of DHS/TSA/FAMS approved steel targets, provided frangible ammunition is used and the shooter is at least 15 yards away from the steel targets.  The range rules must allow shooters to utilize weapons on fully automatic fire drills.  The range must possess a storage area dedicated to DHS use that would allow storage of up to 5000 rounds of ammunition and 150 cardboard target backers.  Indoor ranges must possess a ventilation system that conforms to existing OSHA standards.  The range must have a dedicated weapon cleaning room and suitable waste disposal bins/equipment available for use by DHS employees.  The range must have means to discard expended cartridges.  The estimated HOURS of range usage are 260 per year at approximately four (4) hours per day.  The estimated number of rounds fired per quarter is 60,000 rounds.  Pricing must be submitted at the hourly usage rate.

(2)       Past Performance History.     The offerors proposal shall include a minimum of (2) past performance references for similar services the offeror has provided.
